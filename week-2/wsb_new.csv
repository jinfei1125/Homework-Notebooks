4,Calling all Bagholders - How to make money off your bags while you hold them and stop losses (writing calls and collars for dummies),"Alright you dumb apes, I'm tired of watching you all slowly lose money hoping for another black swan event. If you won't sell, you can at least hedge while you hold to zero.

Many of you are new to this and the vast majority here don't know how to sell anything. Since you love your $AMC, $GME and other meme stonks so much, how about writing/selling calls against them?

What does it mean to write/sell a call? You pick a strike price (not $1000, sorry). The strike price is the price you agree to part with your beloved meme stonks should the price go up bigly again (it won't). You pick the expiration date of the contract. Someone pays you a premium for this, represented as dollars per share. Right now a March 19th $100 strike call is selling for $12.80 a share, or $1,280 in premium. This lowers your cost basis as you get the premium no matter what happens.

If your meme stonk falls, the contract loses value and you can buy it back and sell another if you want. Point is, you make money if the price falls which you aren't currently doing sitting on your shares.

Now for the really smart apes here, you could use the call premium to buy a put and create what's called a collar. A $45 put for instance goes for $1,215 in March. So you would no longer lose money below $45 as you carefully diamond hand your way to oblivion. And it wouldn't cost you anything since the $1,280 call premium covers the $1,215 put cost. You'd even have enough leftover to buy your wife and her boyfriend a mediocre dinner.

Now, this only works for those of you hodling at least 100 shares and of course having a broker which will let you trade options. If you don't have that many shares, sorry. Options contracts trade in blocks of 100 shares.

This is the beauty of options - the ability to hedge your positions as well as speculate. Because if you don't hedge your funds, you might be a Melvin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfkmcf/calling_all_bagholders_how_to_make_money_off_your/,"Dont trade options if you are an apethat only works for people who have at least 100 shares and some of those apes only have 0.757965 sharesThis only looks smart until you realize how retarded it is.

It's slightly less effective against UK variant and only ~50% against SA variant based on phase2 data. 50% is better than AZ but to fax it has the same effectiveness is BS

>All around NOVAVAX is out preforming Pfizer

6,GEVO basically free money with Biden in office,"I got into GEVO when it was $1,70. I hold 5000 shares. I tried telling you about it, but I got banned because the market cap was below 1 billion. Well now it's above 2 billion and GEVO is above $12, but let me tell you. This baby still has \*a lot\* of upside.

GEVO's co-CEO just won the nobel price in chemistry and guess what, she's also on Biden's science advisory board \[1\]\[2\]. Now what are they actually doing? They're making jet fuel from plants. Fucking jet fuel. Do you realize, this is the only available way to make planes ""clean"" in the foreseeable future? This will only change once batteries are dense enough to make electric planes - we're not there and even if we'd come up with the technology tomorrow, it'd still take many years to replace all planes. And it gets even better. They hold a patent on this tech, so only they can do it \[3\].

GEVO is still a small cap, but they can totally play along XOM (200 billion), Shell (120 billion) or BP (74 billion). Worst case at this point is that they will stay where they are, I just don't see how the stock could go down given the circumstances - the next 4 years will be smooth sailing under Biden. This might very well be one of his big projects.

Edit: Oh yeah, I should also mention that you're also basically helping the environment by investing in this. You'll make it easier for the company to raise cash and be successful.

7,Genuine Question- Do You Feel You Can Make Money Investing?,"I don’t want to sound like r/investing, but I was surprised at how many new comers seem to believe the stock market is literally rigged against them... that just isn’t the case.

I know we hate the founder, but his original vision is very much alive and well today. He was a guy who was more interested in finance and public markets than most and wanted to have a forum where he could discuss single stock trades. He tried this on other outlets but was always told “that’s too risky” “most stock pickers underperform” “you are better off buying index funds”. The thing is, all of that is very much true, the only difference with us is that we know this and we understand the risks we take buying single stocks & options.

If you came here because you thought GameStop was the only way to make money in the market, then you need to take a step back and do some research. We take big risks here, but again, we know they’re risky and we know what we should be doing— in fact most of us largely save via index funds and trade as a hobby.

I genuinely encourage all new members to come back after you’ve watched some videos on portfolio theory, the efficient frontier, asset allocation, and the efficient market hypothesis. Almost anyone can make money buying index funds. It might not be huge money, but it’s how most people are able to retire these days. 

Most people who get rich on single stocks were already rich or they got those stocks by being employees of the company via compensation. Most options expire worthless (theta gang). You should know your risks before you come in with your nihilistic outlook and try to protest hedge funds by taking the losing end of their trades.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfk73n/genuine_question_do_you_feel_you_can_make_money/,"The stock market is rigged against them and they can still make money. Both things are true. Just don’t go full retard.You guys are making money? I'm just here for the loss porn and memes.The real question is what happens if you don't invest?

We humble poors need 1,000% returns and that is just not a likely thing; but it does happen.

You needed to have read about GME in Nov (which you could've done here) acted in Dec and been a pussy who cashed out in Jan, and then you got to find the next.I have made a lot of money investing. 95% of my portfolio is logical and medium to low risk. 5% is Casino money.Without real time information you are at a disadvantage.YesYou can make money from investing and people do it all the time.

9,I need some answers on the GME Squeeze.,"Can someone with actual experience in investing help me out? 

So I was thinking, if a short squeeze was still to happen, the hedge funds would wait it out (pay interest on the borrowed stock) and buy all the shares they shorted back at the lowest possible price, logic would suggest that they would have not bought the shorted stock at the peak of 500$ but instead would let the waters calm down ( cause some chaos by driving the price down to trigger some sell off ) and then buy back the shares owed close to the price they sold it for to minimize losses ($5/share I believe).  

Now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?  Also do we have reliable information of when the short expires?   

Keep the trolling and speculation to a minimum please. I need people who actually know what they are talking about... not speculation of ""the squeeze already happened"" or the other side of ""it's going to the moon""",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfjy25/i_need_some_answers_on_the_gme_squeeze/,"You want actual advice in the new r/wsb? Wew lad bless your soul. Go to r/stocks, r/investing, or wherever they are hiding and try not to get your feelings fingerblasted.Do some DD and ask around on other subreddits or even other places off reddit, especially atm this place is being overrun with shills, FUD and bots. But I’ll give you my take! 

The situation is unprecedented, on one side you have massive short interest, like levels unseen, but on the other side, that one that people keep seeming to neglect is the fact that basically no publicly floated volume exists. So let’s say a margin call is made on a large hedge fund that has a huge short position in GME, that would trigger a buying frenzy which would act like a domino and force others with large shorts to buy up to attempt to cover or face paying even more to hold their position due to the interest they pay on the borrowed stock is calculated on the stock price. The problem is, they basically have to buy every share that’s in the public float then knock on the doors of financial institutions that hold large long positions to try and buy their stock too. There’s very little proof to say shorts covered their position and mathematically it’s somewhat impossible (another redditor created a post the other day outlying why, if I find it I’ll link it!). So in answer, it’s not as simple as them buying back stock at lower price to cover their position on the original short because it requires a lot of people to sell and at the moment people aren’t selling. Hope that helps in someway!Originally... before WSB got ruined.. GME was a quarterly earnings play.. maybe wait until thendid u think HFs wouldnt fight back?  these guys prepare for this and while its a god awful shit show...extremes measures are taken when necessary... the market will give you a million over a long long time if you play by their rules, accept that crashes happen when you least expect them, dont question how big money acquires their money... do you truly believe their is enough liquidity in the system to account for every share of stock of every company???With any stock if the short position wasnt reached they have to buy the shares. If all short positions were to run out on one day its go mac 5 then stop. However the stock has been shorted every day since it hit its first jump. Despite all logical reasoning the apes who are holding have a 2a attitude and will hold  as selling would be an actual realized position be it lost or gains. Since each of the puts are not only done by hedgefunds but average joes, one could assert that if all apes veiwed it as non liquidated asset or badge of sorts, the close out positions would continue to be unsuccessful prompting the price to go up in reflection to the number of positions that were not successful.  But I just like this stock.I think the problem is, there simply is no reliable information at the moment because all the available data is outdated.Melvin was required to seek additional funding to meet its position, so their call must have a condition of providing back to the lender a certain % of the share it sold. I'd guess that's around 70%.

Hence if the stock spike too high for too long then shorters wouldn't be able to sustain their positions. 

GME has been heavily short sold for a year. So I don't think paying 30% interest on a 30% margin is the issue, the issue is the stock price.If tomorrow does not play out how everyone expects your dream of a squeeze is dead. $5 to $500 over the last months could have been it, but we've never seen retail investors get all crazy about a meme stock like this before so we might indeed see something spectacular, just understand that to say it is a sure thing is wrong. And this process isn't going to be a short one like everyone says. Maybe the squeeze occurs in a month. Maybe it already occurred. We don't know.Here’s your DD.

One word.

MoonNobody really knows what’s going on. Could be over, could be about to take off, could be dragged out forever and linger until it dies. My only takeaway from this whole situation is the system is corrupt, the government isn’t going to do anything to protect the little guy, and hedge funds can do whatever the fuck they want to win.

I believe on Jan 15th the percentage was something above 80% shorted shares of the outstanding shares.  Since then, the media and hedges have been doing everything they can to drive the price down.  It is blatantly obvious...

For the last few days, GME has seemed to hit a wall at around that $50-60 range.  Which means they are struggling to drive it down further even with the manipulation.  I think the second part of the squeeze is imminent.

16,The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future,"This is my first DD post so please forgive me. I meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.

**What is CLNE?**

Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.

CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from Credit Suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**Why Natural Gas?**

As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML)). This is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). In fact, RNG has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to Commiefornia's Air Resource Board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). With demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**Increasing Natural Gas Demand**

Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which RNG will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now. [CLNE last December reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of RNG](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[Lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from Volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**Partnerships**

CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP, [they are joint owning and operating RNG facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

With Total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**Expansion**

Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI. 

**The Numbers**

Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**The Play**

As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[I am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which I purchased last week (These are printing hard). I also hold 7500 shares at a cost basis of around ~$6.](https://i.ibb.co/CJM6fDY/image.png) I will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that.

17,Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options," 

I did a post a while back talking about how I trade and that I use option flow data as a trading tool for both stocks and options. Ever since then I have been getting random chat requests asking me what service they should buy so I decided to make this post to help new traders find the best flow for them. Warning: This may be boring and I have tested out all of these options during the month of January.

First, what is option flow and why do people use it. Options flow data is a tool that helps you understand how hedge funds and institutional investors feel about certain stocks and ETF's. I use it daily to help me decide what positions I want to open or at least what I should be adding to my short, medium, and long term watch lists. There are two big names on the website side and two names on the app side that are worth using in my opinion. If anyone has any other sources please feel free to comment them down below. One I haven't used before is Blackbox.

3. Cheddar Flow[ https://www.cheddarflow.com/](https://www.cheddarflow.com/)
4. OptionsFlow[ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow) (Website is broken I think)

Apps

TitanFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is 0$, Basic Plan is $30, Premium Plan is $50

TitanFlow is probably the best option for mobile traders who use apps like Webull, Robinhood, TastyWorks, etc... TitanFlow is a new app that recently launched in December if I remember right. I signed up for the premium plan and overall I would give it an 8/10. The app is broken up into 4 parts.

Snapshot Page: This is a macro-level view of what stocks have the most premium being traded throughout the day. I didn't really use this page much mostly because I am a swing trader but if you like to trade options that expire within seven days this may be useful to you. You also can access the basic historical search feature through this page.

Flow Page: This is where I spent most of the time on the app. This is where you can see thousands of pieces of unfiltered flow being sent directly to your app. You can search for flow on specific stocks or ETF's and filter them based on your needs. You have fifteen filters you can use which was more than enough for me to find some decent plays using this app. You can also sort the flow by the cost, expiration date, time of the trade, and strike price. You can also access the premium historical search feature from this page.

Today's Contract Page: Not sure why they named it this way but from what understand this page will give you flow alerts based on velocity. I have seen some alerts make people 400% in one day but I have also seen some that have dropped over 50% for more volatile stocks. If anything I just use it to find potential day trade opportunities. You can also filter these alerts so that you only see certain types of flow.

Flow Alerts Page: You won't spend much time on this page but it can be extremely useful for finding bullish flow for specific stocks and ETF's. You can be pretty precise on what type of flow you want to be alerted to. For example in general I like to be alerted when a piece of flow has a minimum premium of one million, is a call, was traded at the asking price, is out of the money, is unusual, and expires within fourteen days. You can set as many alerts as you want but be careful or your phone will start beeping nonstop.

Downsides: The downside is that it's an app, it does not have all the tools that a website like FlowAlgo might have. Flow crashed the app once. To be fair it only happened once but last weekend during that weird crash I think the servers couldn't handle all the flow being traded. I believe it caused CheddarFlow and OptionsFlow to have issues as well. The last real downside I see here which isn't all bad is that the app has major updates every few weeks and when that happens it may take a day or two to understand the new feature they added.

OptionsFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is $0(Has Ads), Basic Plan is $20

This app really bad but it's the only other app on the market that I could find besides TitanFlow so I feel like I should review it just in case it gets better in the future. For now, I would stay far away. I would give it a 1/10 because of its many bugs and the fact that it has ads. OptionsFlow has been around since November and has been changing a lot which has been both good and bad I feel like they are trying to copy TitanFlow because they recently made their own snapshot page. I paid $20 for their basic plan. Their app is also broken into four parts.

Snapshot Page: This page gives you a macro-level view of what's going on in the market. a big problem here is I paid for the premium service but I am still having ads blasted in my face. Besides the ads, it looks clean and organized which is a plus.

Today Option Flow Page: This page streams flow through the day but for some reason, it appears to have less flow than every other provider that I have reviewed. Now you may love or hate this but I ended up hating the fact that they only show you flow that was traded at the ask. (You can only see what is being bought and not sold) I like having access to all the data and then filtering it to match my needs. OptionsFlow has eight filters you can use which is less than the other apps and websites but it’s better than nothing. The last thing about this age is during after-hours the flow page goes blank and says ""there is no options flow today"" which can be confusing if are new to option flow data.

Historical Option Flow Page: Not sure what they are trying to do here but the historical page is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FLOW PAGE. The only difference is the name of the page so this page doesn't need another review.

Dark Pool Prints Page: I did not have any real problems on this page which brought a smile to my face. I checked out the dark pool prints and tried to trade using the data but didn't really have much success. Some people may have better luck than me in using the data though.

Downsides: There is a lot of downsides right now so I would stay far away from this for now. When I pay for a product I want the product to be in working order and do not want to be forced to watch ads when the basic plan is supposed to get rid of them.

Websites

FlowAlgo

Cost Per Month: $150

I enjoyed using FlowAlgo and if you trade with over 10k and trade from home this will probably be your favorite place to get option flow data. The way the websites are laid out is much different than how the apps are laid out which has its ups and downs. The platform is algorithmically built to monitor all the essential details that you require to track sweep orders. FlowAlgo reveals these orders and executes them as soon as possible. In the dashboard panel, you can filter these orders. The dashboard panel looks intuitive, presenting the overall sentiment and the trading volume. One of the best features is that FlowAlgo lets you spot dark pools. You can filter and sort to your heart's content which can be very helpful when you're looking for potential play. It also has a chat feature where you trade ideas with other traders. I would give it a 9/10. FlowAlgo has the most features of any option flow product on the market. 

Downsides: This service is very expensive and might be out of reach of most new retail investors. Another downside I have found is that it can feel overwhelming and can take a few weeks to get the hang of.

CheddarFlow

Cost Per Month: Standard Plan $85, Professional Plan $99

If you cannot afford FlowAlgo this may be your next best bet if you want to use a website. CheddarFlow definitely feels like a watered-down FlowAlgo but still valuable. The layout is simple which I liked and the quality of flow was pretty close to FlowAlgo. Cheddar Flow’s main objective is to make options money flow more accessible and easier to understand for everyone, especially for newbie traders. I did find their service much easier to understand than FlowAlgo but that is also because there were fewer features to learn how to use. Overall I would give this website a 7/10. I think if they can match FlowAlgo's features but stay at their current price this may one day be my top pic.

Downsides: Expensive for what you are getting. I feel like they need more features to justify their high price point. Their customer service can be hard to get in touch with and I have heard they can charge you before your free trial is up which can be very annoying if you trying to unsubscribe a day before your trial ends.

18,Extra Dumb Question about AMC,"Ok, so yes, I know we're all shooting for a short squeeze, but on the other hand, Wanda (which owns 60% of AMC) has filed to be able to sell its shares, which, if it does, could lower the market further, and I'm seeing analysts with a target price of $2/share.

So here is my extremely dumb question: if the shares fall low enough and Wanda sells, could r/wallstreetbets theoretically buy a majority, and, operating as a voting block, start to install its own board members?

I know lots of people think theaters are dying, etc, and AMC isn't a good long long, but here is why I ask - I work in entertainment research. I know there are ways of restructuring the company and changing things for theaters that are actually really popular with moviegoers that theaters have been largely ignoring because old people (read: people in charge of actually making the decisions), don't get it, don't believe it, and are generally resistant to changing the business model. But it's real. The potential is there, the ship could still be turned. 

Anyways, I know I'm probably retarded for asking this question, buuuuut, I also kind of see it as a way to turn around from a bagholder situation? It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it could maybe work to get the price back over $30?

3. You like CRSP this is CRISPR 2.0. At most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful CSPR treatments and trials.

4. CRSP comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people With crspr FoMO.

5. ANY significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price

6. Very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons it’s a good stock are exact reason why it’s a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)

20,Robinhood's piece-of-shittery extends to them preventing me from withdrawing my money as I attempt to leave.,"Like many who were appalled by Robinhood's behavior in limiting GME buying at the most critical time, I made the easy decision that I'd abandon the platform in favor of a real brokerage (Fidelity for me). This morning I attempted withdrawing my funds from my Robinhood account only to experience two different errors, shown [here](https://imgur.com/a/2Ws8qcP). 

One error is about some mysterious additional verification that I need to complete, but with zero ability to initiate that, other than going to their support team. It also suggests the issue is due to the account I was attempting to withdraw to.

So, I tried withdrawing to the other one of my two linked bank accounts, only to receive an ""unexpected server error."" The error message suggests trying again later. Well, I've tried about 10 different times today and get the same message every time.

22,How to read DD on WSB.,"So you've found a post, and it looks damn good - nicely formatted, seems to have a lot of fancy words, and you don't know how to even begin evaluating their theories.  So, what do you do?

Analyze their analysis!

First, is the user reputable/legitimate, or is it a bot post?  Check their user history - if they've been around for a while, and post to other forums, and have no massive gaps in their online-time, they're probably real.

Second, if it's a real user, are they trying to shill something for market manipulation or pump&dumping?   If so, they'll usually be banned/deleted very quickly, but if you're browsing /new DDs you'll need to be vigilant.  Avoid penny stocks or anything where the goal is specifically purchase->effect-oriented.  If the OP has proof of positions, and it doesn't look like a pump&dump, then at least they're buying into their own theory - and I trust theories people are willing to bet on as they posit them more than theories that are just like, ""I don't wanna but good luck all"".

Third, the actual content of the post!  Do you understand what they're pitching?  If not, do the comments explain anything that might be confusing?   Make sure you actually understand the theory you're buying into.    If you understand it, the next question is, ""how reasonable does this seem""?  If it's something that's blindingly obvious even to a layman, it's possible that the market's already priced it in and no movements will be made based on the information.  If it's totally far-fetched, like banking on a specific individual dying or lottery-level odds, probably worth skipping.    The sweet spot, the ideal, the diamond in the rough, is finding DD that invokes new thoughts that no one has had, but are totally reasonable and likely.    Read comments, see what the consensus is, and pay special attention to dissent - dissent is way more useful than agreement for furthering a theory.  Read their sources, or do independent research - see if other factors support their theory, see how well-known or popular the theory is already, and evaluate based on that.

Now if you decide that you like the DD, and may act on it, you have to choose *how* you act on it.   And this is the very, very hard part - opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis.  Is buying into this new theory superior to any existing theories you're currently acting on?  Does it match your risk profile?  Is it a stock DD, or an options recommendation?  How much are you willing to gamble?  What is your exit strategy?  Can't help much here, that goes into actual financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor, just a ""how to judge random idiots on the internet"" expert.

Let's say you don't like the DD - you're not gonna buy in.  But what if you think that the person's crazy?  What if you think their theories are not just baseless, but are actually wrong?  You may choose to bet **against** the DD!  And yes, you can do this with anything you read - you can decide that they're stupid, fuck em, and bet against them.  Their loss porn becomes your gains, and vice-versa.  Investing in inversing bad DD is a valid option - they're buying up options, you can sell some options, or buy puts below their calls, or so on.

Retail trading is mostly treated as noise by hedge funds - but just because it's not your day job to trade doesn't mean you can't do research that hedge funds may miss.  As retail investors, it's extremely difficult to have a superior trading strategy or more general market knowledge than the professionals, but we can figure out niche opportunities that the higher-level analyzers miss.  If you intimately know an industry, or have a theory that you think financial institutions would miss, or think you're just smarter or more well-informed than them, absolutely develop a DD post (aka a market theory) and share or act on it.

tl;dr:  If you're the kind of nerd that scrolls to tl;drs and makes decisions based on that, then all the other shit I said is irrelevant, :rocket: :diamond: :ape: ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi3va/how_to_read_dd_on_wsb/,"Wait so you’re not supposed to just scroll to the TL;DR in search of confirmation bias?You have high hopes for us, we like youSir, this is the unemployment line.

23,BlackBerry this is a song for you.," 

Woke up quick at about noon  
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon  
I gotta get drunk before the day begins  
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends  
About to go and damn near went blind  
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs  
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip  
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip  
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon  
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'  
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride  
I got front back and side to side  
Then I let the Alpine play  
Bumpin' new shit by NWA  
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list  
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this

Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'  
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes  
Went to the park to get the scoop  
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops  
A car pulls up, who can it be?  
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G  
He rolls down his window and he started to say  
It's all about makin' that GTA

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Down on B's in the place to give me the pace  
He said my man JB is on freebase  
The boy JB was a friend of mine  
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine  
Chased him up the street to call a truce  
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce  
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge  
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill  
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill  
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar  
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala  
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'  
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'  
Left to get my girl, to rock that body  
Before I left I hit the Bacardi  
Went to her house to get her out of the pad  
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad  
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe  
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave  
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?  
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe  
Her father jumped up and he started to shout  
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control  
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll  
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother  
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""  
Walkin home and I see the G ride  
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side  
As they busted a U, they got pulled over  
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova  
Kat got beat for resistin arrest  
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess  
Now G is cut for doin the crime  
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I went to get them out but there was no bail  
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail  
Two days later in municipal court  
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork  
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge  
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge  
Bailiff came over to turn him in  
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin  
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi  
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi  
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her  
Both up state for attempted murder

24,"Don't let people shame you into buying, selling, or holding your stock","I jumped on the train like everyone else, but began to notice a lot of malice and discord between people who think differently about the future of these meme stocks.

The important thing people need to remember is everyone on here is a stranger. We joke and talk shit which is fine and all, but you have no idea what people are doing outside of what they commented. The majority of people here are likely in it for themselves. You don't know what their motivation is, be it telling people to buy/hold for those looking to cash in, those who ""just like the stock"", or those that say sell because they are ""shills"" or have some other ulterior motive. Maybe they are trying to look out for you. Maybe not.

At the end of the day stop letting emotions and the temperature of this and other subreddits dictate your choices. What happens here might influence the market, but I've seen too many posts about diamond hands and monkey grips with the stock continuing to decline to think we have any significant role in what happens with the price. Don't put in what you can't risk to lose; it isn't worth it.

TL;DR - If you want to buy - buy. If you want to hold - hold. If you want to sell - sell.

29,DD - Patience is a Virtu,"Well done. Somehow, against all odds, a large number of you autistic fucks have made some life changing gains on GME. This post is in no way encouraging you to sell your positions or even open new ones. Thats because I'm not a fiduciary advisor and know fuck all about what you should or shouldn't do. All I will say is welcome to all the new members out there and if there's one piece of advice I can give you, its to trust your gut.



Now lets get into it. This post is my DD that I wanted to share on $VIRT, not because I am recommending you to do anything, but because I enjoy researching shit because its fun and I figured this would help organize my thoughts. 



So lets get into it. I'm sure most of you have noticed the new exposure this sub has been getting on a worldwide scale. If you've been here even since Dec. in 2020, you'd notice this sub has even gained over 6M subscribers in the last month. I'm not going to tell you I've been around since the start, I've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since I started following a few years ago. The sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. Give this Reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard): https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-numbers-idUSKBN29Y2PW




For those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. To what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? Well back in Jan 2020, before the March crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. By July/August, this shot up to 25%. Some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail. **THE TREND IS INCREASING** for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. So why did i even mention GME to start? Well according to an analyst from Piper Sandler, this past Wednesday set a new record for volume traded for US cash equities of **24.5 Billion** . Thats volume traded, not a $ amount. Options volume also hit a record high in volume at 57.1 Million. For both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. One last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 Million+ retail traders. **100 Million** thats a fuck ton of regular Joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks. 



TLDR: Retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. This in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.



OK Cool. Why does this matter? Well aside from Melvin Securities (Melvin Capitals Market Maker/scum of the earth), there are other Market Makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). Companies like $VIRT, Virtu Financial, that are publicly traded. Lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, Brokers, Liquidity providers etc:


https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BjrX0/1/



$VIRT has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and EPS since their IPO in 2015. This growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. According to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. This is up from 25% the previous year. 
https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/Virtu_2019_AnnualReport_Final.pdf



Ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $VIRT. And turn, higher earnings. Why? This is because those Ask/Bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. They make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times **millions** of trades/day equals out to big money for them. An even bigger wet dream would be if Melvin Securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. Then again, that probably won't happen but regardless **Fuck Melvin**.



So what else? $VIRT has provided a $0.24 dividend for **22 consecutive quarters** and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their Q3 report released in Nov 2020, also making a statement to ""meaningfully enhance shareholder returns"" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. And a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $VIRT has earnings coming up on **Feb 11th**. Thats this Thursday. Lets even take a look at their revenue growth. According to their 2019 full year report, Virtu took in $1.5B in revenues. Fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $2.5B and we still even haven't seen Q4 results yet. While yes, the volume in March/April played a part in this, Q3 revenues were still over $650M, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. Their current market cap is only ~**$5.4B** with a PE of **6.6**. Talk about nice returns. Time to bet on the Casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table. 



TLDR: More retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $VIRT

Planning on converting to shares for long term holding with an eventual PT of $100 by end of 2021.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfhlp7/dd_patience_is_a_virtu/,"I have long thought about investing in VIRT because I want the market makers to make money for me. Same goes for CBOE - if more degenerates are buying options, I want a piece of that. But I tried playing CBOE earnings last week and got GUH'd.

Let me know when this play works out so I can FOMO in at the top and baghold for years... shit will be dopeYou're talking to a sub that gambles their disposable income (and sometimes their student loans) on options that expire at the end of the week. 

Patience is not a virtue here, and people like DFV who hold a position for an entire year are rare. I'd be surprised if anyone in WSB is holding $GME by the end of this month.VIRT has been on my radar since it was $24-25...in March of 2019. They’re a good company with a hilariously low multiple. But they’re so fucking boring. They’re like your mom during sex, they just don’t move.You can see it on those market makers still gaining fees like some German banks:

Lang & Schwarz AG (which means long and black directly translated)

As well as

Tradegate Wertpapierhandelsbank AG

Or

Flatex degiro 

What it means is, the market is hot, hotter than ever 🔥 as always, if you can't stand the heat, don't go in the kitchen.

Prepare for some real crazyness, as all central banks keep goon pumping up money to the streets which will land here. Fire is on. Keep Goin

33,The case for VSTO,"Fellow degenerates, ammo is the next play. Hear me out.

Currently in the United States a country wide ammo shortage is underway. As a guy who shoots all the time, this is a pain in the ass. I used to pay 15 cents a round for 9mm and 25 cents a round for 556 ammo. Now, both are trending from 78 cents and up per round. 

So, I did some research to see why or what components were in short supply. Primers! The part of the ammo that the firing pin hits and makes the gun subsequentlyfire. There are only four big primer suppliers in the United States. Winchester, CCI, Federal, and Remington. 

VSTO just acquired Remington and owns CCI and Federal. That said, I looked at the 5 year chart. VSTO used to be valued at roughly $50 a share in '16, this was the last great ammo shortage (everyone thought Hillary was going to take there guns). Estimates are 8 million new gun owners, and all of them need ammo. Expert consensus is this shortage could last through 2022. The CEO of VSTO has said they are producing more ammo than they've ever produced before. 

The current ammo shortage is larger, longer, and more sustained (like your wife's boyfriend), then in 2016. As of now, the stock price has yet to reflect this. 

I'm not a financial adviser, I know next to nothing, outside stonks only go up and I can't find any freedom pills for my AR.. Hence, me telling you to put your $$ in VSTO for more tendies. 

TLDR: Ammo sales are exploding (literally), buy the main beneficiary VSTO.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfh551/the_case_for_vsto/,"Me, who shoots: Man I wish ammo would come back and prices drop

Me, who trades stock: Ammo shortage good, makes account happyNo-brainer to me.  I opened up a position today and will buy the dips.  Been on my radar for awhile.  I've half-jokingly said ""ammo"" whenever people ask ""what should I invest in"" but now I'm literally investing in ammo.

I see it as also a defensive play, market tanks and cigs/pot/alcohol/ammo will still be in demand.I’ve been in on VSTO since $10 🚀💎🙌🏻Another fun point of reference.  VSTO sold Savage firearms about two years back, which opened their non-firearm holdings up to other retailers who blackballed their products on the grounds that Savage donated to the NRA.  This allows their other outdoor and sporting products to maintain a steady revenue independent of the volatile firearms market.

Personally, if intending to take advantage of firearms' volatile market, I would wait until COVIDs restrictions ease up and buy then.  We just are following election season with a Democratic president, so ammo prices are Apt to peak within the next quarter.   So for VSTO, either intend to sell within a month or so, or short it for Q2.Great dd. Not hating but I feel like a bigger catalyst needed. Or maybe I’m just bitter cuz the minute I get ccl prices skyrocketWhat is the management like for this company and what do thier books look like, what's their forward vision and plan for the next 2 years? Are they holding a ton of debt that would keep it from running up?My stepdad is a dealer (mostly for kicks) and gun fanatic. Can confirm ammo is in short supply.VSTO to the moon!!!!!VSTO is way up in the last 3 months -- It is already riding the highs of the election.As someone who shoots once or twice a year I think its a very safe bet. Primarily due to the ammo shortages and price inflation, I tend to focus less on the higher end ammo and buy the cheaper brands which VSTO happened to have recently acquired. 

They do appear to have cornered a yuge stake the market durring the ammo shortage.",1612806078.0,74

35,PSA: Fidelity accounts (prevent GME/AMC shares from being shorted!!),"Fam,

Just spent 30 minutes on the line with Fidelity. Bottom line: if you have a **MARGIN** account with level 3 or 4 options approval, **THEY ARE LENDING OUT YOUR SHARES**.

However, you can request that they **DO NOT** lend *specific shares*, or even *all of your shares*. You just have to call them. It will go through a 3-5 day adjudication process, and they will either approve it 1) with no changes to your options approvals, or 2) approve it and lower your option level.

Retirement accounts: mine are at level 2 options approval, and the rep told me my shares are **NOT** being lent out to shorts due to these being IRAs and the level 2 options approval I currently have.

Non-qual accounts: if you have level 3/4, they may downgrade your account to level 2 if you request your shares to be ""un-shortable."" This ultimately comes down to the adjudication process.

I hope this is helpful to someone holding shares, and I hope it hurts those cocksucker hedge funds.

Not financial advice / I like the stock / GME & AMC to the 🌖🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: Fidelity customer service 800-343-3548. Don't tell them I sent you ;)

Edit 2: tighten the fucking noose on the shorts. If you're on other brokerages - call them and post the how-to for others. Major military battles have been won by attacking the enemy's supply lines. You're either part of the solution or part of the problem.

Edit 3: I'll hold your hand all the way.... click the tab Accounts & Trade > Account Features > Brokerage & Trading > Options. That will show you your options levels. Tighten the grip! 🐍

Edit 4: hard to quantify, but if **ALL OF YOU** call your brokerage and cut off the lending of shares it will have a major positive affect on the GME share price.... let's call it a ""synthetic"" buy order to further help the short squeeze.

I restock a pallet or two every day from each as people are buying that shizz full price and running home with it.

Companies like Reckitt Benckiser (Lysol, Mead Johnson, and others), 3M, Johnson and Johnson and others that had an interest in the consumer packaged goods space can be an option for boring ass capital preservation or if you're on the final frontier of dividend investing, but for all these companies look at their stock price in Jan 2020 and look at it now.  3M was 178 at the start of January 2020, will have orders out the ass for quite some time since most places haven't even begun to rebuild their pre pandemic medical gear/worker safety stockpiles, and is still just at 180.

So a while back I YOLOed my entire account on calls and [lost it all in 4 minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rftx/loss_porn_for_all_the_new_people_here_yoloed_my/). Like a sensible ""investor"" I wanted my money back, I mean who wouldn't right? So fast forward 1 week and I'm thinking ""what's the fastest way I can make my money back?"". Selling puts of course. 

So I'm looking at these 70,000-80,000 contracts and I forgot I couldn't write naked options. So I went ahead and tried to short 100 shares in order to short 1 contract and receive the premium, but there weren't any shares available to short. I started to panic because I had just lost around %80 of my account and I can't find a way to make it back. Luckily, I managed to find something called back/ratio on thinkorswim, and saw that I would receive roughly the same amount of money. Now, you might be asking which stock and strike price I chose. Unfortunately, out of the money put options didn't give me enough money, so I went ahead and did the next best thing: 780/800 str FDs. Now, these are deep in the money puts, so I am relying on them not being exercised. You might think this is stupid but I think it's smart. Who in their right mind would want to exercise an 80k option and lose all of its value just to short 100 shares at 800. The only way it's getting exercised is if the buyer forgets to sell and their broker did it automatically.  I only have around 8,500, so if I somehow have to deliver 200 shares at 800 each.... then I'm fucked. If everything works out I will increase my account value by around 10x, if not then I might $ROPE. It can't go tits up.

41,"If you're holding AMC because ""after covid, people will want to go back to the theaters "", you should reconsider.","A percentage of the population will want to go back to theaters for a movie, sure, but nowhere near the extent that some people here keep dreaming about.

For starters, we all know Hollywood fucking sucks right now. So many shitty reboots or sequels, lack of genuinely good films to bring people out. Even if you consider the movies that have some buzz like Dune or Marvel shit, the number of movies that's going to attract a wide audience is low.

Now, consider fhe fact that theaters have been rapidly declining in value for years, and yeah, covid didnt help that either. But even pre-covid amc was already around 7 a share, and with restrictions still currently in place, it seems obvious amc will continue to decline before it improves (meaning selling now and buying again later is the right move if you just really want to hold amc.

The fact of the matter is, the combination of too few good films, over priced concessions, increasing movie ticket prices, and the fact that the majority of people just aren't very interested in theaters anymore and the writing is on the wall for this stock.

It's honestly insane how many people keep repeating this idea that amc is going to explode or even rise significant once covid is over because people are desperate for the ""old days"". They mainly want to go to restaurants, clubs, and bars again. Even in the ""old days"" of pre covid, theaters were not extremely popular. That's not going to magically change. At best, a bump in traffic when restrictions are lifted then back to losing stock value.

It's obviously going to recover beyond it's current stock price. Even if it doesnt reach its previous highs it still a good gain to have on your books. 

Also remember you have an entire years worth of 2020 movies that never had a decent run at theaters before going digital. I guarentee you they will be re-released once things open.Does AMC have adult theatres yet? Serves booze.Overpriced concessions and increased ticket prices is good for the stockAnd if a merger happens all of this input becomes nil.what if AMC partners with Netflix to show Netflix exclusive movies in AMC theaters? would there be a market for that? I mean IMAX theaters have exclusive movie events, and Netflix makes movies with High-level Actors so could reel in a huge market... but just an idea.AMC must adapt if they want to survive, How do they not have a sports deal yet with anyone, Monday night football with a huge screen, beer and a bunch of apes cheering for the same team.  It's like going to the bar to watch but better everythingDisney literally releases 1 to 1 remakes of their animated movies and prints money with it. Sorry but that's bullshit. If there was any truth to what you wrote movies like Knives Out would have made a billion while shit like Aladdin would have made 100k in the Box office. 

That's not slightly the case tho.

Fast and Furious is probably one of the worst franchises out there but it prints money because especially cassual audiences go nuts for it.

People love to eat garbage, they want garbage and they will get garbage.

AMC will probably not explode but it will recover enough for someone to make profit when he buys the stock now.I am holding because i bought at $14 and will watch it go to $2 before i average down.You may be right, but for what it's worth the stock price is in the toilet right now. So if you bought higher what would be the point of selling now? you might as well hold on the off chance that it swings upward. Because there's not much further it can drop it at this pointRight now for me, the whole point is to HODL as you won't have to take any loss imo ..

> Here's my math. Global TV ad spending is approaching $180b a year. ROKU is currently in 10 percent of streamer homes. COVID has accelerated that money moving from traditional TV to streaming, so ROKU rev topping $15b a year is completely realistic. Whittle that down to $5b profit with a conservative one-third profit margin, it works out to $35 a share. Put a conservative 20x multiple on it, I feel really good about a $700 price target.

$15b revs is a lot but I think with the recent push of local TV advertising into OTT, it is totally realistic. Local TV stations are now all telling advertisers they are able to target specific viewers thanks to OTT data they get on the end user, they used to target the lowest common denominator when local TV was strictly broadcast, which is why local ads are usually all personal injury lawyer and workers' comp ads. They're getting higher quality, better paying advertisers because they can now promise precise end user targeting via ROKU.

I have one concern, however, Cathie Wood has been steadily selling her huge ROKU positions nearly every day for at least two weeks now. How do I know this? Because I am signed up for ARK's daily email updates. You should too at https://ark-funds.com/subscribe

I wonder what her thinking is. She might just be taking profits since her position is up huge in a short period of time. Or does she think this is it for ROKU. I have a Google News alert set for Cathie Wood and ROKU in case she ever comments publicly on it.The old gods have returned!Nicely done man. As a owner of TVs with ROKU built in; its def the future.

44,February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates,"For WSB noobs: pharma stocks usually jump or dive after binary (success/failure) events such as drug trial results coming out or FDA approvals.

The size of the move depends mainly on two things:

\- The market cap of the company: for a huge company like JNJ, any event will generate only a tiny move, whereas the value of a penny stock can +10x after a successful event.

\- Size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? The larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.

Drug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the FDA grants priority date to certain drugs. These are referred to as PDFDA events.

Here's a list of the ones (with market cap > 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:

I have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):

* 11 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Evinacumab (high cholesterol), addressable market: small
* 15 Feb 21 [$GTHX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GTHX) Trilaciclib (designed to improve outcomes of patients who receive chemotherapy), addressable market: large
* 25 Feb 21 [$SRPT](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SRPT) Casimersen (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), addressable market: small
* 28 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Libtayo (metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma), addressable market: small
* 28 Feb 21 [$BPMC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/BPMC) Pralsetinib (metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer), addressable market: small
* 28 Feb 21 [$ATNX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATNX) Oral Paclitaxel (metastatic breast cancer), addressable market: medium

My positions:

I have invested some money only in SRPT and ATNX. In SRPT, because it had a huge drop recently and I hope an approval will trigger a recovery. ATNX because I think the treatment being in the form of a pill is a winner. I haven't researched the rest.

Firstly, paclitaxel is a very strong drug, used in advanced cancer situations, also nearly always in combination with other drugs.

That said, his name is DEEPFUCKINGVALUE. He did DEEPFUCKINGVALUE plays, I'm talking warren buffet level 4-D chess lol.

He didnt chase trends. Or buy something because someone told him so. He was ruthless and logical in his belief that at the time, it was a very intelligent decision at the time.

46,A Gambler's Guide to GME. How to use Expected Value to Help Make Decisions.,"I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. If you are gambling with money that you need to survive, you are acting irresponsibly. I am doing this ONLY with the speculative part of my position (which is all of it, but still true) and this post is referring to that speculative portion.

The expected value (EV) is the anticipated value for an investment or speculation at some point in the future. You calculate all the positive outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence with the negative outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence and you will have your perceived expected value. If the number is negative, you are better off getting out and cutting losses. Gamblers win by making positive EV decisions, even if sometimes you have the nuts on the turn and then a fish flops a flush on the river.

Expected Value (EV) = ((Total Negative Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence)+(Total Positive Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence))

* If EV>0 HOLD! DO NOT FOLD! I might consider buying more with funds that I can stand to lose.
* If EV=0 Grey Area. You aren't really making a big mistake no matter what you do.
* If EV<0 Accept that you lost, time to cut losses and fold. If you are honestly here by your appraisal of the situation, sell. Yes, I said it.

With this speculative portion, the amount that you have already put in is a sunk cost, if you paid $420 a share or $5 a share, that amount is gone. We will only look at the price that it is today. For simplicity, let's say it's $60 right now.

So let's say I think that the lowest this stock can go is $30, due to favorable coverage and impressions among zoomers and millenials, who are the primary demographic, along with news of the new internet-savvy hires, the Chewy guy and all that.

So negative outcome of $60 to $30 represents a 50% drop. What's my target price? Let's say its  $1000, representing a gain from our example's current price of 1,566.67%. Likelihood that it hit's $30 before $1,000, idk, let's say I estimate a 95% chance of that happening first.

EV =(-50% loss from current level)(95% likelihood)+(1,566.67% gain)(5% likelihood)

EV=(-.5)(.95)+(15.6667)(.05)

EV=((-0.475)+(0.7833))=0.3833 (Expected EV is positive from our assumptions, I should HOLD!)

And the fabled $69,420? I'm not gonna write out the math on this, but it turns out that the perceived breakeven EV is with a 99.96% chance to fail versus 0.04% chance to succeed at this level. If I thought that the chance of this succeeding was greater than 0.04%, not 4%, 0.04%, I should at least HOLD my position.

“SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE!”

“YEEAHHH!” -Lloyd Christmas

**Now someone might tell me that my assumptions are wrong; that the drop is more or less likely than I presented or could be more (or less). That's fair. I might be wrong, but this is what I am looking at and the way I am looking at it. Do your own DD.** (edit: bolded this for all the retards that wanna fixate on the assumptions in my example. I used what I feel is a pessimistic likelihood for effect.)

Anyway, hope this puts things into perspective. The Hedge Funds want you to fold your hand at the lowest point possible, because that is positive EV for them. If you can afford to gamble (er, this is the stock market, so um, let's say speculate), these are things to think a bout.

TLDR: Based on assumptions of worst case scenarios and their estimated likelihood, along side current prices & target goals, you can make math-based decisions on whether you should sell or hold.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lff0y0/a_gamblers_guide_to_gme_how_to_use_expected_value/,"Instructions unclear.

Basically I have some assets that I need to liquidate to be able to get off Robinhood and I want to immediately reinvest that money. I want to use the ACH and routing numbers on my RH that correlate to my cash management account to make deposits on a different exchange without having to withdraw the money to my bank account. I already started trying to set it up and it requires that they make deposits to my RH and then let me verify the amounts. Does anyone have any idea if this will work or is it a wild goose chase???",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfenf4/serious_question_about_robinhood/,"Do NOT liquidate your positions on RH. Transfer your intact portfolio to another brokerage and liquidate on the second platform.Unfortunately it has become clear that RH is far from an acceptable platformI managed a 24 hour turnaround doing this myself instead of a brokerage transfer, which I hear can take awhile, but YMMV.

Sold my positions in RH, immediately withdrew the cash to my checking and savings account.  (For some reason they only let it go back to the account it came from without jumping through hoops).

Money was available the next day at 9 AM in both accounts.  Transfered that money to my existing Vanguard brokerage account, and was immediately able to trade all of it.  (I had one little hiccup today moving the last $5,000, called Vanguard and without any difficulty they flipped a switch and I was able to trade the rest).I switched to Fidelity investments old broker but very good customer service they answer your phone calls same day 👌Good luck! The week before the wild market, I had to liquidate my RH (closed end funds).  I couldn’t do any ACH transfers (1/17-19) even using RH money account number. Had to request a check which went NSF on first deposit on 1/28.I'm skeptical you got banned from the robinhood sub. It's not actually connected to robinhood and these types of questions were regularly asked there for years.I wish I had a dollar for every time I hear ""don't use RH"" the retards of retards on here know it's bad news. I hope you know they are loaning out your shares as well.You mean jerking off to Robin Hood ? Wickkeeedddim pretty sure its possible to transfer your holdings over to another platform or several. depending on what you've got invested and whether or not the new platform supports it.  
for example if i held GME with robinhood, i should be able to transfer what i hold, without selling, to the likes of etoro.  


&#x200B;

but im pretty dumb so i dunnoIts a legit way of doing it since the RH cash management account is basically a debit card.

I've had banks complete this process before and they deposit between 0.01 - 0.03$ and you tell them the correct amount. Now with RH all is fucking viable. Maybe they will withdraw 10mill since they can see its coming from another bank and they think its free money.

Good luck.",1612799489.0,21
48,"Why Clean energy is still the high IQ play in 2021. Solar, Hydrogen, Nuclear. DD Inside.","Why is energy still the play and why will it let you retire in the few years?

General: 
During a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with Covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. You can look back at the ‘08 ‘09 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after Michael Burry got famous. [1]
   
  

Next, we have the catalysts, Joe Biden. According to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. Biden will act quickly, and aggressively. He’s working with Congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put America on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. While also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. Not really lastly, but also make $400bn as ONE part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) All while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. This is within his “Biden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment” which also pertains to the auto industry such as EV gov vehicles, see WKHS as an example.[2][3]  
    

Energy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. It's too late! False. So has everything, even giants like Apple are up over 100% since March lows.   Clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.
  

Hydrogen: 
Recently Mercedes-Benz spins off it’s truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. While premium sedans have largely been adopting the EV mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. “..while the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] Recently Ballad power Systems $BLDP signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]

  

Nuclear::
Now, we have Solar, Wind, Hydrogen and what else? Well, reasonably speaking you also have Uranium to Nuclear energy. Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.     
  

Utilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. We also have Elon Musk talking about Nuclear Bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI [4][5]
  



# If I had to choose a single ticker from each, I would choose **$FCEL** for Hydrogen, **$NXE** for Nuclear, **$ENPH** for solar

The tides in energy have changed, we are seeing huge pushes globally to adopt these new technologies. If you rub your couple of brain cells together really hard, this shit is the future.    

Tickers: $FCEL, $BLDP, $PLUG, $NXE, $ENPH or if you want ETFs, $TAN, $FAN, $PBW (shout out to $ICLN gang) 
  
Final: This was way longer and harder than I anticipated to put together. We still have Energy Storage, Wind, and I didn’t even address Solar reasons, Biofuels or NatGas. But these are my big bets for 2021. I'm aware EV is beast, but so is everyone else, bringing new information to light that may be less represented. 
I'll do a part2: if you enjoy this expanding and adding extra details.

They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood.

  The WSB I subbed to is not the same as the WSB today, so for the newbies: GME NOK BB 🚀 💎 🚀. For everyone else:
  
  Within the global economy, there are several emerging markets. Asia, Africa, and Latin America have experienced and are on the cusp of unprecedented growth. Pretty much every industry is booming, but not every industry is easy to invest in. 
  
  The three fastest growing industries within these countries (mainly Brazil, North/ South Africa, SE Asia) are consumer products, infrastructure and development, and financial infrastructure. Consumer goods and development are extremely segmented industries; it would be almost impossible to dependably buy stocks that cover a large market share. However, due to corruption and ease of communication with foreign entities, the banking industries within these countries are fairly centralized. 
  
  The banks I have mainly been looking at are BDORY (Brazil), SGBLY (South Africa), IBN (India), among others. Most of these banks haven’t fully recovered from the initial coronavirus drop so if you’re like me, and think pretty much every US stock is overpriced, this could be the play for you. For consumer products, my play is Coca-Cola. These are long term plays so don’t expect 30% in two days. Of course, invest at your own risk.

This post is to offer a different perspective. Hopefully offering contrarian opinions is something that's still allowed on this sub.

1. You really don't feel that going from about $38 to more than $400 in a week is a short squeeze?
2. If you are one of those people that compares to VW, then...wouldn't Cohen joining the board be the catalyst? And, go look at the charts for yourself but instead of looking at screenshots here, ZOOM OUT on both charts. Looks like a short squeeze to me.
3. There was no evidence before GME of Robinhood having a desire to screw over retail investors. The CEO is a millenial...that's not their thing.
4. What there IS evidence of, is incompetence. Doesn't it seem more likely that the brokerage with a crayon interface that once allowed UNLIMITED FUCKING MARGIN simply didn't have the liquidity to handle something like this? And that the CEO is a fucking dumbass who didn't want to admit it on national tv?
5. Why would Citadel even need to pressure Robinhood to begin with? They could have easily seen this coming and prepared for it.
6. If you still believe Citadel was behind this, then RH isn't even the 'enemy' in this scenario anyway. It'd be the DTCC that ultimately made the decision to raise margins to 100%.
7. If you feel that Melvin was lying about covering their position when they actually didn't, then the silver lining is that this is blatant, obvious, and easily disproven. They ARE being investigated; So this would come out and it'd be a big fucking deal. Which makes me doubt they'd lie about something they have no ability to cover up.
8. You really should go look at other subs once in a while: Stocks, Stockmarket, Pennystocks, and Options. Contrarian opinions are allowed there. If nothing else, isn't more information before you make a financial decision a good thing?

Disclosure: I've had multiple positions on GME. Bought calls and puts, bought shares, sold covered calls using both shares and LEAPS as leverage. I made a lot of mistakes during the run, but have come out so far with about 150% profit (could have been over 1000% if I played it a lot better)",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfe7rn/robinhood_colluding_with_citadel_to_halt_buying/,">The CEO is a ~~millenial~~billionaire...that's ~~not~~ their thing.The thing is, all (potential) fines are just peanuts compared to potential lossesIf you add the gamma squeeze plus everyone running to GameStop after it being on the news. I wouldn’t count it as the short squeeze. Notice how it died as soon as all the restrictions came. Don’t get me wrong I’m a bag holder I know there’s more downside before upside but still the squeeze hasn’t happened yet. They’ve fucked w the calculation and DFV is gonna destroy Melvin in court.Incompetence, lack of awareness and lack of capital. Vlad admitted on TV that he/RH don’t compute their own clearing house deposit - they just wait for NSCC to tell them what it is. Big Wall Street brokerages have apps and people monitoring their risk real time so at the close they know what their requirement is for the next say and have time to arrange funding if necessary.Nobody wants to accept the fact that dtc raised collateral prices to 100%They colluded for sure. If companies have liquidity problems, they should have affected their buying power of all stocks. If people come to you to buy bread and stop buying milk, make more bread. Who discontinues making bread?

Put a warning in your app saying due to demand with highly volatile stocks, the app is experiencing technical issues. 

And to add, majority of customers on Robinhood don’t even have margin accounts....you're right but the bagholders are gonna be mad and say you're wrongIt doesn't really matter why it happened.

I've tried to explain this several times to people on here and they just don't get it.

Since the GME hype has calmed down a bit, I present you with my first DD on this forum.

First of all, no financial analyst here. This is no investment advice and do your own research.

I will take you trough each step in my DD. Sorry for the long post, but I want to have a discussion with you on my DD, possible flaws in my research etc. Therefore, I will post everything I do.

**Okay here we go:**

I have a background in economics. Since the market nowadays is quite high, I am trying to analyze every investment I make thoroughly to minimize the risks. After November last year it was quite easy to make a return on investment. However, we have increased a lot and I feel the urge to deep dive in every company I invest in.

**Step 0, find an interesting company to analyze.**

What my ritual is, is to analyze the list of next week’s earnings. I analyze every company on the list, think about possible market conditions which have changed in favor or disfavor for the company, read news articles, and look at the earnings.

While doing this, me and my team have picked Enphase Energy.

**Step 1, look at the previous realized EPS and Revenue vs. forecasted EPS and Revenue:**

54,Ubiquiti – UI – Momentum stock with Potential Short Squeeze or Leveraged Buyout,"Ubiquiti Inc. develops networking technology for service providers, enterprises, and consumers.

On 2/5/2021 Ubiquiti announced another quarter that exceeded expectations with strong global demand for their products. The growth/adoption of their products into the enterprise demonstrate that the company continues to gain traction against the likes of Cisco (CSCO).

For those that read a headline and act: A couple of items to be aware of.

1. While the stock has a 20.8B market cap, it only trades a little over 100k shares a day or about 1.5% of the available float. This means using limit orders when buying or selling might be best. Otherwise the MM’s will take advantage of you.
2. The liquidity/spreads in the option market are horrible. Outright buying the stock is likely the way to play this stock

**A Little Background**

Ubiquiti was founded by Robert Pera and went public in 2011. This is the same Robert Pera that owns the Memphis Grizzlies. I like to think of him in the same light as Mark Cuban. He is a disruptor by nature and has an anti-establishment approach. He is not always conventional in his methods when engaging with the media and public which likely results in less overall hype around Ubiquiti.

As of 12/31/2020 there were 62.8m shares outstanding. Founder Robert Pera owns 56.2m shares or 89.6% of the company.

The company has been aggressively buying back shares, reducing the shares outstanding by over 2m in 2020. As of 12/31/20 they still had $385.2m authorized under the “2020 May Program” which facilitates the company’s repurchase program.

According to [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/), institutions own 6.9m shares, resulting in over 100% ownership between Pera and institutions. Some percentage of these institutions represent index funds that are not actively managed. The institutional ownership may be overstated as a result of stale data and/or the company’s repurchase of 309,133 shares in the last 3 months of 2020.

Then there are the retail investors that own some small slice of this company. Some of the retail investors are self-declared Ubiquiti “Fan Boys” such as myself that have owned the stock for years and have deployed their equipment in our homes and across the enterprise’s where we work.

The end result is a float of 6.5m shares of which some percentage that is owned by index funds or owned by “Fan Boys” and not actively traded.

The company just declared another $0.40 dividend. With $1.60 in anticipated dividends over the next 12 months, Pera will be taking home an estimated $90m per year in dividends. Why is this relevant? Pera is is able to generate cash from his Ubiquiti ownership, without the need of selling shares. He just holds his current shares while increasing his ownership percentage through the company’s stock repurchase program.

**Now for the Shorts**

As of 1/15/21 there were 1.04m shares short which represents 15.94% of the float. We will have to see how these change when the 1/31 numbers are released this week. The low daily average volume results in a Short ratio of 10.38 as calculated by Yahoo finance as of 1/15.

With a great quarter behind them, a growing business, fewer COVID-19 related supply chain risks and combined with insiders who generally do not sell, where will the shorts get shares to cover their bets if the stock continues to move against them?

Pera has not shown a desire to sell.Mid-Cap index funds are not actively managed.“Fan Boys” are not selling anytime soon.The Company continues to repurchase shares.

I believe short covering could result in a monumental short squeeze if the stocks momentum continues an upward trajectory.

**Why not a leveraged Buy-out**

Now I am certainly not an expert on leveraged buy-out’s, but what would it take for Pera to decide to take the whole thing private. Like Michael Dell taking his namesake company private in 2013 before going public again in 2018.

The company is generating great cash flow, actively reducing the number of shares available and is predominantly owned by a multi-billionaire.

With $385.2m still available to repurchase shares, at a current market price of $330, this could remove another 1.16m shares from the float, making it that much easier to buy-out the company.

Is the stock repurchase program a precursor to something bigger?

**Conclusion**

You could conclude this continues to be a growth story of a company looking to disrupt the status quo. They are profitable, growing, pay a dividend and demonstrated good cash flow all the while repurchasing their stock.

This could be a massive, short squeeze in the making as the short ratio is 10.38 and float continues to be reduced as a result of the share repurchase program.

The endgame could be a leveraged buy-out that sees Ubiquiti taken private resulting in a handsome reward for Pera’s loyal followers.

I Love Ubiquiti’s products and this stock.

I have been long since 5/22/2014 and have added to my position as recently as 2/5/21

Edit1: Clarification based on a comment. Leveraged Buyout may be the incorrect term for my thought process. I intended to imply that Pera could just take the company private as he owns a significant percentage of the outstanding shares and is reducing the percentage he does not own through the stock repurchase program.

55,The game is rigged but 💎✊✊✊ can still win!,"Disclaimer: I'm not a professional in this field. This is not financial advice. I'm not even owning GME or any stocks for that matter but I'm fascinated by this corrupt casino called stock market.

For every GME stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a GME stock becomes available for borrowing. We can pump GME forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. They know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. They are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. And even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.

There are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:

* Pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. If you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this ""insane""? $5k? $50k?
* GME steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.

People own twice as many stocks than there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have GME. Twice. Just to get out of this bet.

I think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without GME taking action. With GME taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.

62,Hedge Funds Are A Symptom - ADDRESS THE CAUSE,"
Hate Hedge Funds & Wall Street - Why Not End Them All?

With so many users on WSB, there are many point of views about Wall Street and the market.  However, it seems to me the majority of the community dislikes Hedge Funds and the big players who have trampled over retail investors to make a living.  

Considering the current economic environment, it's more imperative than ever to be ""invested"" in the stock market. The problem is the financial system and Wall Street ultimately benefits from the growing amount of investors.  Even when retail outperforms hedge funds or manages to achieve trades like $GME, it eventually works in their benefit.  The value of assets increasing allows higher returns, speculation, and the securitization of these assets(& rehypothecation) to use for financial gain.  

The Financial system has changed ever since 71s departure of the Gold Standard(which had problems due to Bretton Woods) and 1977 amendment of the Federal Reserve Act.  Ever since then you can see interest rates have trended in down for 40 years now - this is because the Federal Reserve's mandate of ""maximum employment"" causes Fed to stop recessions with lowering interest rates which to incentivize debt/consumption.  Ever since the beginning of the 80s community banks have been annihilated due to monetary policy, its structure, and Congress.  Wealth inequality just so happens to start it's trend upwards, favoring the 1%(really the.1%), and corporations shift board compensation from salary to stock/option compensation; corporations have also increased share buybacks and dividends as a % of profits too.  Again, this is caused by monetary policy and it rewarding speculation and short term invesments over long term(capex/wages).  This structure/policy is also why private equity went on a boom in the 90s and continued ever since.  If you examine corporate bankruptcies from private equity their % is more than double the average.  Pestakeholder.org has a report titled Pirate equity or something along those lines and they tracked retail employment for from 2007-17 or a time frame close, and in 10 years the retail sector had added over 1 million jobs while retail owned by private equity had ""suffered"" almost 600k job losses! 

The monetary system is how the financial sector and big banks control our economy.  They have more power than Congress and literally direct how capital flows and which sectors thrive or die.  The Federal Reserve is just an extension of Wall Street - the NYFED is a corporation with a board that is mostly bank CEOs or members of their board.  These people are responsible for bank supervision...  

I saw a popular post on here about a guy holding his $GME position.. It was titled: ""This is for you, Dad"". They were holding their position just to inflict any pain and losses possible on hedge funds.  Their explanation for this was the housing crisis and how it caused his dad to lose his business and a lot more, all while these funds were bailed out and their livelihoods unaffected by a crisis they helped create.  Unfortunately, his reasoning doesn't address the real culprit that caused his father's and families pain.. Along with millions of Americans.  

The Federal Reserve has created an economy for the Big Banks and their control - assets have literally only grown at big banks(mostly big four/six).  In fact, the Office of the comptroller of the currency quarterly report will show you FOUR banks control 155 TRILLION of the derivative market while ALL OTHER BANKS control 23 trillion.  

The 800 billion bailout for banks has been mentioned as well... Try 16 trillion(Google GAO audit) or 29 trillion(Link below) if we include currency swaps(which were for other countries not the banks).  The Fed created emergency facilties to specifically bailout banks and AIG.  These emergency facilties were managed by... WALL STREET.  In fact, 8 out of 10 of the highest paid contracts to manage facilities with taxpayer money to bailout themselves were given ""non-competitively"" - usually gov contracts have to provide a fair auction so they can't favor companies over another.  The Fed can just say these are ""unusual and exigent circumstances"" to bypass that.  They paid Blackrock over 100 million to help manage these facilties.  I think PIMCO was over 100 million too.  Then BofA and other banks were paid tens of millions as well.  The banks literally were involved in bailing out themselves.  They received trillions in lending by the Fed - Citigroup had the highest total at 2.6 trillion.  They literally had their toxic debt offloaded onto the Feds balance sheet.  It took the Fed 10 years to unload all of their ""Maiden Lane"" MBS purchases.  

Present day they bailed out banks in 2019 - before covid - with repo operations. 

From Wallstreetonparade.com 
""If the Fed had wanted the public to clearly understand that its repo loans were ongoing but had simply gone dark, it could have printed a statement to that effect on the daily page it posted showing zeros going out in repo loans.

“Beginning with this month’s release, the Desk will no longer publish daily updates with the next business day’s operational details.”


The Fed's cumulative loans from Sep 2019 to mid March 2020 totaled over 9 trillion.  Half way into 2020 they stopped publishing.  However, as WSOP points out from the F-SOC the big banks are currently using 2.5 trillion of loans.  These are typically overnight or a few days. 

None of this is transparent because the NYFED is a corporation and is not subjected to FOIA - The board of Fed is but I tried getting records on the emergency facilties and they stated they do not have these records because the NYFED conducts the lending and facilties.  So, the trillions of bailouts in 2008-10 and in 2019 and 2020 are literally at a corporation and not the agency(Board) of government.  




Alright, I could go on for another 100 pages quite literally.. Let's get to the point.  

The only way to beat this system is to stop using it - practically impossible.  The only way to achieve that is to stop using Dollars... Also practically impossible.  However, a huge impact to the system would be to not hold any savings or any large holdings of dollars the banks.  It's imperative.  Investing in anything outside of dollars, debt in dollars, and any investments is necessary - holding savings in metals is one and there are many others(dig c) could actually inflict major problems IF many people actually committed to this.  If a few percent of Americans did this the banks would have huge problems.  

Nothing is going to change until we address the Federal Reserve.  Anything less is just a *game that won't *stop the pillaging of avg Americans from this industry.  

Didn't proofread sorry if there are many typos.

64,Fintel's constantly changing stats for AMC,"I've been following fintel's reports for quite some time - way before I knew about AMC and GME.

Their reports have been quite accurate, but recently I've been noticing some shady activity that has made me raise an eyebrow.

To preface, I am usually not a conspiracy person myself. Even with all the weird movements this past week, I would not like to shout ""market manipulation"" until I'm completely sure there's something going on. Ironically, all this shady changes have been happening right before dissemination day (02/09/2021).

The first one I would like to point one is the one that makes the most sense to me:

My screenshot (02/05/2021):

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/gwr0w2lvc9g61.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=392713765e7e5e6c8cec78f82f99d3392fae8537](https://preview.redd.it/gwr0w2lvc9g61.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=392713765e7e5e6c8cec78f82f99d3392fae8537)

Current report (02/08/2021):

[https://preview.redd.it/hvnht9yhc9g61.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab31267f7f33bdc74c9699772479fd76eb75165](https://preview.redd.it/hvnht9yhc9g61.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab31267f7f33bdc74c9699772479fd76eb75165)

The short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). The second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image - i.e. the current report on Fintel. For the first drop, unfortunately, I don't have an image to prove it. But, what I do remember is that for the 3rd of February the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.

Regardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. This one I'm willing to blame on ""updating data"".

I presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.

However, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often Fintel updates their stats. My screenshot was on the 5th of Feb, and the current one (8th of Feb). This shows that Fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.

Right, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.

My screenshot (02/06/2021):

&#x200B;

As you can see the first screenshot I had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in February compared to prior months. This was after the first correction that I had mentioned previously (the one I don't have a screenshot for).

In April of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it's showing it to be above 85%. And February of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.

I get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. But for historical data? Especially with such a huge change? And all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?

There was a person on Stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to Fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.

Here's the email he received.

Again, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. But all of this seems like more than a coincidence.

Thoughts.

P.S I'm not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn't like what he sees.

P.S.P.S I'm still holding strong!

Edit: A lot of people were asking what does this mean. It doesn't mean anything per se. It just shows that there is some odd movement happening with Fintel's platform. One of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with Fintel:

""Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern! You are right. Given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. Given this, we have revised some historical numbers. We announced this in the Welcome Group and on those pages. Sorry the message wasn’t up for longer - I imagine that was super confusing. We will replace it again. I imagine many subscribers did get to see it.

Are you certain the chart isn’t updating? That is an automated process. I appreciate you writing in so I could clarify. I’ll resolve your ticket but I’m still here if you reply.""

I mean, this is possible. However, why now? Why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say ""oh yeah, let's update these statistics so we can show more ""accurate"" measurements to our users"". Ya know?

**Also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: Borrowing fees for AMC went up by 1% (currently sitting at 4.47% from the previous 3.5%. Usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.**

**Edit X2:** A fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the r/RubinoffButtChug69 made a similar speculation.

65,TDC 5x immediate upside,"Hey Lads, I've been lurking on here since 2016, and today I bring you TDC.

I think Teradata (TDC) has 5x immediate upside. I could post some more in-depth DD, but I 'm trying to get this idea posted before market open so anyone who wants to can get in before the massive ripper. I think the following cuts to the chase

I was lucky enough to pitch this shitco to an investment club in college back in 2014. At the time, TDC was being disrupted by Hadoop/the cloud and all signs pointed to the slow death of this legacy data warehousing business. My idea was basically laughed off the floor and the club didn't buy, and honestly I couldn't blame them in hindsight. I followed this business for the next 7 years and saw it ripped 30% last week, and is now up 11% in premarket.

Apparently, TDC has managed to launch a cloud-based data warehousing alternative to Snowflake. This business segment just achieved $100 million in annual recurring cloud-based revenues, with yoy growth of 100%+. This compares to Snowflakes \~$400 million, which is also growing at triple digits. I would say that TDC is a pretty serious competitive threat to SNOW at this size.

SNOW is valued at 175x sales (\~90 billion market cap), and TDC is valued at 1.6x sales ($3 billion market cap). If you were to slap a 170x revenue multiple on TDC's emerging cloud business, it would be worth $17 billion, up from $3 billion this morning.

TDC has about 20% short interest just received a buy rating from BofA. The squeeze has already started and the stock is up  37% on the week, but I believe we are in the early innings of a 500% ripper. Major sellside analysts are starting to upgrade the stock.

Unlike GME, which is a dinosaur facing two asteroids (death of the mall, death of physical game discs) TDC is a recovering shitco with an extremely attractive cloud business that is going to compete directly with SNOW. There are some very attractive quality underpinnings to this trade - i.e. this isn't a pump and dump, it's a classic turnaround that could rip past $100 this month.

I'm buying weeklies on open, see you fellas on the moon

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

edit\* will post more DD later

Recent [earnings release](https://s23.q4cdn.com/501457330/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/TDC-4Q20-Earnings-Release-(1).pdf) for anyone interested. TLDR; cloud annual recurring revenues were up 100% in 2020, guidance suggests 165% growth in Q1 2021 and 100% growth for FY 2021. Strong results, and sell-side is catching on. This isn't just some short squeeze. 

&#x200B;

[TDC hasn't gone anywhere for years. stock is underappreciated](https://preview.redd.it/z14tzjwcf9g61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b38d5e1f2736dd98e9eea9d889dcf50e36a6757)",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfcgn2/tdc_5x_immediate_upside/,"To clarify, this isn't really a short squeeze idea. That's just icing on the cake my dudes. This is a turnaround and I don't expect it to temporarily rip, it's going to get a permanent valuation re-rating.Whats wrong with this DD?

# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November

> * Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday’s open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average’s closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow’s gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and U.S. businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday’s 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer’s stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday’s premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year

> * The U.S. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.

*****

> # 3. Trump impeachment trial starts this week

> * Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump’s harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as “very unlikely.” Trump’s unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.

*****

> # 4. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine

> * South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca’s vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the U.S., AstraZeneca’s vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA. One from Johnson & Johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agency’s vaccine advisory committee.

70,The emerging agricultural LED tech market,"Grow light technology is rapidly evolving beyond simply growing plants indoors with the prevalent ""full spectrum"" marketing slogan. There are many specially tuned light type arrays and intervals, which effect everything from livestock behavior/growth speed and the color/taste of produce.

There's a major growth opportunity with this tech, coupled with emerging environmental and sociopolitical climates, such as:

* Climate change is shifting the tropical rain belts in the Eastern hemisphere (Europe/Asia) more northern per the recent [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00963-x): where there's less sunlight on average, forcing LED adoption to offset crop loss from shorter days, particularly in subarctic regions.
* Climate instability: with flooding, drought, etc. climate patterns becoming harder to predict, both livestock and plant growth need moderately reliable patterning to accurately meet future agricultural output goals and projections.
* There's a growing demand for stable food security and production across Asia, as a matter of national security, especially in the wake of pandemic food supply chain disruptions.

Plants and livestock both benefit from specifically tuned LED color combos, which effect growth speeds, enhanced flavors, etc. and where a few companies are now innovating.

Additionally as user **PhotoMacro1** states:

>PhD in plant science here. Another big source of revenue will be using Red and Blue LED light post harvest. Even in grocery stores.

This snippet from the Everlight Electronics [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everlight_Electronics) is pretty good TLDR of the space:

>In 2019, Everlight's newly formed optoelectronic R&D team introduced tunable LEDs to maximize animal husbandry and aquaculture.  
>  
>For instance in poultry farming, exposing a chicken to white light takes 172 days to reach reproductive maturity, while exposing to red light reduces to 168 days, but blue light increases maturity to 182 days. Green light exposure makes poultry gain weight faster, due to growth hormone receptor stimulation and enhancement of satellite glial cells which promote muscle development.  
>  
>The R&D team also introduced UV LEDs for eggshell surface sanitization and water disinfection for waste water runoff. In collaboration with Dr. Kun-Hsien Tsai, Professor at College of Public Health at National Taiwan University, a novel ovitrap was introduced which pulses Ultraviolet C to regularly destroy collected mosquito eggs.  
>  
>In 2020, Everlight collaborated with Professor Wang Yong-song’s team of the Institute of Fisheries Science, National Taiwan University to develop a special LED lamp for grouper fish aquaculture, where specific wavelength exposure reduces cannibalization and loss of fingerlings by over 40%.  
>  
>In 2021, Everlight released new horticultural LEDs in spectrums tailored to augment the red pigment of strawberries. Strawberries rely on sunlight to produce their red color through a process called anthocyanin biosynthesis, but in areas with little sunlight horticultural LEDs can be used to catalyze this biochemical process instead.

Major players (public companies):

* [Everlight Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everlight_Electronics) (Taiwan)
* [Osram](https://www.osram.com/os/applications/horticulture-lighting/index.jsp) (Germany)
* [Signify](https://www.signify.com/en-us) – formerly Philips (Amsterdam)
* [Cree](https://www.cree.com/led-components/)  – LED division recently acquired by SMART Global Holdings (United States)

Major players (private companies):

* Valoya
* Lumigrow
* Illumitex

For more context, [this article](https://www.hortidaily.com/article/9228810/an-introduction-to-far-red-light/) details more on one area of emerging research into far-red LED light for plant development.

I work in the industry. 

&#x200B;

Everyone is drooling over LEDs. They are a potentially awesome solution, but 1) there is still a lot of research to do on what wavelenghts and applications will give the growers a true advantage 2) how the energy landscape will make using LEDs or not business sense for the grower 3) the cost of the LEDs still make them unprofitable at least under commercial greenhouse conditions. 

&#x200B;

Plus the market will be rapidly commoditized which makes my inexperienced ass hard to decide where to put the money. 

&#x200B;

I am more interested in the potential application of LEDs in water treatment. Less number of players, harder market accessibility for companies and a lot of money going around. Whoever can come up and convince utilities and water treatment companies to adopt LED - based water treatment tech, that's probably where I would put some money on. This is also interesting because proving the viability of LEDs for the application happens much faster than vegetable growing trials.I’ve heard of this before. It hangs from the ceiling and allows you to see the book you’re reading even when it’s nighttime.Oh my gourd, that is some valuable information.Do they improve yield of gourd plantations?Find good shareholder return

I am in agricultural lighting and LED is two whole generations of lighting technology behind where we are at today.

71,Weekly Stock Market News🚀 | GOOG / AMZN / PINS / SQ / PYPL / COST & other Stock Market News [02-08]🚀,"**The stock market finished a terrific week at record highs🚀🚀🚀 Companies like Google, Pinterest, Amazon & others smash earnings reports while Jeff Bezos bows out🚀🚀🚀 Let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the week with big gains with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite finishing at new record highs while the Dow Jones did also rise for 5 straight sessions. For the week the [DOW](https://imgur.com/NQpg47q) gained 3.9%, the [SP500](https://imgur.com/cY3wx9N) rose by 4.65% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/T5qgyg5) outperformed gaining just over 6% in what was the best week since early November 🚀🚀🚀

The Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/Ki1RNHZ) dropped every day last week as it now seats just above 20, with this being a huge level that hasn’t been broken in a long while.

We saw all 11 [SECTORS](https://imgur.com/pp8DYTh) finish the week in the green, with Energy leading the way followed by Consumer Discretionary, Communications & Financials also gaining more than 6% 🚀

[Here](https://imgur.com/tRRK4fZ) is the HEAT MAP from last week, as we saw a hole lot of green in pretty much every sector, with big tech names gaining huge while the biggest lagging sector was Health Care. The big tech names just continue to [increase](https://imgur.com/96Q4J9w) their % of the SP market cap as technology is likely to continue to be one of the best performers in the next decades.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as manufacturing continue to recover in January as both the [ISM](https://imgur.com/Q9ZPnxF) index and the [PMI](https://imgur.com/nVz0oDe) Index came in pretty solid and continued to stand in expansion territory.

Also, the [ISM](https://imgur.com/jgJ2IbI) Services Index came in better-than-expected rising above expectations due to an increase in employment & new orders.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw [ADP](https://imgur.com/a39dqcB) coming in way better than expected as over 170K jobs were added after a big drop in December. We also saw initial jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/ftMXubP) dropping even more than expected while the continuing jobless claims fell to under 4.6M last week.

This [WEEK](https://imgur.com/vLr3QHG) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with core CPI, Consumer indexes and jobless numbers being the biggest ones while the [EARNINGS](https://imgur.com/PMP5olx) season continues with some of the most interesting earnings coming from Twitter, Coca-Cola, GM, Uber & PepsiCo while we also have to see how Disney subscriber numbers are continuing to evolve after hugely upgrading their expectations. One other thing that I am also interested to watch is the PayPal investors day on Thursday in which they are expected to provide a 3-to-5-year financial outlook.

In some other stock market [news](https://imgur.com/EcqHtMU), it seems that most of the RBNHD retail investors that have jumped ship are going to Square’s Cash APP with almost 40% of investors choosing the app. We have to see if this trend continues now, after [RBNHD](https://imgur.com/joQIln0) removed limits on all stocks, but regardless, I think Square is a nice FinTech play despite their huge valuation right now, as they will also benefit from the jump in digital currencies and more companies planning to increase investments in integrated POS providers just like Square 🚀

We also had a lot of interesting earnings last week with Amazon [crushing](https://imgur.com/GILwN3r) expectations, beating by almost $7 and almost $6B on revenues as this was the first time Amazon passed the $100B mark in a quarter as the holiday & e-commerce demand combined to give Amazon a 44% increase y/y in sales. The other big [thing](https://imgur.com/WMmAddL) we got from Amazon was that Bezos will step down as CEO as Andy Jassy the current AWS leader will become the next CEO. This news caused some uncertainty for the company, but I believe this is still a long-term buying opportunity as Amazon will remain one of the best companies to own in the world 🚀

Also, one of the biggest fintech companies out there, [PayPal](https://imgur.com/Klv5tD6) showed great strength in their numbers, beating both the top & bottom line as their total payment volume and new active accounts showed continued strength in the move to more & more online payments solutions 🚀

The other big earnings report we saw last week was from [Alphabet](https://imgur.com/5BOUPT0), which also beat by more than $6 and $4B in revenues as they surprised most of the analysts with great beats in most of the segments as their operating margin came in 5% better than expected. The biggest income generator remained the Search & YouTube business as they are still investing huge in their Cloud platform that is still bleeding money, but is very likely to pay out in the long-run 🚀

Other companies also smashed earnings with [Pinterest](https://imgur.com/0zB9SPh) beating expectations after a 76% revenue growth and a 37% user growth while [Ford](https://imgur.com/zerclC2), which was expected to post a loss, turned out positive earnings of $0.43 despite a 9% decrease y/y in total revenues, as the last 2 quarters of the year provided strong evidence that Ford is progressing into turning around the company🚀🚀

Meanwhile, though they didn’t have an earnings report, [COSTCO](https://imgur.com/6UmGJ7x) reported a rise in sales of almost 18% in January as the total comparable same store sales which rose by 15.9% crushed the analyst expectations of just 11.7%. I believe Costco is one of the best retailers to own despite it trading always at a premium, as the company is also jumping on the e-commerce trend, with a 107% increase in e-commerce sales in January🚀

And finally, let’s hope for a good day as the [world](https://imgur.com/itl9KxB) stock markets and the US [Futures](https://imgur.com/mlrfLz5) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way after the Treasury Secretary [pushed](https://imgur.com/jfKvaev) for more fiscal aid to help the economy & the unemployment fully recover as fast as possible.

73,"Discussion: Logically, GME short interest in the FINRA report should disappoint","**Disclaimer: I am not an experienced trader and this is not financial advice. I'm looking for a (serious) discussion and you're more than welcome to prove my logic wrong.**

The much anticipated FINRA report is published tomorrow after market closes. We're still in the dark about actual numbers for short positions, and we don't know much about what the hedge funds are up to. However, the way I see it based on what we've witnessed so far, their main strategy is one  of these two:

Case 1 - heavy manipulation of the data and the stock itself. If they chose to employ this strategy, they've most likely deemed the potential cost of fines/lawsuits more manageable than the losses from an uncontrolled short squeeze. If this is the case the numbers we've been given are manipulated or straight up false and the majority of shorts have not been covered. Their survival relies on retail investors selling due to FUD. All of this falls apart if FINRA reports a high short interest  tomorrow. Their only reasonable option in this case is to keep lying; the FINRA report will show a low short interest.

Case 2 - they're already covering their shorts one way or another. If this is the case the hedge funds have been more honest than most of us give them credit for. The estimates for the short interest have had a strong trend downwards, and if the estimates are accurate the squeeze has probably been squoze. It went down from more than 100% to 50% in a matter of days and I wouldn't doubt that it'll be even lower when the report comes. In other words, even in this case the FINRA report will show a low short interest.

Even if reality is some mix between both cases, there is in my mind no way they'll report a high short interest tomorrow. Otherwise everyone will jump back in and we'll at least get a repeat of what happened 2 weeks ago (peaking at \~490). Essentially, if the FINRA report comes with low short interest all paper hands will have sell orders ready for when market opens. The hedge funds will certainly make use of that opportunity.

TLDR: FINRA report bad, stock collapses (possibly momentarily) on Wednesday.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfa1vf/discussion_logically_gme_short_interest_in_the/,"if your company is bout to belly under what is 1B fine versus 40B????  wait it out... synthetic longs in play.... this is shit u cant make up, hell SEC may even help protect them from a gigantic bubble burst....Deep ITM calls 2 years out tell me they’re trying to play us.Finra's report can also show distorted results, there's no reason for this whole thing to collapse under brokers false short reports to finra. Also don't forget that the report is reporting 15 - 29 Jan shorts. Doesn't give much info about the 30'th and beyond.

tldr: Believe nothing, hold, wait.At this point, us retail can only hope that the other side (long, sharks, bulls, whales etc.) call out the bullshit with heavy buys and THEN retail gets the idea that short interest is not what it seems.

The first ""squeeze"" was done mainly by these market makers, who bought heavily after hours and pre market, if you remember two weeks ago. Also, what will be a BAD number? Something below 50%? 80%? Who knows.

All I can say is HOLD. I firmly believe this is not close to over, especially when they send bots after you, all of which tell you to sell.Post your SI guesses here:

227% why not.I'm hoping for big numbers but expecting a crash.

If it crashes I hope it *really* crashes and I can average down for cheap.Nomura recently got fined a mere $500,000 for falsifying their short interest in a FINRA report, so I wouldn't be surprised if this happens again. However, the hedge funds that might still be short can afford the fines, can you all afford to keep buying and the opportunity cost of holding for some misguided idea that somehow you're hurting wall street

78,DD: Why Gamestop GME is worth $1000 without a squeeze,"A little background first.  Gamestop was heavily shorted last year as hedge funds though it was a dying company.  

However in September Ryan Cohen who is the largest individual hold of Apple stock and founder of hugely profitable digital per food company Chewy started buy huge chunks of GME stock and indicating he was going to turn the company from brick and mortar retailer to a profitable online gaming juggernaut.

Also Michael Burry of The Big Short fame sent a letter to the GME board 
https://www.marketfolly.com/2019/08/dr-michael-burry-long-gamestop-sends.html

Once WSB got hold of this we saw the huge inflows of retail traders which pushed the price to $480 before buying was restricted culling the potential short squeeze.

Now Gamestop's price to sales ratio (P/S Ration) is currently less than 1. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/price-sales
(Market Cap $4.4BN /Annual revenue ~$7BN).

This seems fine for a dying brick and mortar but if the company becomes profitable (likely in next earning report in March) and starts to transform into a tech digital platform for gaming (likely as e AWS exec hired as CTO) it's P/S ratio will start rising to match other tech companies.

Square (SQ) for example has a P/S ratio of 14+ https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SQ/square/price-sales.

If GME had a similar P/S ratio (after the above happens) the share price would be well above $1000 per share.

Also remember the market is forward looking so if it seems signs of profitability and transformation then it will head to that valuation well before the process is complete.

* I am not a financial advisor and this is not advice, this is my personal opinion only.

Edit: Thanks for all the awards folks.  Ignore the bots and shills with ""this is retarded"" comments with no counter arguments. Why would they make comments like this, they must be scared.

Edit 2: This is an update for those who have a hard time understanding my post.  I'll dumb it down a bit for you guys with eh limited IQ's.

Tech companies are valued at higher multiples than brick and mortar stores.  The new Gamestop board is looking to transform it into a tech business.  See Tesla vs legacy auto and the difference in multiples there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf9hby/dd_why_gamestop_gme_is_worth_1000_without_a/,"TLDR: if GME were a different company, with a different business model, and Wall Street analysts valued it as such it would be worth soooooo much more.So if the market just prices GME like a tech company it's worth more?

79,The Path to the Moon,"**The Path to the Moon** is beset on either side by Jackals. 

Where once I was fooled, I thought the **Jackals** were only on one side, I now see many who have left the path to join with the other Jackals. Stray from the narrow path to the moon and **get eaten**. The Jackals are always hungry and don't understand why, they will say anything for a meal, anything for you to come and join them, **in their misery**. 

The **Path to the Moon** has many twists and turns, Ups and Downs, it is important to remember this is an **energy flow at work**. As energy travels from A to B it passes through many positions and it is wise for you as any fish, to hold your desire, **hold your truth** and yours alone. Do not be fooled by the desires of the Jackals they do not know you, they do not have your interests at heart. **See your End** **clear when you have reached it**, their is no one else in this game but you. 

In truth it could actually be so much **easier, if we were one**. If there were no jackals. But this is the path we find ourselves on and a **hard truth** we must accept. I made a **little money** on my rocket to the moon but what I really gained from all of you I met on the path was **much wisdom**. I see that this little movement you guys made that could easily reshape the world, has quickly been turned by jackals into a **dark unfriendly path**. Much like the others before it. 

**Holding** onto that which **no longer serves you** does you no good. The jackals convinced you the bag was full, now you look and see that it is empty. Pesky jackals. If my right hand should bind me I would **cut it off** and be free and seek fresh opportunities, perhaps one day the flow might come around again, perhaps not.

80,$PCG (PG&E) - California Utilities DD,"**Position**: I purchased $PCG shares at $4.98/share and added to my position last week.  Also purchased $SRE and $EIX. 

**Summary**:

California utilities are undervalued ($SRE, $EIX, $PCG) and still down \~ 27% from pre-Covid levels.  I believe all are strong buys – I have positions across the board. $PCG is my most bullish. I believe it is a very cheap entry point for a company that has proven to be bulletproof to regulators/oversight.

PGE Emerged from Bankruptcy with $25.5 B settlement

PGE should be eligible to reinstate dividend in 2022. Cheap entry into a growth stock with an expected reissuance of dividend.

Wild fire risks are low in winter, spring and early summer. 2020 was actually a very intense fire season but CA utilities mostly came out unscathed due to public safety power shutoffs (PSPS).  

1) **CA Utilities Undervalued**  
 The real BRRRR are utilities. They print their own money by capital improvement deprecation based on rate cases. Due to the 2018 wildfires and subsequent PSPS, utilities are getting authorized by California and Federal regulators to do more capitalized projects than ever. What does this mean? Revenues are going to be higher than ever. In the case of PCG, they hit the sweet spot in ineffectiveness. Doing so bad not to go bankrupt, but bad enough to get all their projects authorized by the state to maximize revenue.   Again, the California Public Utility Commission authorized the highest general rate case ever. 

2) **Bankruptcy Settlement**  
 $PCG’s market cap is $23.54B and has an outstanding bankruptcy $25.5 B settlement as of June 2020. Why is this significant? For one, the optics of having a valuation larger than your settlement liability flip (due to a $5.4 billion and partial $1.35B obligation) with February 25th earnings (unless the stock goes down by 20%) but more importantly, the settlement was incredibly favorable to $PCG.  

$PCG will likely post their highest annual revenue ever. EVER—see item #1. This wouldn’t work in the real world (maybe banking in 2008), but in the California utility world, if you screw up you get more money. Fire happened 2018, 2017 $PCG had $17.14B in revenue. 2020 revenue might be as high as $18.71B. So likely 10% higher revenues two years after a colossal failure.  

This is why utilities are included in the Monopoly game. 

3) **Dividend and Leadership**  
 $PCG agreed to freeze their dividend until $6.2B in non-GAPP core earnings. This target can be met as soon as 2022—not much of a penalty all things considered especially with the cheap entry point for this stock (down 36% from pre-COVID, down 52% from post fire peak) 

Another settlement term was restructuring the entire leadership team. $PCG did that, and it’s not like they’re replacing Jason Garrett with Mike McCarthy. They got themselves someone with a proven record leading utilities in Patricia Pope, who signed a 5-year deal with PG&E starting January 4, 2021. She previously served as CEO for Consumer’s Energy which was known for safety. She’s also the first women to ever lead two Fortune 500 companies. This will be her first earnings call for PG&E. Her announcement caused a brief spike in the stock—I expect the same with her first earning call (particularly with the positive numbers). 

4) **Wildfires**  
 Why buy now? Wildfire season is officially over now that CA received a ton of rain. This should be reflected in the risk for all utilities, but hasn’t resolved yet. 2020 was a very long fire season that lasted deep into January 2021. With all the PSPS and redflag warnings, I was hesitant to pull the trigger until CA was in the clear. I also positioned my call options to align w/ the beginning of 2021 fire season for a higher ROI if my strike price comes in. So in the clear for wildfires + new CEO + high earnings—great entry point.

**Potential** **obstacles**

There are pending investigations into some 2020 wildfires. Regardless of culpability, a big chunk of this will be covered by wildfire safety fund and won’t be anywhere near the 2017/2018 fires.

Operation and Maintenance costs/regulatory fines. Most costs are not capitalized, but most utilities know how to work around the regulators to get everything capitalized. There’s always the potential for additional fines, but they’d be pretty inconsequential.

Biggest obstacle: Everyone hates PG&E—like hate hates them. But WSB seems to be cool with Martin Shkreli so there’s that.

**MOAT –**   
 Ultimate Moat. They are bulletproof and there’s no point of entry other than acquisition. They provide infrastructure to transport power. Battery storage, solar, wind, gas, nuke, etc. all still use the same grid to transport. With higher EV demands and increase investment in fire hardening measures revenues will continue to climb.

**WHY WSB?**

Get that Money! Buy the utility you hate. If you’re in PG&E territory, buy the utility you hate and are obligated to pay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf8e91/pcg_pge_california_utilities_dd/,"As a California resident and former weed grower, I gotta say, FUCK PG&E! 

As a stock gambler and guy who likes easy money, I’m hoping my $PCG calls pay my mortgage.You missed 2 big points!

1) PCG just sold some usage rights of their towers for cell providers for a cool $900 million. Possibly more to come (will massively help with debt).


2) PCG will be the very first company to use Palantir's Foundry software! Should do wonders to optimize their data and make the grid safer and more efficient.

Thanks for content and for the mod-mail to reach out when things didn't work properly.  Appreciate your patience.Just FYI, few years ago Pcg had a gas line explode and destroy 38 houses. 

People really, and I mean really fucking hate pg and e here.PG&E is also experimenting with long term solutions for solar energy and permanent reduction of wildfire risk. They are experimenting with installing batteries in residential homes to capture energy during the day and release at night - this would also reduce rolling blackouts etc.

And they're right! IT is the best ever, they have their products scaled to cover all the segments they're striving for. They've always been competitors to NVDA, Intel, Micron, and I'll even throw in Marvell another company I love. However, similar to GME's hold on the gaming shopping experience and console dominance, AMD has that same strength and capability being that they are powering the PS4 and Xbox, but more importantly the **PS4**!! I don't need to explain how the gaming industry has boomed, if ape need more look at **PENN** chart! Add in the fact, their highly highly profitable and beloved Radeon and Ryzen combo, like...

Fine, although its had multiple pullbacks and setbacks throughout the year I  believe NVDA earnings seems to be the catalyst where the big big explosion occurs throughout the whole sector. However, its going to be a slow rally till then. I encourage WSB to get in before its too late and you're questioning why all the autists decided to write their AMD DD after it jumped 10% !

I'm not a financial advisor, I just been like the stock, along with CRSR and i think the gaming industry is going to have a massive incoming cycle so its best to get on the rocket early. The market diversification has gotten a little sloppy with everything going with shorts, so AMD is just too underbought in reality, which leads to one usual explanation. **THE BOOMERS HAVE NOT BOUGHT IN AS MUCH AS THEY COULD YET**. Social media trading is only increasing and all it takes is one shift into seeing AMDs retard real life strength with their products and services and poof we'll be swimming in mint. I usually would say AMD is just an **options** play for me, but I actually recommend grabbing shares now as this is probably the highest floor you'll ever see a stock have. It would be dope to do more of these and hope this helps the culture moving forward... ya boy got the 9-5 tomorrow but dreams come first couldn't put enough rockets so comment them in for me so they can reach me in my slumber all the way in VALHALLA

from what I understand  the sub was  about making dumb bets off ridiculous dd posts and losing money it was never about a movement to take down HF's, orpumping dead stocks

DFV did the work & followed the stock for like 2 years & his bet paid off. the stock went from 8$ to frinking 450$, it might have been stopped from it hitting 800-1000$, due to the shit fuckery,  but it's done. that was the squeeze. if you missed the peak just stop, it's not gonna happen again.  going from 4$ to 450$ is insane, even the VW one you guys keep bringing up was just a 100% gain.  you should move on,

how about you shut upSerious talk: that was NOT the 'squeeze'. It was a (possibly *the*) peak, but a short squeeze is specifically the process of forcing the short sellers to buy at ridiculous prices, which they have not done. It may or may not still be coming, but I just wanted to point out the rampant misuse of the word 'squeeze'.RH app littered across WSB front page and censoring posts that brings up what they did #WSBCoup",1612772671.0,0
83,Reminder of what ACTUALLY happened with GME.,"All you people saying things like 'the squeeze happened, you missed it', 'don't gamble on stocks', 'the bagholders were the greedy ones', 'people with no experience trading shouldn't have bought gme', 'GME was a stupid play from the beginning', 'I was wrong to buy GME', 'I should have sold GME'. Are all talking complete fucking bullshit and are twisting the truth and recollection of what actually happened, in reality, for actual fact. I don't know if they are bots, people who missed out or bitter bag holders but they are just fucking dead wrong about what the GME play was attempting and came within a few hours of accomplishing. 

GME went from $40 to a peak of $483 within a WEEK. The biggest shorter got bailed out for $2.75BN because of how bad their position was. WSB was getting national fucking coverage. This sub went from 2 million to 8 million subscribers. There were 60 million shares shorted going into thursday and at its all time high, would have cost a staggering 29BN dollars to buy back less whatever they were shorted at and that is not even counting the price going up by doing so. 

So no the squeeze didn't fucking happen, no you weren't wrong for buying in at 200 or 300 or even 400. The play worked and it got within hours of paying out. 

I know this because the brokers got margin called by the clearing houses for fuck sake. Now RH and other brokers might say it was liquidity issues but I can tell you for a fact that all those shorters got their shares from somewhere and if you think a few million people buying shares with CASH deposits in any way compares to the ALMOST CERTAIN losses that the brokers were facing due to likely defaults by shorters was the reason they turned off buying, you are dead fucking wrong. 

The brokers got margin called any way you look at it and they should have margin called the shorters. But they didn't. They pussied out and did something criminal. They affected one side of a trade and not the other, that is an unprecedented manipulation if ever I have seen one. But I ain't suprised by it and neither should anyone else and that is not the point of this post anyway.

Stop saying it didn't work, it was never going to work, we got greedy, we got stupid and all the other hind sight self delusions to make yourself feel better. The play worked because it went by the rules these people had set and you can't blame yourself or anyone else or redicule people for getting involved, when those rules get changed at the last second. The GME play was solid and made history, never forget that you fucking pussies.

Edit: I sold at 420.69 the other week and put it all back in on friday just gone, make of that whatever you want

yeah i took some profit, i never said i was the hero of this story..

Edit3: Can't keep up with comments. Either you believe brokers restricted buying because of increased collateral requirements due to USERS buying in CASH. Or you believe that maybe, the tens of billions of increased buyback costs on shares they had lent out where somehow setting off the clearing houses tolerance alarms.. your choice.

84,AMC Major Stakeholder Wanda Converts Stock To Allow For Sale,"A major Chinese investor in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) converted its shares in the cinema operator in order to be able to sell them, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

What Happened: Wanda America Entertainment Inc, a unit of Beijing-based Wanda Group, converted its Class B common stock to Class A AMC shares on Feb. 1 'in order to permit sales of its common stock,' according to the filing.

No details of how much stock was converted were given out in the SEC document.

The Chinese conglomerate had acquired the majority stake in AMC for $2.5 billion in May 2012.

Why It Matters: AMC is still a majority-owned subsidiary of the Wanda Group, as per the latter's website.

The theater chain along with GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted), and Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) are targets of r/WallStreetBets, a Reddit forum, that has been carrying out a short squeeze in recent weeks.

The short squeeze has caused institutional short-sellers such as Melvin Capital and Citron Research to pose losses as they cover their shorts.

The Reddit investors received support from celebrities, investors, and others like Mark Cuban, Dave Portnoy, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, and others.

In late January, AMC shares shot up as much as 804% at one point. The stock is up over 200% on a YTD basis as of Friday's closing.

Price Action: AMC shares closed nearly 3.7% lower at $6.83 on Friday and gained almost 0.6% in the after-hours session.

88,To Ape Gang: Why Sentiment Has Turned Against You,"I want you to understand this.  Truly.

I like GameStop.  I like $GME.  I believe in the long term plan (or what I/we think is the plan, anyway).  I bought a Pro Membership and have put in orders through the app I downloaded.  I think they'll kill 4Q earnings in March.

I THINK GAMESTOP IS A GOOD COMPANY.  I think Cohen and his team bring something to the table that will truly turn around the company.  I think CNBC and particularly Melissa Lee can go suck an egg with their dismissiveness of the bull case, which they barely even pretend to have considered.  I think the stock was and has been manipulated as fuck.

My personal belief, which I require nobody else to share, is that Ryan Cohen and gang also still have more buying to do, and their buying alone will drive the price up.  But my belief is that they have no interest in buying at this price, or they'd have done so.  I believe they're waiting for the price to fall back toward the fair market value.  And I believe they may force the issue by issuing more shares.  That's what I believe, and why I'm not holding positions right now.  I probably will in the future, but my personal opinion is the time is not right.

But you guys are actually fucking insane.  We dont have a problem with the stock.  We have a problem with YOU.

Many of the people who have joined WSB in the past two weeks are brand new to investing.  And that's okay!  But the new people (7 million new versus 1.5 million old) have done the following:

* Spent weeks downvoting every single ticker besides GME, AMC, BB, and NOK
   * Failed to realize there is no short squeeze on BB or NOK
   * Failed to realize the NOK spam was purely from bots
      * While you've realized there were bots that were bought, you missed (probably because you were spamming rocket emojis and gorillas) that the bots were spamming NOK.
   * Continually asked what stock WE are going to MANIPULATE next
* Tried to educate the crowd on terminology you just google ten minutes earlier.
   * I saw one person disagreeing with a long-time and well-respected poster here by telling other Apes to ignore that post, and to instead read a copied and pasted two paragraph blurb from investopedia that explained the effect of a stock split on a short position.  
* Made up securities laws and terminology that doesn't actually exist
   * Short ladders?  Every time a price falls from a peak it's a short ladder?  EVERY TIME?
   * You don't think that there's a natural reversion in the balance of supply & demand after a stock runs up thousands of percent in a matter of days?
* With zero understanding of market mechanics, explaining to others why price action is fake
   * ""Look how low volume is on this candle!  It's not a real drop!""
   * [the dip is fake](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lay22q/the_dip_is_fake_look_at_how_many_people_are/)
* Called people who have been involved in this play since Summer 2020 ""paperhand pussies"" for taking profits when the price of the stock went up 1,500%
* Turned WallStreetBets into a political activism forum
* Denying Reality
   * S3 partners is not lying to you.  They and Ortex are consistently the best sources of difficult-to-obtain information on short interest.  Just because they're reporting that short % of float is reduced FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL THAT ANY STOCK HAS EVER HAD does not mean that they're lying to you.
* Spammed low-effort memes and easily-Googleable questions on the new submissions
   * When your posts were taken down, you posted AGAIN
* Accused anybody with an opposing opinion of being a hedge fund shill/bot
* AGGRESSIVELY spamming to find buyers to help you get out of your huge negative position
* I want to gag every time I see somebody write ""I'm not a financial advisor"" following a post that makes that very clear
* Moving the goalposts
   * ""YOU ARE HERE on the VW short squeeze graph!""
   * ""We finished above $325!  Gamma squeeze!"" (Personal confession, I almost fell for this one and I'm glad I sold before the plummet).
   * ""Ok so there was no gamma squeeze Monday but Tuesday is the day!""
   * ""Ok we fell another 50% Tuesday but definitely Wednesday!""
   * ""Fuck it let's just harrass investor relations to help us!""
* Accused the mods of being paid off by hedge funds for doing what they've always done, which is remove shit-tier posts from the front page
   * which you then posted again
      * and again
* Completely ignored the rules of our subreddit
   * Market Manipulation -- 
   * No Pump & Dumps -- pressuring other people to buy low float stocks (such as GME) so that you can drive up buying demand and sell when you've decreased your losses is a scam.
   * Political Bullshit -- If you think ""it's not about the money"" then get the fuck out because it is absolutely about the money.
   * No Bullshitting -- There are so many of you advising others on their trades (followed by ""This is not financial advice, am ape"") while you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about aside from something you just read on Reddit 5 minutes ago, which was posted by somebody else who had no idea what the fuck they were talking about, which was based on a tweet they read 10 minutes before that from someone who DID know what they were talking about, but OP misinterpreted the meaning.
      * Believe it or not, that's against the rules.  Just say you dont know.  Or say nothing.  There's actually no need to spam.
* Gain & Loss Posts - nobody wants to see your Loss on one-third of a share of AMC.  Come on.
* YOLO - Your investment in one-third of a share of AMC is not a YOLO.  A YOLO is DFV leveraging up his entire $55,000 account with positions in a single ticker and letting it ride or die.
   * [not a fucking YOLO -- it's a picture of a billboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la96zj/my_amc_billboard_is_up_in_kalamazoo_mi/)
* Drowned out a lot of really good content on non-GME stuff
   * u/dhsmatt2 's [updated PRPL $1.1MM DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcgce1/1100000_purple_mattress_yolo_update/)
   * u/socialist_baby 's [$1.5MM YOLO on NVTA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le81ca/15m_nvta_yolo/)
   * I can't even find the others that I had in mind using the search tool because the entire list of YOLO's and DD's is filled with GME and AMC karma farming.
* And you've now begun brigading WSB from r/GME.

You have formed a cult.  You've now decided, amongst yourselves, that anybody who is not in on your play and wants to discuss other things is just a paid hedge fund shill.  Do you think that's a healthy mindset?

If this is the investment that you truly want to make, and you feel you have an understanding of the risks, then fucking ***let it rip.***  I hope it works out.  Seriously, I want you to make money.  I like Gain porn a lot more than Loss porn.

But stop bullshitting.  Stop brigading.  Stop spamming.

You're driving us nuts.

You put it a lot more kindly than I could have.This guy needs “hoovered adderal before premarket” flairI think a big thing here that made this place great was that even if you didn't agree with the post, if it was good quality you gave it an upvote regardless. 

I remember tons of posts with thousands of upvotes and the top comments just ripping them apart or making fun of them. That's what made this place entertaining and fun to be around.

Edit:

And example of this was a day or two ago someone posted a DD on $WWE and how he was buying calls. That post got buried with negativity and never saw the light of day even though he put in a lot of time and effort. Normally it would have had at least a couple thousand upvotes for the amount of effort he put in. Instead it was down voted to oblivion. 

I don't know what is more surprising to me though, that $WWE is a ticker or that this idiot actually thinks it'll make a comeback.I am new here and totally came on the GME wave but really have been fascinated by some of the other research that some of the long-term users have provided.

89,Geopolitics and semiconductors : Taiwan is leveraging TSMC/Qualcomm to force US confrontation on independence issue,"So you’ve probably heard the news of Taiwan being “thanked” by America for alleviating chip supplies. But there’s some geopolitics behind this. 

There’s talk that Taiwan is essentially putting all cards on the table and push the issue of independence at all costs in a do or die effort. Essentially, Taiwan wants to pressure America into announcing full on Taiwanese independence and committing to it. This would be the culmination of the modern Taiwan issue, and essentially would be the end of the 2 Chinas status quo. 

This is basically a gamble by the Taiwanese hawks (DPP) who are willing to sacrifice their reputation and market share of TSMC in order to force support.

How? 

By forcing an artificial shortage of chips. This not only leads to shortage of automobile chips for Chinese companies, but also incentivizes America to give full support. Btw, EU feels betrayed on this especially since they supported a Taiwanese petition to block lithiogram machines. 

The reason Taiwan is playing chicken is because they feel there is a limited opportunity to force American commitment before China grows too powerful. Likewise, US hawks also want to force a confrontation since it’s “now or never” before China reaches peer state status.

TLDR:

- Taiwan is planning an artificial shortage of chips especially for the auto sector to pressure US into independent support.

- Geopoltics is prioritized over business practices, since market share could be lost and business relations strained as EU/China/Us companies feel alienated and untrusting.

- DPP is using TSMC/Qualcomm for geopoltics in a last ditch effort to force Biden admin on the China issue 


What to do:

I honestly don’t really know. I’m hoping other ppl here can say how money can be made off this lol. I’d expect maybe AMD/Intel to go up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf5wgk/geopolitics_and_semiconductors_taiwan_is/,"TSMC also produces apples chips, and if I recall correctly Qualcomm as well. 

This could be a dual play to Samsung who produces Nvidias chips, and Intel since they produce their own chips. Quite a few angles you can look at it from and strategise multiple positions in the market to play into.

This is not financial advice, merely an observationThis issue has nothing to do with Taiwanese independence as that is a domestic political issue... this is about leverage in getting a FTA signed between Taiwan and the United States. It was looking as it would be signed during the last administration, but it didn't get done before the new administration took place. This is something that [Morris Chang (founder of TSMC) has previously asked Mike Pence about directly](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3577603).No joke my biggest hold up for investing in TSM is I don't trust China to not invade the island. Would be really bad for the portfolio...I don't care, Taiwan is its own nation. I gladly support it anytime rather than support whinny the poo.   


Who didn't spread a virus then pretend they were not the source?  


TaiwanTSM makes the best chips, and they supply everyone, BUT you should never get involved in a land war in AsiaSemiconductor outage is due the chip are better paid on cellphones and consumer industry than car manufacturers. 
Also several car factories where slowed by covid problems and the economy recession(globally). As most of those factories work whit ""lean manufacturing"" that doesnt allow you to storage several qty of primary materials, as chips. Now they need chips but most of them where owned by Smartphones manufacturers.

Tryong to explain taiwan and many others are manipulating chip su0plies sounds like another conspiranoic tale. Mining activities where slowed so we can also expect several raw elements needed in the semiconductor process could be get some shortage too. 
Every time that economy gets a hit, it takes some time to get his normal ""speed"". We must expecto also food shortage soon in some countries but not several at all.I don’t think China is going into Taiwan anytime soon. China measures success over generations, not based on what they can accomplish in a few years. Their messing around with Hong Kong is too fresh.How Intel/AMD are going up with this?. Are they not both outsourcing to TSMC anyways?.This person doesn’t know what they are talking about. Chip shortage in auto manufacturing is mostly due to orders cancelled or delayed by auto suppliers who order from TSM as a third party. Auto chips represent just 3% of their manufacturing volume. This DD is laughable, when China flew over Taiwan late last month the US sent a small armada into the South China Sea. 

The US and other countries are invested solely to protect their current supply as these chips are used for many military applications and an invasion of Taiwan would lead to geopolitical instability throughout Southeast Asia . 

If TSM was artificially constraining supply then why is Samsung also at full capacity for the exact same reasons. This doesn’t make sense at all.I'm interested in betting in favor of TSMC once GME is resolved, but I think I'll only keep an eye on this for now...",1612765892.0,86

Honestly just hold the shares that you have left and wait to see what happens if you can afford to lose it all, but at this point no idea what the future holds.Don't worry if its not the 9th then it will be the 16th, or possibly the 23rd or some future date. It will happen eventually, maybe, sort of or not.Be aware that short reporting come from the companies themselves, apparently they make the report and send it in - so they can absolutely falsify reports especially with all the other illegal and underhanded tactics we've seen.

*If* they got caught it's just another 20million or so fine - worth scaring people into selling and potentially saving billions over.

So even with the report on the 9th, take it with a grain of salt...Doesn't really matter what it shows as that data will only cover up to the 29th which is 2 days after the squeeze. I said before, whatever fuckery the HFs did, they did it last week.No one in the thread mentioned FTD? This is actual settlement rules.

29th was supposed to actual cover date. They didn't ...so it failed to deliver aka FTD.  

There on out they have 13 business days to cover, which is the 16th.

Their current automotive gross margins are 21% in comparison to 2.1% from Ford, gm, etc.

Tesla’s auto business: has a lot of potential and there’s a big runway in selling FSD which adds ~80% margin to every sale. 

Tesla insurance: they’re hiring actuaries everywhere so they can sell insurance to Tesla owners. One of the most important thing that ALL insurance companies want to know is HOW you drive. Usually they’ll give you some discount to put in an obd sensor in your car for a few months and give you a rate accordingly. Now imagine a car that already does this so they know every action the driver takes and can understand risk every second on the road.

Tesla solar has been - to date - an unmitigated disaster. Seriously. Read up on it. It's a clusterfuck of ridiculous proportions. People don't want to touch it. Overbudget, extremely late, poorly done. They have apparently just bounced after doing half a job and then couldn't be contacted.

I know several people with Powerwalls (solid product) and none of them have Tesla solar.

Big citation needed. This is classic ""baby's first startup"" Ali G math. ""It's an eleventy billion dollar market! IF WE CAN JUST GET 1% OMG SUCH MONEY WOW."" Ok cool beans, **how** are you going to get that 1%? Nevermind 10%. That is massive penetration (lol).  

> FYI Tesla has the cheapest solar by a long margin. 

Huge ""citation needed."" Not only has this been empirically shown to *not* be the case, it doesn't make much sense on the face of it. Traditional solar panels are about as simple as it gets. Wire some solar panels together under glass and you're done. Solar roof has a much more complicated process, much more complex install (that has yet to be demonstrated at scale), will suffer from worse efficiency due to aesthetic concerns (gotta look nice) not to mention inability to angle them for best production. Meaning you need more of them.

94,Violent demand incoming for uranium - why Cameco CCJ,"Over the last 10 years, uranium prices have fallen like a rock. They look like your portfolio before you discovered WSB. Like anything that needs to be extracted from the ground (oil 🛢, gold 🏆, etc), falling prices often mean permanent production shutdowns. But it’s time for that to turn around. [Excerpt](https://www.barrons.com/articles/covid-19-has-slammed-the-energy-sector-heres-a-hot-commodity-that-could-keep-rising-51589536800):

*Going into 2020, global nuclear utilities were expected to require roughly 182 million pounds of uranium concentrate to run reactors for the year, while expected global mine production was seen at 142 million pounds, he says. The pandemic has affected 50% of global uranium mine supply, or over six million pounds a month, so even a three-month loss would push production down to just over 120 million pounds this year, he says.*

Uranium isn’t like oil, you can’t buy significant amounts on the open market - reactor operators often have significant supply contracted out for decades. We’re at the point in the uranium cycle where reactor operators are beginning to open new contracts for supply into the next decade. And the best part is that price runs on uranium can be extremely violent, see [this chart](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/uranium) from the last time uranium went to the 🌕 from 2003-2007. Prices spiked from $25/lb to a peak of $140/lb. Excerpt from $CCJ filings:

*Uranium rallied 30% from March lows. Price upswings are normally violent and self-reinforcing because: ""History demonstrates that in general, when prices are rising and high, uranium is perceived as scarce, and a lot of contracting activity takes place. The heavy contracting that takes place during price runs, drives investment in higher-cost sources of production.""*

So much production was shut down in 2020 due to COVID that many producers have had to buy uranium on the spot market. As demand continues to outstrip supply, we might see a uranium bull cycle even crazier than that of the 2007 bull run.

What are the best tickers to express a long uranium bet? If you’re subscribed to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/), you could buy $URNM like a fucking loser. But why would we do that? I've lost money on $JNUG, I know not to play with small junior miners.

Call me a boomer but I prefer big established companies like **Cameco (ticker $CCJ)**. It’s been around for decades, and has lasted through multiple downturns. It has a market cap of $5B and even pays out a small dividend! We’re not fucking dividend investors though. My point is that Cameco is responsible for nearly 10% of global uranium production so **it’s not going anywhere**. Contracts to receive uranium with them are comprised of 40% fixed price and 60% spot - meaning that if prices of uranium on the open market moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀, you’ll see the same for their revenues.

Since no one knows when the SQUEEZE is going to happen, I suggest you buy shares or LEAP calls. Don’t gamble what you’re not willing to lose. That’s why I recommend somewhat OTM LEAP calls because of the long-term nature of this play.

Low-risk assets are used at the start of retirement (and usually have an expected lower rate of return, due to lacking a risk premium). Higher-risk assets would be placed in a basket used at the end of retirement.

OK that was fun. We know a little more about a common term in investment strategy in ""Laddering"". We know that IPO Laddering was deemed illegal and reported on at length; where a party is able to artificially set the price of a stock by forming an agreement with another party that underwrites the retail price.

Now in the more in-depth version of the ""Short Ladder Attack"" article written \~6 years ago that's lately been passed around, the author describes at length how ""Naked Shorts"" can be combined with ""Laddering"" strategy to artificially set the price of a stock via shares not actually owned by either party. This is effectively what the blogger coined as the ""Short Ladder Attack"" strategy.

\------------------------------------

>***Naked Short*** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud.

>The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy.

tl;dr - focusing on the terminology for ""short ladder attack"" is pedantic; what's being described is the combination of a Laddering price manipulation tactic combined with Naked Shorts. Both of those things are things.

I'm pretty retarded so I can't personally really imagine one being able to actually form a real case given data available to the public, or even those with terminal access. You'd need a real investigation with the power to subpoena data from the source.

Yes, the concepts described in the ""Short Ladder Attack"" article are real things. You can call it a number of things, but it's effectively a similar tactic to all ""laddering"" via shares neither party actually owns.

“I thought it was a really interesting way to kind of shed light on the situation that’s been going on,” Reath said.

98,PDC Newsletter: Trading Week Ending 2/12,"Dear Member,

Hello fellow degenerate gambler! May I introduce you to the Pretty Decent Crew's newsletter for the trading week ending on February 12th? We hope that this email finds you well and not dead from the Meme Stonk War of 2021.

Compared to the last few weeks, we have a relatively boring week coming up. Our primary goal is to move our assets into areas that will produce steady gains. I have two focuses with this.

1. Use the current situation to optimize gains through high risk and volatile stocks that could shoot us in the foot.
2. Acquire holdings that will let us cash in on the technological transition over the coming years
3. I know, it was intended to be two, but let's be real. We are definitely going to hold out buying power for options on the Disney earnings report!

My first thoughts here are that our situation doesn't allow for high quality options trading given that there are huge transitions occurring within the retail investor. We have a horde of idiots moving on from GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. They have no idea what to do other than go back on the Palantir train. With these things in mind, we're going to make a couple safer plays this week and minimize new options.

Worth noting, but not detailed this week is a movement of long holding funds into ARK related ETFs (including PRNT). After reading through ARK's Big Idea's 2021, I truly believe their ETFs are going to obliterate the S&P over the coming 6-12 months. This is heavily dependent upon how much innovation occurs and is facilitated by the government. If the current trend continues, they're going to average well over 20% this year due to the needs of companies moving into new sectors of technology. I don't know which will be the most notable; so, I've chosen to hold all of their assets.

&#x200B;

* DIS (The Mouse)
   * It's time to bet the house on The Mouse. With earnings coming up after hours Thursday 2/11, they're going to continue their pop they've been showing over the previous week. It's VERY tough to tell where they're going to end the week, but this is a prime opportunity to do some quality percentage gains on OTM calls. If you're looking at high premiums, make sure you're careful to play the higher traffic options so that you don't get burned. I'll personally recommend steering clear of the $200 number unless you're willing to risk it all. Disney clearing the $200 mark this week would be massive. The lower premium makes it enticing, but it won't happen unless their subscriber numbers are through the roof. For me, I'm shooting for $190 in hopes of getting a quality OTM to ITM transition and then dumping it at open on Friday.

&#x200B;

* CVS (You know you want to do it...)
   * WIth earnings coming up 2/16, they're expected to crush the estimated earnings. The problem here is of course: ""are the earnings already priced in?"" You know what? Maybe they are, maybe they aren't. CVS fluctuated over $2.50 in price over the last week alone ($71.50 - $74.00). I'm going to dig deep and hit the $75C for 2/19 in hopes of a solid outcome on earnings. Will this happen? I'm going to say yes, BUT I wouldn't expect it to hold. Both Walgreens and CVS stock have been more volatile than usual given the hopes they receive approval as vaccine distribution locations. I'm going to hold the calls in hopes of a solid pop and then dump them all when there are high hopes of a solid close on 2/19.

&#x200B;

* MARA + RIOT
   * I'm going to double down on these two because of the general adaptation occurring throughout large corporations. There is no reason to think this will die off. The limited supply of Voldemort and ""the halvening"" that occurred in the last year will also contribute to a continued rise in Voldemort demand.
   * According to ARK, if companies move ONLY 1% of their free cash into Voldemort, it will rise by $40,000. Now this is a long stretch, but if they moved to 10% of free cash into Voldemort, it would jump by $400,000. This seems unrealistic right now, but 1% is absolutely possible. Multiple companies including Square have already adopted this concept with great success.
   * MARA is successfully moving up this week towards new ATHs. Voldemort will likely continue to rise over the coming year. The play here is obviously not short term returns. The play is holding a company that will be worth 2-3x in the coming years.
   * RIOT is now right back on track with its three month moving average. The volatility here is inevitable given the movements in Voldemort and associated Voldemort infrastructure.

&#x200B;

* CCIV
   * CCIV crushed last week and I'm going to double down on this too because Lucid and CCIV refuse to acknowledge or deny the rumors of their merger/acquisition. If I were a gambling man (I am), I would hold a small stake of CCIV shares as I hold deep OTM calls with a heavy Theta. At a $50 strike, you will pay 10% extra for the 8/20 calls over the May calls. May could be a tight race to guarantee the acquisition is occurring. August gives us a strong theta and will allow it to grow.

Sincerely,

Lehman Brothers' Risk Management Department

30| 99.29| 94.98
60| 99.64 | 96.26
90 | 101.7 | 81.69

As you can see, the current score line (31 to 9 for TB) is a bullish sign for GME

103,Feb 9th GME Short Interest Data,"I have some theories about the  short interest data coming out 2/9 that will include shorts that have settled by 1/29. 

If shorts settle T+2, and it’s only reporting shorts settled by 1/29, that would be trades executed 1/27 or before.  Missing any data from that Thursday fuckery by Robinhood etc and the following Friday with the all time high. 

Between 1/14-1/21 it traded in a very tight range 38.00-44.00 with good volume. Could that have been people covering their shorts. Is it possible the run up in price was actually just momentum off of the 1/22 trading day jump(which could of been caused by large shorts being covered and HFs booking losses). If you go back to that week and search for news regarding GME by each day. On 1/22 you see a giant spike in GMe articles, media talking about it, Jim Cramer tweeted out 1/22 that GME was a squeeze of a life time etc. this Reddit blew up etc. Will look for a large decrease in shorts to confirm that theory  but..

anyone who shorted the stock from 1/25-1/27 is going to add to the short interest number in the 1/29 report. Any shorts established between 1/25-1/27 made huge profits last week and could of been covered. Meaning the short interest data would show shorts that may actually not exist anymore. 

Because the market is reacting 100x faster to GME moves than it was prior to the 1/15 data is SI data becoming less powerful as a predictor? 

Thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf1y46/feb_9th_gme_short_interest_data/,"Sir, this is a Dollar Tree.I believe short interest is higher than indicated by s3, but based on volume, the buyers aren’t there anymore.  The whales that cashed out probably won’t re-enter, and the little retail aren’t going to move the stock much.  I think lots of momo hedge funds played a big role in the gamma squeeze and not sure they’ll want to swim in the water now.

But wtf do I know, maybe it moons, maybe it doesn’t.Squeeze has not been squoze.SI was never a good indicatorRH has again manipulated data of GME in their depth charts. The buy orders are not cumulating while the sell orders are. I cross compared this with AMC depth charts to see if it was an isolated event. It is.

[https://imgur.com/a/Z2ND1Hc](https://imgur.com/a/Z2ND1Hc)Let's get this right. Tomorrow is bigger than any earnings report because this is a technical trade based on short interest. The price dropped after the 29th and it seems (from my autistic view of the market) an impossibilititty that they covered after thatIt's the same conspiracy about how it's supposed to happen next week this or that blah blah blah. These guys are just trying to dwindle your hope with the carrot in your face.

The moon is happening no matter what!! Don't listen to this crap!

Disclaimer: I'm definitely a human posting this as humans do. I am not programmed to give financial advice to other humansYes.Sir, this is the Good Will.Shorts covered and retail sold. The squeeze squoze. The hedges have lit the option chain up all the way up to 800 to avoid big money targeting their positions. Retail is alone in this fight now and it won't end the way most of you think it will. There isn't a squeeze coming because they're no longer in a tough spot. Borrowing fees are way down and they're hedged well. 

Also. Trading on two week old data is not effective. At all. The SI numbers were helpful leading up to they hype because retail had the drop on the shorts. This isn't the case anymore and the SI numbers are useless.

GME has had 1 billion volume in two weeks. There's no real telling where the fuck everything is or who owns what.
I'm sorry to tell you this, but its the truth.

Edit to add: im sorry that you guys feel the need to downvote everything that goes against your confirmation bias.. I'd appreciate somebody arguing the points I made and pointing out any flaws if you feel like there are any.. instead of just calling me a bot and getting angry about how the brokers fucked up momentum.

The company has been recognized for innovation; for example it has developed technologies that allow mobile phone batteries to be made at room temperature rather than in expensive, heated dry rooms.

In 2010, BusinessWeek ranked BYD the eighth most innovative company in the world [\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Company#cite_note-businessweek-30) and that same year saw Fast Company ranking BYD as the 16th most innovative.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Company#cite_note-fastcompany-31)

In 2017, PV Magazine has awarded BYD the top category of innovation on its newly launched battery storage system that advances progress in three categories: modularity, charging and discharging capacity, and efficiency.

112,The Future of Robinhood,"I’ve been thinking about what becomes of a broker that can’t handle the stresses of volatile markets. We have a system where the strong survive and the weak get devoured. It’s hard to imagine Robinhood will endure given the events of these past few weeks, so what becomes of them? Well, they have something of value, but clearly do not have the infrastructure or the know how to swim in the ocean with the other sharks. It is my belief, that they will be acquired, and if I had to guess? It’ll be Goldman. The shiniest white shoes on the street have expanded into the consumer market with Marcus, and their biggest rival, Morgan Stanley, just bought E-trade. Acquiring a retail broker makes a lot of sense, but Goldman has had a problem. Who could they buy? In terms of US based brokers, all the appropriate sized acquisition targets had been picked off, until now. I think it would be a win-win, because ‘Robinhood, a Goldman Sachs Company’ solves a lot of problems. No one would ever question Robinhood’s solvency again. Goldman would oust the ‘broker bros’ like Vlad that clearly are in way over their heads, will gain millions of accounts, and strengthen their position in the consumer market.

115,"Proper, Detailed DD On Options For This Week!","Edit: Unity and Peloton are still slipping. While I still stand by them 100%, getting in later today is probably a better idea. I am sorry if you bought at 126 or so on Unity (though it is holding it), but it should recover this week. 

 Good evening, gentlemen. I present to those reading this a few options plays for this week that I'm pretty confident are going to print. Rather than holding losses, these couple of plays will likely give consistent 50-100% profits. I edited out the no-no words and crude jokes after auto-mod keeps taking this down...whatever.

1. Chegg ($CHGG) puts.  

Chegg has been running up to an ATH ahead of earnings. As noted in my last post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldpc2n/chgg\_cheating\_chegg\_putsa\_decent\_opportunity/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldpc2n/chgg_cheating_chegg_putsa_decent_opportunity/)) , their guidance generally falls short. The stock is currently way overextended, and with the somewhat-near reopening of schools, there will be a damper on their growth projections. I'm predicting a pullback to $95 or so.  

Suggested options: 2/19 100/105 put debit spread (sell 2/19 $100P, buy 2/19 $105P), OR purchase the 2/19 $90P


2. Unity ($U) calls--SAFE TENDIES  EDIT:Still slipping today a bit. Advisable to wait until afternoon or so to enter position 

As you may have noticed, Unity (software developer, about 60-70% of mobile games use their tech) took a massive dive after earnings. Despite great profits and revenue, their slightly slower growth projections led to a massive overreaction, and it dumped 14% from $147 to $128 in a frenzy of selling that, importantly, had several spikes to $140. There is still positive buying pressure.  
Even aside from the fundamentals of the stock, guess who bought the dip? CATHIE WOODS. $ARKK acquired a nice 764,700 (!) shares on February 5th. Mama Woods is still confident in this stock. As should you--there was nothing so terribly wrong about their earnings that they deserved to dump to $128. Mobile games are still doing great, and their revenue will continue to be strong. This is a perfect dip buying opportunity, and the spikes back to $140 intermittently on Friday exemplify the buying strength. It WILL return to $140 soon unless the market as a whole dives.  

Positions: $U 2/19 $140C, 3/19 $150C.


3. Peloton ($PTON) calls--Trust The Woods  

Peloton was another company that had stellar profits, but dumped heavily on minor slowing growth projections. Revenue? Increased 128% to $1.06 billion. Subscriptions? Increased by several hundred percent each for their Connected Fitness as well as digital subscriptions. Your wife? Getting heftier each day, and mad that her $1900 bike order is getting delayed due to the massive flood of orders. Peloton has had to spend about $100 million to address these delays with expedited air shipping and the like. Aside, do NOT forget they also are acquiring Precor, giving them a solid footing in the post-Covid gym ecosystem.  
What happened to the stock? Again, like Unity, dumped solely because of minor dents in their projections. It also nicely recovered during the day (I managed to get in at $143, hehe)  
TL;DR? Peloton's bottom line is not affected significantly. Their growth is explosive, and continuing to rise. Cathie Woods again acquired another tasty 106,200 shares for ARKW. What does this mean? If she buys the dip, you need to buy the dip too.  

Suggested options: 2/19 $150C, 3/19 $165C


4. Twitter ($TWTR) puts.  

As in October...and July...and April...and February...and the October before that....Twitter earnings generally dump the stock at least 10%. Why did it do this every time? Slowing user growth, as well as uncertainty regarding ad revenue (they stopped running election ads) meant that the stock dove off a cliff every time. Now? People are (likely) leaving Twitter in droves. I had some info here about why, but I'm assuming that the auto mod keeps removing this post after I say the name of the former President, so I'm just going to leave it at that.  
Technical analysis? It's been running up to an ATH. The potential for it to dump right after earnings is INSANELY high--all it needs is a slight blemish on projections. And I'm pretty sure there will be many, many scars on their projections.  
On the flip side, their profits will likely be very good. Thing is, I simply do not see how banning the former President will help their bottom line and growth projections. Let me know what you think about this below.  

Suggested options: heck, why not 2/12 $50P for $93. You could do a longer date and higher strike, but honestly, either it dumps or it doesn't.


5. ArcelorMittal ($MT) Calls--steel gang isn't done yet  

The reasons for purchasing $MT and other steel stocks such as $VALE and $CLF have largely not changed. However, most of them have been sadly flatlining other than $X's brief rocket to $24 before pulling back...and then doing an offering.  
The normal reasons still apply--demand is high, supply is low, new infrastructure projects on the way, etc. This is pretty much just a gamble on earnings positively reflecting on the factors already in existence, and giving some momentum back to the stock. Plus, the calls are pretty cheap with relatively low IV, so it doesn't hurt to toss a little money at it. But to be clear, this is a much less assured play than the 3 I have already listed.  

Positions: $MT 2/19 $23C for $66. Could also just YOLO a 2/12 call on Wednesday at market close, should cost around $30 each


There are some other very major earnings coming up this week as well. Disney, GM, Uber/Lyft, Enphase. I might also do some weekly $DIS calls and ride the run-up to earnings, and then sell before earnings as positive Disney Plus news might already be priced in with their Investors' Day fireworks.

In any case, I might post some more DD on other things I find and research. Only slight annoyance is that barely any people see these types of posts amidst the ""har dar GME give me upvotes because I spent 30 seconds making this meme""",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf0t2c/proper_detailed_dd_on_options_for_this_week/,"I appreciate the non-GME infotainment - thank you kind person100% agree with the $TWTR put play...Watching for the $54's to dip in price on a continued pre-earnings run up...and the inevitable crash after close on 2/9I hope you are right on TWTR. I have  a 40/60 strangle Mar19 that I rolled from last month because of an IV spike that put me under water. It’s now at the high end of the strangle and IV is still pretty elevated. I hope the IV juice drops a lot after earnings and a 10% pull back would work nicely for me. Cheers!I am going to follow your chegg and unity plays!!CME (NOT GME) has options this week. I bought because it seems like more people got into trading, and also, the recent craze has put more volume in the market.I was going to buy PTON and U calls at the close on Friday but a had to take a call at work and I missed the close smh, also was on the fence on CHGG puts but since you seconding my conclusions gives me more conviction so I'll do it. I think TWTR is a good risk/reward play for this earnings but overall I am bullish so idk. 

Also look into CRSR, they are going to crush it on earnings, reporting Tuesday BMO, I will be balls deep in callsBe careful with twitter. Pretty sure it’s artificially propped up by the government because they are using it as their way to communicate to the masses. Aka propaganda arm of the government.Followed your $U plays, here's hopingJust grabbed five $U 3/19 $135C when it hit 124, take me to tendie townI see you comrade.",1612747758.0,313

121,Why to REALLY buy GME (Solid DD),"LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT TO INVEST IN GME AT THESE PRICES (Short sqeeze and hype aren't reasons). 

Sherman started a turnaround of Gamestop when he first took over April 2019. He cut the dividend, began consolidation (cut some fatty stores), and began debt reduction. COVID threw a wrench in this because he didn't move online nearly fast enough. 

When Burry first invested in GME, there was a reason. What reason? He spoke with Sherman about his plans and thought they wouldn't just survive, but thrive. Cohen also had a similar situation, and later of course he got involved. Sherman listens to both, and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move Gamestop forward. 

Fils-Aimé the Nintendo guy that likes to turn companies around is added to the board. He turns stuff around as a hobby and is an insanely good marketer. This is shown in particular with his Nintendo of America endeavors. u/kitrosreddit told me not to forget about Reggie so I didn't this time (sorry to the 100ish people that saw this a few days ago) 

Next up we see the Microsoft deal. Although exact numbers aren't available that I can find, Gamestop will be receiving a royalty from gaming equipment sold via Microsoft. Microsoft is also expanding Gamestop's inventory on the inside and employees will use Microsoft software to run the stores. Microsoft doesn't want Gamestop to fail, nor will they let them. With 27% of new games bought at Gamestop and 40% of used games bought there, Microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle. 

We recently saw Gamestop's holiday earnings. With a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil, they were unprofitable this year. The current P/S ratio makes no sense unless it is expected to go out of business (good luck) or that it will not grow significantly over the coming years (lol). However, this is expected to change with earnings starting in March. They are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well. Gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt. How are they going to pay this off!!!??? Liquidating stores and consolidation. This was a Cohen continuation idea that Sherman had started, just without the vision to make it succeed. A small stock offering (let's say 2%) would also leave them in an excellent financial situation. Additionally, we have the 300% YOY online sales increase, which accounted for over 30% of total sales. This is only expected to increase moving forward. While overall sales decreased by 3% YOY, inefficient stores were cut out of the picture. Comparative store sales increased by 5% YOY, but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on 'nonessential' businesses. Places that had significantly fewer COVID numbers had over 30% YOY growth. 

Next, we have the Chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors. Out with the old, in with the new. Even though most directors were acquired in 2020, these new additions add incredible value to the company. Sherman listens to Cohen. Cohen and friends had some focuses at Chewy that led to insane amounts of profit. They focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. Expect the same for Gamestop. This was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership. All ears are on Cohen and his ideas to make Gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop. 

Most recently were the adds on 2/3/21 Francis: That AWS engineering guy that's now heading technology!? Nice. Durkin: Customer service VP from Chewy is now in charge of Gamestop's customer service!? Fuck yes Chewy has insanely good customer service. Krueger: Big filler boi from Amazon et all now running e-commerce fulfillment!? Dope.

131,How 75% of GME Shares Are Still Shorted. S3 is Wrong.,"  

\*First off, this is my opinion based on the facts available. This is by no means financial advice. I am not a financial advisor\*

If you are not familiar with EDGAR, it is the SEC’s database for various types of company filings. One of those filings is called the 13G. 

\*“The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Schedule 13G form is an alternative filing for the Schedule 13D form and is used to report a party's ownership of stock which exceeds 5% of a company's total stock issue. Schedule 13G is a shorter version of Schedule 13D with fewer reporting requirements.”\*

When a company decides to dispose of beneficial ownership of stock, and holds more then 5% of shares available, they are required to AMEND the filing 13G, making it the 13G/A. When these documents are submitted, they are filed under both the beneficial owner and issuer of stock in EDGAR. 

In the case of GameStop’s “short squeeze”, and understanding the exchange of shares during that time period, BlackRock Inc. (BLK) was the only institutional holder, owning over 5% of shares, that liquidated their position SO FAR. BlackRock Inc. liquidated 9,217,335 shares of GameStop on 1/26/2021.

[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&ciks=0001364742&entityName=BlackRock%2520Inc.%2520(BLK)%2520(CIK%25200001364742)&startdt=2016-01-26&enddt=2021-01-27&page=5](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&ciks=0001364742&entityName=BlackRock%2520Inc.%2520(BLK)%2520(CIK%25200001364742)&startdt=2016-01-26&enddt=2021-01-27&page=5)

\^control-f: GameStop

BlackRock is the SECOND largest institutional holder of GME, behind FMR LLC with 9,534,090 shares, according to Yahoo Finance. So… you are probably wondering, “How many shares of GME do The Top 10 Institutions hold combined ?”

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME)

Let’s Count:

\*FMR LLC\*   9,534,090

\*BlackRock Inc\*    - 9,217,335 (According to 13G/A)

\*Vanguard Group Inc.\* 5,288,507

\*Susquehanna International Group LLP\* 4,444,128

\*Dimensional Fund Advisors LP\*  3,948,114

\*Senvest Management LLC\*  3,225,740

\*State Street Corporation\* 2,609,487

\*Morgan Stanley\* 1,995,842

\*Paradice Investment Management LLC\* 1,832,526

\*Norges Bank Investment Management\* 1,811,792

Total: 25,472,891 Shares of GME or 25.473/46.89 = **54% of Float Shares**

&#x200B;

On the same Yahoo Finance page where we found ‘Top Institutional Holder’ data, if you scroll down, you can see ‘Top Mutual Fund Holders’. Combined, these funds hold 18.75/46.89 = **40%** of float shares.

\*Note that two of these mutual funds own over 5% of shares, meaning they would need to file with the SEC if they were to sell. These two mutual funds hold **22%** of float shares. \*

Accounting for BlackRock’s liquidation, **54**% of shares are held by the Top 10 Institutional Holders at the moment. Lets say, worst case scenario, only the two biggest mutual funds are left holding shares, making that **22%** of float shares. So far, we have accounted for **76%** of all shares. 

The last data we have on short interest is \~**122%** of float shares. The media has reported numbers as low as **33%** short interest post squeeze**,** according to S3 partners. Mathematically, this is impossible. 

If short interest is truly **33%,** that means these institutional holders would have filed a 13G/A…. But they didn’t…..meaning they did not sell. This means that there is still, **at a minimum, 76% of float shares shorted.**  This is VERY high and could cause another squeeze.

**TL:DR**

As you know, lots of bagholders around the world are not selling. It just so happens that we are not alone. We have some of the BIGGEST institutions bagholding with us; **minimum** **76% of float shares in fact**. If you thought that we were the only greedy and vengeful mfs out there, you are sorrily mistaken. These institutions (i.e. Fidelity, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley) want to see this second squeeze just as much as you. Until then, HOLD THE LINE!!!

Edit: I made a mistake. The 13G/A that BlackRock Inc filed on 1/26/2021 was a statement of ownership form, declaring that their position of GME was 9,217,335 shares. There was no liquidation of shares.

Edit: An institutional owner that owns more then 5% of float shares needs to file a 13D/A within 10 days if their ownership changes by 1% or more. This is important when searching for updated data on what institutions exchanged shares.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leyrrr/how_75_of_gme_shares_are_still_shorted_s3_is_wrong/,"After [this](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355923885468876802) tweet and immediate change right after (over a weekend) i wouldn't really trust S3 with anything

edit: also i would like to add that IF the majority of the shorters actually didn't cover early on the run-up, it would have been INSANELY risky to re-short from the top without knowing most brokers would have systematically halted buying of GME, which invalidates the theory that the original funds have now a much better and higher shorting avg. Imo only new funds might have risked shorting from the top and they will start taking profit after an 80% drop...*> "" BlackRock Inc. liquidated 9,217,335 shares of GameStop on 1/26/2021. ""*

What? This form doesn't say they liquidated anything. This number is the updated count of the shares they hold, which is actually an increase since the last report.

Look at the top of the form, it says "" December 31, 2020"". They didn't liquidate anything. This form just says what the updated number of shares they hold as of Dec 31st.

Please double check that info and correct your post.  


Edit: OP added corrected info to the post edit, thanks!the only reason i didnt sell was because i wanted to be part of history, and held on my shares as proof, (700$) it's not little for me but nothing i can't recover fromOne very important thing I must corect is that Blackrock in fact DIDN'T SELL their shares.

You must have found out they made a filing, that's true, but you need to read the contents of the filing too. 

It isn't about Blackrock selling shares of Gamestop. It's been filed because ""The interest of 1 such person, iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF, in the common stock of GAMESTOP CORP is more than five percent of the total outstanding common stock"". 

It's just parent holding company (Blackrock) reporting that one of it's parts (this small cap ETF) has more than  5% of GME stock allocated to it.

And that's THE ONLY REASON why they made a SEC filing. No shares sold. Period! Please stop spreading this misinformation if you haven't even read the filing...If 75% of GME shares are shorted, then does that mean shorts covered 30% - 50% of their short positions? Can a lucrative short squeeze actually happen from a 75% SI?Institutional holders and mutual funds overlap.  By a lot.Okay, without getting eaten by the mob.... Do we know what the share price they shorted it at is now?

If they closed 80% of their $20 shorts, then reshorted it at $400, wouldn’t they technically be making money off the new short positions?Stop calling GME share holders as bag holders.

Not everyone is a bag holder and not everyone has lost or is losing money.

Many people are owners of shares on house money...You're assuming that lenders who get their stock back from shorters immediately sell it.The edit (that BlackRock didn't sell) needs to be at the top of the post for this one. Since BlackRock didn't sell it means the short% of float is likely much higher than the 75% you stated.",1612741130.0,8558

135,Is AMC at the current price ($6.83) a good deal?,"Some of you are of the belief that AMC is post-pandemic value play. And that once the pent up demand for seeing movies in theaters is unleashed that AMC will be revitalized and soaring back to it's $30 share price from a few years ago. There is one big problem with that - AMC is already valued well above what it was leading up to the pandemic. 

For AMC to reverse course, soaring back to it's 2017 highs - a $3.27 billon market cap - that's really only about $9.41 a share based on todays number of shares outstanding. 2017 had also seen operating revenue soar from $3.2 billion to $5.0 billion (growth that it came nowhere near sustaining). The following 2 years had $5.4 billion in revenue along with increasing long term debt. 

[https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#)

Silver Lake converting $600 million of notes into equity was certainly a fortunate turn of events for AMC.  While this may take bankruptcy off the table,  there are still [debt problems](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/amc-entertainment-debt-soars-as-company-claims-to-have-staved-off-bankruptcy-62274670) remaining.  Long Term debt had already more than doubled between [2017 and 2019](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#) \- from $4.8 billion to $9.7 billion. 

I at one point bought into the AMC hype and that it would be heading for the moon - and for a moment it did. The reality is that if you bought in under $4 you've already done very well - and perhaps far better than you should have expected. 

Even AMC at $4.50 values the company about where it was January 2, 2018. Pre-pandemic, pre-Silver Lake loan and almost $5 billion less in long-term debt.  

Do you what you want.

Look. 

You’re looking at this in a conservative manner. If hedge funds didn’t continue to be able to profit off of speculative shorts on stocks, you’re frame of mind would be accurate, as it is valid. 

Regardless of how we view somethings value(or lack of), Every commodity, currency, every **thing** on earth becomes more valuable when the supply of it diminishes, and in this case it doesn’t have to be finite like a mineral. 

Expedite the time table of that value rising when the supply shortage becomes public(think about toilet paper at the beginning of the pandemic for instance, or the price gauging of face masks etc). 

**TL;Dr:** The rational value of anything becomes irrelevant the moment there becomes less and less of it.

137,GME FINRA short volume data,"We  have a bunch of posts that base some theories off the FINRA short  volume data. This post is just a quick reminder that the FINRA data has  some conditions:

If you read through the 05/2019 Information Notice ([https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019)) they state that the data:

""(1)  does not include any trades that are not publicly  disseminated, (2) is  not consolidated with exchange data, and (3) does  not—and is not  intended to—equate to short interest position  information. ""

In  general the short volume overstates the actual short position volume. A useful check are the  exchange short volume numbers from marketbeat for instance ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)).

For example the total short sold volume as reported by the exchange ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/))   - \~61.8Mil -  for the week ending 1/15 does not match either the total   short volume reported by FINRA (for all exchanges) - \~84.5Mil- or even   just for NYSE - 24.7Mil.

Also, the Total Volume combined for all exchanges from FINRA for let's say the 22nd Jan (97Mil) is smaller than the one reported by the exchange \~195Mil which agrees with the Yahoo number.

For a Buy or Sell for  instance - there may be multiple trades behind the Buy that need to be  made to deliver or sell your shares - including maybe a short sale or  two. Now these shorts will be covered quickly, but they still show up in  the FINRA numbers - I think these complex trade chains are root of the  problem.

Like  always if I am wrong let me know and I can either take this down or  edit it appropriately. I just want us to be better informed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leyc9v/gme_finra_short_volume_data/,"Nobody knows anything anymore.Instructions unclear, gonna keep holdingFINRA began publishing the Daily Short Sale Volume File, which provides aggregate daily short sale volume data by security for off-exchange trades in listed stocks, as well as for trades in non-exchange-listed  (or OTC equity) securities (the Daily File). The Monthly File and Daily File are collectively referred to herein as the “Short Sale Files.”  


For example, suppose that for security ABCD, FINRA published a combined  short sale volume of 3,000 shares and total volume of 15,000 shares for  all of its trade reporting facilities.7 Viewing only this off-exchange data published by FINRA, the percentage of short sale volume to total volume would appear to be 20%. Suppose, however, that there was also activity for ABCD executed on the New York Stock Exchange  (NYSE) that day totaling 125,000 shares, of which 12,000 shares were reported as short. This volume is published by NYSE on its website, separate from the volume published by FINRA. When considered together, the overall percentage of short sale volume to total volume for ABCD  that day is 10.7%, which is much lower than the data published on the FINRA website would suggest.

Late on my dedicated time of 1pm EST, but here are the earnings this week with high short interest and days to cover. Just to clarify some of this, in order to make the list, they must meet both of these conditions: they must have a short interest above 5%, and ALSO must have a ""Days to Cover"" (DTC) greater than 3.

Edit: there seems to be some confusion, as expected when dealing with fellow crayon eaters. This is a list of companies with a higher potential for short squeeze this week due to 1) high short interest, 2) lower volume relative to amount of shares sold short, 3) a catalyst (earnings) this week that could bring in other retail and institutional investors. Yes, I know (insert stock) has 40%+ Short Interest and isn't on my list of ""low short interest shit"", great, they don't report earnings this week, they're not going to be on it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lexumy/earnings_this_week_with_high_short_squeeze/,"That's not how it works...

A stock around 10% shorted is never going to squeeze.  Even the highest short interest company on your list isn't going to squeeze without a big catalyst(not just good earnings).  So please give it up, short squeezes are very rare.  GME is one of the most shorted stocks ever and the catalysts it needed were still massive because it was shorted for a reason.  Your not going to be able to squeeze any of these stocks unless the fundamental reason the stock was shorted changes, like what happened with GME.

143,Why RITE AID is (RAD) not BAD,"Hello :-)

I am back today to share my DD on a company I have long loved but only recently started investing in. Posting this today so people can invest tomorrow if they want.  My timing is usually poor for posting my findings.

**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, robinhood is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you’re saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It’s okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

*WHAT DOES THIS MEAN*

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.

Rite aid is starting vaccinations on February 12th, along with other pharmacies.  I believe they will be seeing a significant increase in revenue.

*PROMISING NUMBERS*

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

For those that can’t read, this tells us that rite aid is seeing close to **TWENTY FOUR** billion in revenue a year and is only being valued at a little over ONE billion at the current stock price.  They’re looking at over 6 billion in property and two billion in inventory.  

**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on Rite Aid, but I would also consider this a long term play.  I own 1000 shares and a bunch of calls spread out.  I expect a bump next week as vaccine/corona cycles back into the news.  

I also believe Rite Aid is undervalued.  It *should* be trading at 50$ right now.  It has potential to be trading at ~100.

And >50% of the 54million shares are held by institutions, with 20% being used to short.

20x 34.5 2/19 c is my immediate play

Edit: my position is 24.5 c I am as they say retarded",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lexqun/why_rite_aid_is_rad_not_bad/,"the ol' RAD cycle here on WSB. a classicYou would have loved this place like 3 or 4 years agoSo you say it *should* be trading around 50, so why is it not? What’s the case against Rite-Aid?rite aid in my town is now a walgreensHow much ice cream did they sell?

We just came from cold months....20x 34.5 2/19  c

Sorry, what? You're expecting this stock to go up 50% within two weeks?It sure isJust a vaccine dd? Wack... how about the proliferation of tinder and plan b sales to boost earnings.RAD was one of my first ""big"" wins (<$500, but back then that was 25% of what I was gambling with).Back to RAD are we lol",1612738123.0,35
144,Some AMC “DD” for the average 🦍,"I’ve seen a few people finally bring up AMC as something more than GME’s honorable mention. I’m just a casual trader who was holding 1k of AMC and some option contracts before this clown fiesta of a market trend showed up. I’ve done a fair amount of “DD” on AMC, but this is more conceptual potential based off news articles. Don’t expect math or grounded market concepts from this since that’s pretty far out of my trading style. Although, here are some key factors that have made me vary bullish on AMC before all this artificial price inflation.

Let talk about the AMC is a dying business concept. I don’t believe that in the slightest. I mean yes it’s much easier to stay and home and stream new movies, and yes a lot of big name producers have been dabbling with the straight to streaming release concept. Although, most of the titles being released straight to streaming have been smaller budget titles that weren’t expected to pull huge crowds in theater. With the exception of the new Wonder Woman and Pixar movies. That being said the budget for WW was 200 million and for Soul it was over 150 million. These budgets are common place for big block buster now a days. A fraction of $7-$12 subscription fee would likely have profits that would break even on budgets this large. Defiantly when you factor in costs of other movies and original content that is also in production. No movie producer is looking to break even on budget costs. They want huge profits margins which are mostly realized in box office sales.

This brings us to the life cycle stage of movies and how it maybe changing for the better going forward. The life cycle of a movie after production is typically: 

Theaters, on demand/Blue-ray, streaming services, and lastly day time tv.
Box office sales are typically where most of the profit is realized. On demand and blue-ray are worth mentioning, but the second biggest income is obviously stream services renting the rights to have them on their platforms. No matter how you look at this eliminating the box office releases is just throwing away millions in potential profits. It really doesn’t make sense to do that. Especially with this new game changing deal that was recently struck with Universal studios. [Here’s the article ](https://qz.com/1885992/universals-deal-with-amc-is-huge-for-the-movie-industry/)
This basically says that the amount of time for a theatrical release will be weeks instead of months. This deal was actually a power play by AMC where they said they wouldn’t show anymore Universal Studios movies in their theaters if Universal started doing more straight to streaming releases. Obviously there was a compromise reached in the interest of both parties, but it goes to show that a big name like Universal Studios values the box office greatly. Also, this deal opens up so many door for even platforms like Netflix to release their more notable movies in theater first. Netflix has in the past considered theatrical releases but could never agree on the 90 day release timeframe.

Next, I should talk about how AMC’s stock price has fallen so low based off the fact that they were teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Basically, AMC has been selling stock and taking loans to give itself just the smallest amount of runway to keep afloat for another month. Although, now talk of bankruptcy is in the rear view window. This is widely due to you delinquents blowing up their stock’s value. 
[Here’s another arrival on that](https://www.google.com/amp/s/deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/amp/) 
Now they went from having a month or so of runway to enough to last them well into 2021. That’s not to mention a lot of movie deals that are reaching into as far as 2023. 

I might be missing some recent news points, but these factors; along with the fact that vaccines most likely being available to the general public in a few months, gives me a lot of hope for AMC’s future. My DD is pretty bare minimum and fuck if I know if they are viable for a short squeeze? Even if they aren’t I’m sure they will get some attention in the hype if GME still has a chance. None of this is financial advice by the way. All in all I just like the stock.

TLDR, 
1) Block buster movie budgets are $100’s of million and box office revenue is always just going to be extra millions of profit.
2) New movie deals will bring 90 day theatrical release windows to 17 days. Making theaters even becoming approachable for platforms like Netflix.
3) Threat of bankruptcy is pretty much gone. Plenty of runway funding for the future. 
   
Still hold GME, AMC, and BB 💎🙌. Since they told me in college diversification is smart, and I’m a high functioning autistic 🦍. 
See y’all on the 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lexq6t/some_amc_dd_for_the_average/,"I definitely agree with your points.Vaccines are rolling out slowly but surely in all the states which means down the line , movie theatres will rise back to life . What do you think about the HBO Max situation?Thing about the ""Theaters are going the way of arcades/blockbuster"" narrative doesn't get is the major social pressure propping up theatres, and the fact AMC isn't your local art-house student film showcase but a massive corporate chain.

Listen. You are a single person. You are a basic ass astrology believing, sports-watching, budweiser drinking 50-of-100 stat block american.

WHAT ARE THE THINGS?

1. Restaraunts
2. Bars
3. Movies

Anything in those sector that had capital enough to ride it through the last year is gonna ride a wave of collective relief coming out of this pandemic.

That's it. The basic date trifecta. It has remained unchanged for literally hundreds of years through war, famine, and economic collapse. Despite all we lazy millenials doing our netflix-and-chills with avocado toast in the morning and shit, it will remain the basic date trifecta.

It is normalcy, and a normalcy people are ACHING to get back to as vaccines get handed out and people can start feeling like its safe to poke holes in the bottom of popcorn buckets again.

Combine that with the fact that AMC, the size that it is isn't going to pull a blockbuster and go ""nah these new competing technologies are a fad""

They're already pivoting, they'll continue to pivot.

However, it’s impossible to claim this as DD without mentioning the 75% dilution of shares in the past year.The problem is it’s right above its resistance line. It skyrocketed past that awhile ago due to hyped inflation, but without any real major driving factors, its come back down to it’s equilibrium and it’s not likely to break far past that point any time soon.

And didn’t they say their capital raise just prior to the run up would help them stave off bankruptcy into late 2021?

$KO is one of those companies that were hit by the pandemic.

151,Why I’m big on oil,"Back again with the oil DD. Last time was right and got some juicy tendies. 

Short answer: it do go up

Long answer: Many reasons. Oil futures market is in backwardation. I know it’s a long word, but it just means that there is a short/medium term mispricing in the commodity market. Signaling a possible shortage in supply. 
Also, lockdowns are easing, I don’t have to explain to you what this means. 
Also, majority of shares took a beating after earnings report. It does not take a genius to know that stonks only go up. 

But which stock you say? 

RDS. I like it for the long term for various reasons, but it is one of the few oil stocks that has good news in the short term: it has just increased the dividend and made some cute acquisitions. Also, it’s much leaner after the post covid impairments.

We had some crazy ass earnings reports from big tech, again no discussion. And it's not like people aren't posting, there are some posts but they're not getting any traction because we're literally stuck in this GME loop. 

So i ask all of you, new and old gang, to take a break and think what's the way out? We can circle jerk all day and cry about those hedge funds and the media and the manipulation like we've been doing for past two weeks. Or we can start looking for new plays and buy new consoles from GameStop. At least that's a better plan than just simply hoping to pump questionable DD posts to r/all and expecting momentum swing.

Likewise, you can only claim losses on your shares when you sell them. You cannot claim a deduction for unrealised losses

Lastly, it is illegal to sell your shares to realise the losses so you can claim a tax deduction and immediately buy shares back (it's called a wash trade). Don't do this either.

I've seen some stupid comments around here about people using their entire earnings to pay their loans or others claiming tax deductions on losses for shares they still own

Check your countries individual tax laws before spending any money or making any deductions. Calculate your tax obligations before spending a cent. If you can't, either get an accountant to do it or just wait to find out how much you owe.

163,$VSTO DD- A great value play (Vista Outdoors),"**TLDR: Ammo sales/backorders are currently the highest they have ever been, and the market has not reacted yet**

Let me start by saying that I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. However, I am a “gun guy” and regularly shoot a lot (~20,000 rounds a year) and compete in shooting sports (USPSA, 3 gun, Steel Challenge, etc). I hold 100 shares of VSTO as well as 10x Feb 19 $35c and 2x Jun 19 $35c. I plan to buy more shares on any dips below $30, and I will explain why.


Some background:
In case you are as unaware as the cuck analysts on Wall Street apparently are, there is a nationwide gun and ammo shortage. Why do you care? The company Vista Outdoors (VSTO) is publicly traded on the NYSE. VSTO owns the ammo manufacturers Federal Ammunition, CCI, Blazer, Speer, American Eagle, and they just bought Remington’s ammunition plant after they went bankrupt. (imagine going bankrupt during the largest gun/ammo demand period in history, lmao). Besides ammo, they also make primers, brass, and other components. Primers are even harder to get than loaded ammo right now, because the manufacturers are using the primers to service their own needs first. The wide consensus across the industry is that things won’t return to “normal” (i.e. you can walk in a gun store or go online and buy ammo/primers at normal prices) for at least several years. VSTO owns the largest market share of American ammo manufacturing, followed by Winchester (Olin Corporation, OLN).


The fundamentals:
First and foremost, VSTO is a value investment. Some key metrics that make it a buy IMO (taken from ETrade data):

Price to sales: 0.86x (this means you are paying 86 cents for $1 of sales, that’s insane in a cyclical industry)
Price to book: 2.43x
Price to cash flow: 4.64x
And most importantly: Price to earnings. Now, the current number is 33.59x. This is including the quarter from a year/9 months ago where they barely turned a profit (Trump was still president, no coronavirus, no nationwide political unrest, etc).


Looking forward:
Forward P/E is difficult to estimate due to lack of analyst coverage, but if you look at the last two quarters and push forward only six months at the same/similar earnings (approx. $1 per share), you get a forward P/E of 13.5x!!
For the TA retards, if you look at historical charts, you will note that VSTO traded at $44-$50 throughout the tail end of the Obama presidency. Note that those prices were maintained when they were reporting EPS of approx.. 0.60 cents per share. Once Trump was elected and ammo demanded dropped off significantly, the stock price got hammered. (Again, they just reported two quarters in a row of over $1 per share in earnings.)


Ammo demand: according to shooting podcasts and other industry media I follow, Federal alone has over $1 BILLION worth of back orders right now. Other reports state that they currently have more outstanding orders than they got during the ENTIRE 8 year Obama presidency. Do the math for what that will look like once the market picks up on this.
Couple that with that fact that gun sales have been skyrocketing for the last year. New gun owners=more people buying ammo


Risks:
Biden administration passing/signing HR 127 into law, which introduces a shitload of retarded restrictions on ammo purchases by consumers. However, this will cause an even greater near-term spike in demand

Copper and lead prices continue to rise in relation to the inflated dollar (low risk, generally when suppliers raise prices the ammo manufacturers raise their prices too)

These are the reasons I think VSTO is the superior play on the ammo shortage- opposed to OLN, which is a much smaller market share, less profitable, and lower quality ammo in general, and P O W W, which I had never heard of until a week ago, and I still can’t figure out what brands of ammo they actually own (thats a big red flag)",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/levgwx/vsto_dd_a_great_value_play_vista_outdoors/,"Nice write-up brother. I definitely love my guns and ammo. Will keep it in my ""cross hairs."" 😂Wow, kinda almost real DD.I’m not an expert in stocks but I too am a gun guy. I think the major consideration to think about here is that HR 127 and the possible restriction of online ammo sales will hurt the industry far more than the demand will help. Further restrictions are no doubt on the way as well, and I don’t think the demand matters when the businesses involved are getting restricted so much. Again, I know next to nothing about stocks, just an observation.Thanks for writing a solid DD on a stock nobody has heard of instead of GME. It’s nice to see people looking elsewhereGood write up! My father and I picked up some VTSO calls for $35 this last weekI've been bullish on VSTO as of last week when I saw their recent report. It certainly does look very optimistic in their future. Considering how I haven't found ammo for my twice a year desert target practice for a few years, I consider the ammo shortage to be a significant driving power of this stock.

Legislation risk wise I have yet to observe any major ammo restricting legislation getting passed, especially since it is ultra partisan. Moderate gun owners may be more likely to compromise on regulations that don't impact regular target practice/hunting/self defense related activities. Regulation on ammo would certainly be quite difficult to pass considering this, however, it would also be the most effective form of gun control.

All this said I do like your DD and agree with nearly everything you stated. VSTO goes pew pew and I am an investment noobGood pick. VSTO had some nice runs during the summer of love and the capitol fuck fuck games. Solid long hold or leap play.Not a gun guy, but good and well thought out DD. Will look into it!as an aside I just wanna share that I recently got a new Daniel defense ddm4 proFinally VSTO DD!!",1612731742.0,125

It likes to stay around $370-390 then shoots to $420~ around earnings. Super Bowl weekend is gonna cause a spike in sales too. 

Buying calls for the run up is the play here. Their price normally peaks the week before earnings so 2/19 expiry is probably better since it’s cheaper will offer higher returns.

167,"Blackrock, the largest asset manager in the world, increased their ownership of Zynga to 5.2% last week","https://fintel.io/so/us/znga/blackrock

Why is this of note? 

Chinese capital firm Keybanc reported last month that Tencent is raising large amounts of money for a purchase, with Zynga being among the possible targets.

https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/21/01/19255208/update-zynga-shares-see-volume-as-traders-circulate-tmt-finance-report-that-tencent-is-considering-a

Blackrock and Tencent are already working together on ways for Tencent to gain more market share in China.

https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/blackrock-in-talks-with-internet-giant-tencent-over-china-tie-up-20191003

So, why does the 5% matter? 

If you own a single share in a stock, you can have voting rights when it comes to major decisions the company makes. The more shares you have, the more your vote counts. If you own more than 5%, you get special voting rights and a 5% or more share-ownership signifies that the owner intends to be an active participant in the stock, rather than a passive one.

In addition, dark pools have been active on Zynga for months now with large purchases coming in almost daily. For those who don't know about dark pools, this is a quick primer:
 https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp?

I'm thinking Blackrock wants to make sure it gets a say in any decision regarding Zynga and they've been doing it as quietly as possible.

Zynga stock also just happens to have broken above its high of [NINE YEARS.](https://imgur.com/a/6tPWzF1)

172,$DISCA DD,"Alright autists, here is a short and sweet DD for $DISCA.
Discovery holds a bunch of networks women love to watch, like HG TV, Food Network, house flipping and all that. Recently they created their own streaming service (why not) and stock has responded nicely. $DISCA is up 95% in past 3 months. A portion of this is said to be due to short covering among funds (more on that later) but I disagree. GME squeeze has not picked up until mid January, Disca has been ripping since mid November.

Among all free apps in Apple universe, it has been moving between 50th and 100th place for the past couple weeks in downloads, and have been on top 10 rankings for android for a while. 

Trading at a 20 P/E and 7x FCF compared to its competitors you could say its relatively cheap. 

Now here are the catalysts, Michael Bury owns 500k shares of this beauty. I'm sure he did more DD than me, so betting on big fella to find value for me. 
It is the most shorted stock in SP500 and trades at a 50% valuation discount.
Discovery+ went live early January and earnings report is due March 1st, I expect even if they announce mediocre numbers, stock should pick up pace due to low valuation.

As you all are aware, growth expectation is everything in this market. Down is up, up is up, everything makes money.

This customer acquisition cost might affect the next quarters earnings if they cannot rapidly gain paid subscribers. Disney+ had a similar experience but managed to gain sufficient followers to recover customer acquisition costs. Discovery also has the plus of the physical network stream to also produce revenue, the streaming service should just be another potential revenue source for them.

173,AMC GOOD LONG TERM? (Buy/Hold),"Edit: I am aware of the possible squeeze incoming and am already in possession of 7 amc @3.43 I just really UNIRONICALLY like the stock

Edit 2: Someone let me know that I had made a clerical error, 99 billion should have been 9.9 billion

Hello, I have been a lurker of the sub for just over 2 years, this is my first DD so please don't hold back and let me know what my blind spots are.

AMC is currently trading at 6.83 when im writing this and I see it possibly going a little lower but I do believe that ~ 7$ is a good price for this stock considering the rebound it could make in the coming months/years.

AMC and theaters in general are a very important part of American culture, or at least have been for a long time, covid could change all of this I am aware; however I do not believe that hollywood is willing to give up a 9.9 Billion dollar a year industry because someone ate batman. In 2019 theaters generated an estimated revenue of 9.9B this number fell harshly and predictibly due to Covid laws, but their alternative was something no one even considered trying. Paying $30 to watch a movie via a streaming platform... This is something I think even idiots look at and think ""wow this is a rip"", and there is no alternative to this as movie studios simply cannot rely on subscription revenue to create a movie that can survive by todays standards.

One of the major things about theaters that draws people in is the sheer quality of the tech, where as we could spend 10 or 20 thousand on a tv and sound system, these theaters spend that per speaker, for an uncompromised experiance unobtainable at home without cutting edge and expensive technology that is by no means ""popular"" or ""accessible"".

My personal opinion is that AMC will probably climb past the 10$ mark when they can resume normal operation, me and all of my friends have been talking about theaters and how they are in a ""make-it-or-break-it"" scenario, this is probably my biggest worry in terms of this stock, there is a VERY real chance that people will simply not care about theaters after all this is over, but I am counting on Hollywood to not let that happen, I believe they would fight tooth, nail, and every apendage they had to keep theaters in America.

ACTUAL DD:

Old Financials: Prior to COVID-19, AMC had found itself in a small rut of sorts, their overall revenue was only up .19%, they were spending much more on advertisements than usual and they were also dealing with a lower than average operating income (down 48.68% 2018-2019) and they finished out the year in debt, they had lost 149.10M

New Financials: 2020 has been an absolute shit show for AMC, they are down across the board by > 90%, and their last reported operating income in september was -675.40M and the finished the year out 905.80M in the red. Q1 2020 obviously had lessened effects on the company as the US was undecided for a while on how seriously we were going to take it.
Their Gross profits have also fallen:
Q4 (2019): +939.60M - (+3.15%)
Q1 (2020): +616.40M - (-20.32%)
Q2 (2020): +14.20M - (-98.75%)
Q3 (2020): +84.10M - (-89.90%)
It is also worth mentioning their net income across the quarters has went from -149.10M in Q4 2019 to -3.64B Q3 2020

OPINION: I think that AMC is currently in a dangerous predicament in terms of hemmoraging money each quarter, however I do believe that Hollywood has enough of a vested interest to turn this into a possibly money maker. No one is calling for theaters to go away, people like them and they enjoy the atmosphere that comes with the experiance, we love the memes of a 20$ popcorn and a 50$ soda, but I really believe Americans like the cinema.

Position: 20 Jan 23 3.5$ call I belive in AMC long-term (at least for the next few years), I am very much so considering a LEAPs position on AMC, I wouldn't be mad being stuck with 100 shares of AMC, and considering the risk and reward, my breakeven is $8.50, I really believe that sometime between now and 2023 AMC will at LEAST go to 8.50, hopefully higher, but if lower than its DIAMOND HANDS INTO THE GROUND.

TLDR: AMC has issues and its a gamble, but goddamnit I like it

They replied “please hold” i hung up, bought more and gonna continue to hold!!!If Amazon buys it, it’s as good as gold.In all seriousness, the Paramount Decree was just lifted which now allows movie theaters to PRODUCE their own movies and it also allows production companies like Netflix and Disney to own movie theaters. It seems AMC now has options. They can either be acquired or work with production companies such as Netflix. Imagine seeing a Netflix show finale at a theater? Or Disney owning AMC and then sending off all those movies to their Disney+ streaming platform? Lots of new possibilities just acquired.  [This is big breaking news. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/deadline.com/2020/08/paramount-consent-decrees-justice-department-2-1203007221/amp/)I'm never selling mine. I like the stock.This is also to say if you have an insane number of AMC shares and can afford to hold I would, I’m doing that with GME but I truly feel like AMC has more of a future in terms of immediate money (gme needs to reinvent) HELL EVEN AMC COULD REINVENTAmc only has value while people can’t go. They’re reminiscing about the movies but when it was open season, amc was doing poorly and still will when things level out. As the mass vaccinations for regular folks starts, there will be a short period of surge for amc as people flock. This happens with anything you take away for a long period of time. This will slowly fizzle though and amc will go back into the toilet where it’s been for a while. Your best bet is to try to buy at prices prepandemic and wait for that surge and sell. Holding longer than that is foolish imo. This past year has shown film studios that other avenues of releasing a movie are possible and that will drive amc further into the ground than it was previously. Also far less people are going to be buying the 2000% overpriced food at theaters with the economic situation. That’s most of amc’s bread and butter. Hold to ride the post covid rush, not for the financials.Great DD.  The question I ask, is what is stopping “Hollywood “ from finding a new avenue to the consumer?  You say $30 is a lot.  My tight wallet says I just saved $$, AND I can invite my wife’s boyfriend to cut my costs.  Just playing devil’s advocate.  I totally agree there’s 💵 to be made.

This is not financial advice, as I have read Player 1 for the hundredth time and believe that is our future.If the reason to hold amc  is that movie theaters are a part of Americana, and that’s why amc will bounce back( outside of dead cat bounce) , I would junk it. Covid has changed society, which will really fuck with long term investments in general.You should also consider how their balance sheet, i.e. their assets and debts, is still several billion dollars in the negative. While theaters can recover someday, it is possible that AMC goes through chapter 11 bankruptcy first and all stock holders get replaced with the debtholders. Before wallstreetbets blew them up, there were a month or two from chapter 11. Now maybe 6-9 months.  Not financial advice, but please be careful.",1612727933.0,130
174,The sub is divided and you're creating a cult.,"Hey guys, I've been following WSB for years now, but only recently started posting.

I'm worried that the sub is getting divided because of extremists on both sides of the whole GME saga. There's people who have never touched the stock market until 2 weeks ago getting to know a lot of new trendy terms like ""short squeeze,"" ""counterfeit shares,"" learning what a Bloomberg terminal is etc etc. Listen - that's amazing. I love seeing people get educated, especially in this community, because long-term that means loss porn for us.

What I worry about is that BECAUSE people are learning so much, so quickly, they now feel like they're the experts among their friends and are in over their heads. One one of the recent top posts was comparing the GME and AMC charts, saying how similar they were. Everyone in the comments was screaming ""MAHNEEPULASHIONNNNNN."" COULD it have been manipulation? I mean... yes... But market **correlation** is very, very common and normal. I don't think I need to explain this but for those of you who want to understand, feel free to ask. Now, I'm not saying anything about the overall movement of the stocks, as I don't know enough to tell you if it was overall manipulation, but the correlation doesn't mean shit.

PLEASE do your research before posting this shit. This is why the vets are pissed at all the GME pumping: it's in large by people who don't know what they're talking about. Not everyone who's done with GME is a Melvin bot, as much as you'd like to believe. It's all too easy to get caught up in the whole story and feel like every little thing is manipulated against you. I do hold some GME and would love to see it blow up again, but fuck guys, take what you read with a grain of salt. If you have a thesis that you believe in, you should ALWAYS know the bearish case too. Consider what the other side is saying too. You'll either feel more confident (and not need to get your confirmation bias...) or you'll realize maybe you were wrong.

The other side of the story is the OGs who have also been around for years. I see why you're pissed. The sub has changed tremendously over the last month. At the same time, I want you guys to also remember that this GME thing is turning into a cult and the more aggressively you attack these newbies the more you push them to the conspiracy side. It's not exactly the essence of WSB to teach people (lol) BUT if you just leave comments saying ""you're an idiot."" or ""you should have sold like I did retard"" you're only making the problem worse.

If you've been around long enough you know that things will probably go back to normal once we get to a bearish market again. Then we can continue losing money together in peace.

175,"Market inefficiencies, MOASS and you. A discussion of how the market is broken and what it means for us.","So the last 2 weeks have been interesting to say the least for the market. A basket of WAY over shorted retail stocks almost crashed the market, Rh fucked 80% of the sub, and now there is going to be Congressional and regulatory inquiries. So instead of yet another gme go brrrr post, I would rather discuss the long term implications of all this and just how broken the market is. 

There is almost assuredly regulation that will come of this. What that looks like we don't know yet. But because the PDT rule exists I am pretty sure of that. Ironically the rule that is ""meant to protect"" retail definitely cost me more money when I was starting, by trying to avoid strikes, then any crazy yolo's. 

That brings us to the first point to consider. Retail options trading. I am willing to bet large sums of money they're going to come after it. And while there is certainly an increase in retail options trading, do we really have the effect that they will claim we have? Sure it can swing smaller stocks, but its not gonna do a thing to the big boys. Remember how  short lived that was on MSFT? Mass amounts of capital that we couldn't possibly bring to market are needed for that. Softbank did it though, and that was a big dick move, especially because they are Asian and not known for packing schmeat. 

The next point to consider is what actually almost crashed the market. HF leverage. They were getting absolutely destroyed on a handful of heavily shorted stocks to the point it caused the largest alpha unwind in recent history.

&#x200B;

It might make investors feel good to see net $0 on a balance sheet and assume there is no risk. But the reality is there is a gross $30 exposure per dollar because they are levered to the tits. This being wsb, I respect that. But it was not retail that over-levered on crowded shorts that had to unwind longs in a state of sheer panic to cover or close. 

The market did not actually crash this time though, and there is probably some decent upside in going long right now.

Maybe, just maybe its time to keep a closer eye on just how much leverage the HF's and IB's are using? These types of events are happening more often than in the past. The bankers and fund folk love to say that no ones stress tests their book for multiple sigma moves like this. Maybe they should start to because its the 5th such event in 20 years ( dot com, 2008, Volmageddon, covid crash, and now this).

After that I'm not sure. But It'll be a disgrace if they restrict retail options or anything like that.This is the type of shit that happens when you pump 6T in no strings attached Covid Money into Wall Street, with a 0% FED Rate.

Its not if, but when.Im dumb so this is probably all wrong.  

The T+2-3 timeline for delivering shares is dumb and should be shorter. T+13 before “forcing” them to do something is entirely too long.  

Shares that are shorted don’t need to tell the person they are being traded to that they are shorted.  That needs to change, and it needs to be tracked.    

The reporting requirements are outdated and leave windows of opportunity for manipulative behavior to happen and be mostly corrected before noticed. Important short data coming out only twice a month sucks as it is, but then it’s already outdated when it’s released.  

Penalties need to be more severe. They’re a fucking joke.  Every FINRA case I see ends with some minuscule payment compared the benefit their behavior gave them.  For example, they fined a company in December $500,000 for not properly reporting short positions in 800+ million shares.If you think we have raging hard confirmation bias ala diamond hands, imagine how the upper middle class and above feel with their hedges? They will dupe themselves into believing it was us that broke everything and we will get punished for bringing a small sliver of light to the overall situation.

The dot-com bear market was in 2000 and it lasted almost 31 months, 2007-2009 was a 17 month long bear market, and we also had a bear market for 33 days in 2020 due to the pandemic crash. While it wasn’t a prolonged bear market it by definition was a bear market.Its been proven many times that you should just keep investing...no one can predict the market.  The one thing that always happens though is STONKS GO UP over time.  (you even show that in your chart)Stonks do always go up though, retard.Steeping yield curve points to stronger economic recovery.  Since the fed already said over and over they won't raise interest rates and will even accomodate greater than 2% inflation, your bear thesis is only half right.  We are and will recover strong but interest rates won't increase.  Stocks go up on this bull cycle.  Bears lose again.2008 was only 12 years ago. Yes, most of us have lived through a bear market lolThis post is so cringe, sounds like you're 20 years old and just found out what the yield curve is. Many of us have in fact been through bear markets. Many of us don't give a flying fuck about what bonds are doing. NEXT.Lol this guy thinks the gov won't just tape the print button down again, have the markets manipulate other metals to control inflation and add to the deficit.....but all jokes aside I'm fucking scared about the next 11 months I think a big crash is way overdue the markets don't match the people's sentiment and situations. I could be way wrong though cause I am dumb.",1612725871.0,132
178,MAKES WSB GREAT AGAIN WITH SOME $WKHS DD,"Buckle up retards cuz this autist is about to take you on a ride to tendy town. Inb4 you all check my post history and bitch about all my WKHS posts, ya no fucking shit I’m gonna post about a stock I love. Inb4 Inb4 you tinfoil hat wearing GME/AMC fucks attack me, last time I checked there’s more than two stocks on the exchanges. Anyways here goes,

Workhorse group is a Loveland, Ohio EV manufacturer. 100% American Made (insert American Eagle boner gif) and completely electric for all you who value the environment or whatever. I’m sure you’ve all come across it at some point especially when I was the top trending stock for like a week at the end of June/July. As many of you might now, this shitshow of a government we have here in the good ol’ USA is looking to upgrade their self combusting USPS fleet via a NGDV (Next Generation Delivery Vehicle) bidding process for a contract to the tune of approximately 8 billion. When all is said and done, including maintenance and upkeep, the contract in the span of a decade or more is about 20b. This NGDV contract is the “betting” portion of this stock and despite what all the retarded naysayers claim, there is a fuck ton more to WKHS besides this contract. This is the cherry on top so I’m starting top down with this masterpiece. 

Currently, there are three remaining bids from companies involved in this NGDV selection process. Karsan (a Turkish company), Ford/Oshkosh (joint venture), and our beloved WKHS. 

Karsan - I can’t see this winning even a fraction of a percent of the contract due to it not being American. Not because it’s a bad company but if you check the requirements for the companies, they snuck in a clause that mandated 75% American made parts to be selected. Also, Biden, for the better part of his campaign and to this day has been proclaiming that he will be bringing American manufacturing to the forefront again and we will be buying American (something he and Trump miraculously had in common). For this reason, Karsan is seen as a non-factor. 

Ford/Oshkosh - The only realistic challenger to WKHS and only bear case being made against it. Undoubtedly, Ford is as American as it gets. But even more undoubtedly, they are shitty and unreliable as fuck. Millions of recalls on Ford vehicles in the past and present. Another big issue with this is that Biden was “zero-emission”. The prototype submitted for the proposal was a hybrid and not fully EV. For this reason, I think Ford receives a portion of this contract no greater than 25%. Another reason I think they’ll get only a minor stake in this is because their prototype does indeed actually fare better in rural routes where charging stations just aren’t all that practical or possible. 

The whole NGDV process has been going on for about 6 years and there’s no surprise that this inefficient government has been unable to wrap the process up at this point and then Covid took over. Yes there have been delays to the contract award as recently as October 2020. In a letter/memo addressed to the USPS Board of Governors, they were urged to not further delay this process as with the current degradation of the existing fleet, doing so would harm the project altogether and further complicate the process of removing these shitboxes that have been around since ‘87. With Covid being the last excuse to delay, and the vaccine now being rolled out, I DO NOT foresee another stalling of the process. 

Another reason WKHS is my favorite in this race is that DeJoy’s current philosophy on the USPS is to cut costs and to have the entity become for cost efficient. In case you haven’t noticed, ICE vehicles are much more costly to run and maintain that a 100% EV vehicle. Fewer parts means fewer problems and much less maintenance and repair costs. Also, in their recent financial statements, the USPS had requested a 600% increase in their infrastructure spending. I don’t see too many post offices crumbling to the ground, so this can only mean they’re gearing up to install a metric fuck ton of charging stations. By going fully EV, billions will be saved over time by the post office, an entity that’s currently burning cash like it’s their fucking job. 

THE LAST DELAY IN THE NGDV SLATES THE CONTRACT TO BE AWARDED FISCAL 2021 Q2 WHICH MEANS JANUARY-MARCH 2021. 

Enough about the contract though, let’s talk other aspects. WKHS is currently partnered with UPS in testing by out their fleet and also more importantly their drone delivery capabilities. WKHS currently owns the patents to vehicle borne drone launching technology. This isn’t talked about enough. Many people think the future of this company hinges on that shitshow of a contract when in reality the really exciting part is this drone tech. It would be extremely helpful and useful in efficient package delivery especially when there’s a whole fleet management system capabilities that the company offers. As the autonomous tech and drones sector begin to grow exponentially, WKHS has a head start on it (the commercial delivery aspect). 

Institutional holdings lies at almost 50%. The big boys and big girls (BAE Cathie Wood) are in on the company and they are in heavy. My wife Cathie must be seeing something in the future of this company if she’s grown her holding to over 2.2m shares and she’s not gonna throw some money into a gamble on a fucking government contract. 

Many claim that production is an issue but this is more a scare tactic than an actual issue. Sister company Lordstown Motors (Ticker: Ride) is led by former WKHS CEO. They have offered their factory, which has the capability to pump out about 600k vehicles a year, if WKHS needs it. Important to note that WKHS has a 10% stake in Lordstown and will receive royalties on the first 100k Endurance EV pickup trucks that Lordstown sells. So there’s another form of revenue the company has going for it. 

It’s a growth stock with a lot of potential and it’s logistically gearing up to grow. Received 200m financing from an institutional Investor during the late summer/early fall, and it entered into an agreement with Hitachi, to be assured in the logistics of the company. Hitachi is a pretty serious company to be partnered with unless you plan on slinging out vehicles. Most recently, a 6,320 truck order came in from Pritchard which totals around 250m give or take a few bucks. This is all while IKEA a company that aims to go fully electric by 2025 is testing out a fleet of WKHS C1000 vehicles. 

Connect the fucking dots and join the ride fellow autists. I’ve been long WKHS since January of 2020 and there’s plenty of room to run. High risk high reward with this growth stock but that’s why we’re all here right? 

Positions - 1000 shares, 11x $60c 2/12 (USPS BOG meeting Tuesday so these are scratch off lottos basically), 5x $60c 2/19 (see previous calls), 11x 45c 4/16. 

Let’s ride this horse to tendy town fellas 🤝

Edit: I’m a retard blah blah blah THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I JUST LOVE THIS STOCK  blah blah blah

EDIT 2 - WKHS vehicles are being showcased at the super bowl as Pritchard is using WKHS trucks to take people to and from the super bowl and various surrounding locations. Essentially they are marketing themselves by providing shuttle services.

Edit 3 - WKHS is currently at about 30% short sold so a contract announcement in their favor will easily rocket this to 100+ as shorts scramble to cover. It sneaky made the list of highly shorted stocks.

Edit 4 - 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (FOR THE VISUAL LEARNING RETARDS)

Edit 5 - TLDR: WKHS is 100% American made EV Last Mile Delivery Vehicle. Has Patents pending for its drone delivery tech. Frontrunner for USPS 8.2b+ Government Fleet Contract (NGDV Contract). Heavy institutional ownership including BAE Cathie Wood. 30% Short Float to be squeezed on contract announcement.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/letekr/makes_wsb_great_again_with_some_wkhs_dd/,"This is good shit.I bought 100 shares of WKHS at $10.11 and 300 shares of RIDE at an average of $19.

183,Pumps and Dumps and Chumps,,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/opinion/gamestop-stocks.html,"> In a more reasonable world, hardly anyone would care about the ups and downs of a smallish retailer’s stock price. Even near the top of its Reddit-fueled roller coaster, GameStop accounted for only about 0.06 percent of the total value of U.S. stocks. Furthermore, the stock market itself is mainly a sideshow to the real economy.

> But we don’t live in a reasonable world, we live in a world where the GameStop story briefly commanded global attention. And the craziness did offer some important lessons — not so much about economics and markets as about psychology and politics.

184,"I just read the DD on WSB $GME misinformation, I still think it can moon but... $AMC 👀","So I just read the detailed posts about $GME DD and I saw a few of you join in on the discussion with a thought that’s certainly crossed my own mind more than once. The specific part of the discussion I’ll highlight is *whether or not hedge funds or others in power manipulated the market by influencing the closure of trades on platforms such as Robinhood*. Like many of you, I almost immediately believed that this was a direct attack on retail to prevent any astronomical effect on $GME, but later changed my stance to the following and see that many of you share this stance too, based on your own DD: 

*the attack was never meant to prevent $GME from exploding, $GME was a distraction from the true threat, $AMC* 

Now before you downvote I will say that I still think $GME had potential to reach new heights based on my own DD, and it has nothing to do with the “177% float” we’re not exactly sure about. However, I personally believe $AMC has more practical long term potential. It was almost certain $AMC would be going out of business, which was good news for a lot of shorts—a no-brainer, if you will. The success of the $GME squeeze scared the funds into avoiding a part 2 at all costs, $AMC surpassing ~$30 and staying there would be in direct contrast to so. many. short. positions. Now, I’m sure a lot of you (if not most of you) are more experienced, more talented, smarter traders than myself, but this remains common sense to me which is why I still maintain this opinion: at a time (covid) when theaters were ghost towns, the end wasn’t even remotely in sight, and the theater industry already in decline—when theaters were arguably at an all time low, imagine what might happen if the stock price was virally launched into heights unseen since A YEAR before the pandemic. Based on the simple principals of trading I was introduced to, I’m inclined to believe this would destroy many, many plans and have a historical affect on the price of an $AMC share.

Tell me if I’m wrong through, tell me I’m missing something. Tell me that $6.00 isn’t a killer deal for what might be the most undervalued stock of the year, amidst an already crazy year. Please, someone convince me not to put a... *thrilling*... amount of money on $AMC at open. I want to be wrong so you save me the time I’ll spend on this subreddit and Twitter these next few months.

People are going to be excited to go to movies when they can, but the power of meme marketing alone isnt going to be enough to save this industry against Netflix, HBO, etc....

I'd love to see it pop again, and still hold positions. But I would not necessarily say its the safest place to put a ""thrilling"" amount of money.

Just my opinion, best of luck :)I price current fair value of AMC at 12.00 because an egg carton has twelve eggs and totally not because of debt restructuring, potential deals in the works, and signs of post Covid recovery on the horizon (easing of restrictions, complaints of vaccine distribution, money in consumer pockets). 12 eggs. Sometimes you can get those egg megapacks with 24 eggs. Harder to find but possible!I agree with you. I’ve also read a few DD’s tonight about how $AMC could be acquired due to some law expiring.

187,"Retard apes, I hereby present you the #1 Stock of 2021 ---- RDFN","Fellow autists,

You heard it here 1st. Redfin will be the #1 stock of 2021.

That's right, that shitty red website that your wife's bf keeps browsing while he hogs your shitty Wi-Fi (cause you can no longer afford the premium on decent internet service due to GME losses) is gonna be the gangbuster stock of 2021.

Why? As if you degenerates needed reasons but F it here we go.

1. The covid-so-work-from-home BS is going to unleash the biggest transformation in Real Estate ever seen in this country. As more people exit high priced SF, NY, Seattle, etc since their work no longer requires them to be physically there, many renters in those cities now find themselves in a position to be BUYERS in another city. That means a huge net gain of buyers as people from $3000/month RENT to $1600/month MORTAGE payment, most of them aged 25-35
2. Netflix, Tesla, Amazon should all have taught you this by now: the stocks that do well in the *medium* term are no longer the ones with the best financial metrics but the ones that are most popular among millenials and Gen Z. The ones people see on a daily basis and names get thrown around in Zoom meetings. Redfin is the Netflix of real estate due to its amazing website, customer engagement and disruptive fee schedule (who the F wants to pay 3.5% to sell their home when you can pay 1.5%? I sure don't)
3. Traffic to Redfin is skyrocketing. For those genius apes capable of interpreting a super simple graph here it is: [https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/redfin.com#section\_traffic](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/redfin.com#section_traffic) You get what means, retards? From 660 to 460s is a FKING huge jump at those levels. Now let's compare with their main ""competitor"" Zillow [https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/zillow.com#section\_traffic](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/zillow.com#section_traffic) See that? ZERO fking growth over the same period. Yeah Zillow site is ranked higher but that's cause boomers are still alive, the company is worth 5x more than RDFN and still has a lot of legacy crap. Do you want to invest in a company whose main growth comes from internet and sees their traffic growing ZERO over unprecedented stay at home months? I don't.
4. Valuation: can you believe the single biggest growth story of 2021 is ONLY priced at $8 billion right now?! Holy fuking shizzle, Batman! That's right. The website your wife keeps sending you home listings you can't afford after the GME losses is only worth $8 billion. That's like 2x Gamestops right now. Or 1/2 a Gamestop if you bought at $250 and still holding like a true retarded hero.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Sold a f ton of puts on  Jan 22 and used the proceeds those to buy 85, 90 and 120 calls expiring in Jan 22. Price target for 2021 is $400. Dead serious here. Or for you Papa Elon fans, $420 and funding secured.

at first glance, this already looks played.Didn’t read I’m buyingI'm using them to sell my house. That app is catnip for women. Their email notifications are AI driven or some shit b/c every time I pick a new place to live (browse homes) it hits me up 0.000002 seconds later with some nice ass house out of my price range. I am going to follow your non-financial advice and buy some LEAPs mondayThe point about buying further away from cities is actually very on point. My wife and I moved up from the peninsula to wine country due to not ever having to go back to the office. We bought last may and then in July a house 3 doors down sold for 150k more than ours in less than a week. The house has a way shittier layout and yard than ours too. The buy market is going nuts right now, especially in non redneck trailer areasI bought my house through redfin. They even had a virtual house tour which I liked a lot. Its what helped seal the deal as well. I seen the house looked better than the pics. Other sites have nice looking pictures of the house but in person the house doesn't look as good but the virtual tour feature helped with that.[deleted]The stock really struggled post IPO pre-pandemic.

I remembered seeing when the stock was $20 that if they just added ads to their app it was instantly a 5 billion dollar company. They still haven’t resorted to spam. 

They also control they entire process, financing, inspection, repairs. Old school realtors recommend painters in exchange for a fruit cake or event tickets, RDFN is different.  They will eventually see this directly on their bottom line.So, why Redfin and not Zillow?Can I just buy it or do I need to do the options thing that I have no idea what it is and when I read about my dick falls off.",1612723174.0,67

189,If Amazon buys AMC we're going interstellar.,"Sorry that you GME'ers got burned by manipulation. Hedgefunds can do all kinds of shady shit under the table and probably ""legally"" exited their positions in ways that we didn't even know were possible. They're all buddies at the top and you can be that they're not going to lose anymore than they have.

There are rumors floating around that Amazon will buy AMC, this is probably a good business move because after covid chan's wraith, people will want to go out and do stuff again. We're going to see a resurgence in malls, restaurants, bars, but especially movie theaters. The vast majority of people live in shitty little condos and going to the movies will make us feel normal again.

You could maybe risk GME like a total fucking idiot, but I think AMC is the play.

What use do they have for a physical theater when they have a streaming service?this was a rumor 6 months ago too.. go back to StocktwitsHonestly, this has got to be the most retarded Rumor of 2021.

It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, unless of course you're holding AMC and want it to be true.As awesome as it would be—this is pure bullshit.

193,Rocket Companies (RKT) DD - An Undervalued Gem,"Disclaimer: I am long RKT. This is not financial advice, and I am not receiving any compensation whatsoever from anyone for this post. I’m not a professional, I’m not even an amateur, this is a Wendy’s.

**Sources used:** RKT investor relations website and company website, RKT earnings transcripts, SEC fillings, the SEC EDGAR database, sea king al pha, whalewisdom, finbox, yahoo finance, stockcharts, openinsider, Zacks, google sheets.

**Summary**

Rocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.

* RKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future
* RKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.
* The RKT “ecosystem” provides a “full cycle” solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it’s an app, it’s online, it’s doable from home and it’s not complicated. There’s an inherent advantage in what they’re doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that’s complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there’s a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.
* RKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.
* RKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).
* RKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they’re doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That’s a unique and potent combination in my opinion.
* RKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That’s an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.

**Key Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company**

The average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share. 

This estimate gives a forward-looking P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, *even compared to the financial/mortgage sector*. What’s key here is, I don’t think that’s really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups. 

Let’s assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. **That would put its fair value** ***right now*** **at $57.75 per share.** I think it’s worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it’s really only worth whatever the market will pay for it. 

**Key Point - Catalysts**

This thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I’m buying shares, I’m selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don’t know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.

Supporting information and background follows.

**The Business**

RKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:

*Home Financing*

* Rocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent “public facing” part of the Rocket ecosystem.
* Amrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as “supporting infrastructure” to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop. 
* Amrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The “business end” in my simple understanding of the world. 
* Nexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.
* Lendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada
* Edison Financial - Basically the “front end” of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.

*Home Sale and Search*

* Rocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.
* For Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it’s absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.

*Auto & Personal Financing*

* Rocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.
* Rocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.

*Media*

* Core Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.
* Lower My Bills - this company is basically a “portal” business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.

*Services & Technology Development*

* Rock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.
* Rock Central - I will generalize this as “business support”. HR, administration, etc.
* Rocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.

**Recent Acquisitions**

RKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA\_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT\_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv)) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they’re the ones leading that charge.

**Management**

I do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list for 17 consecutive years.

**Financials and Growth**

When it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don’t want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here’s a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:

$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth. 

From that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected. 

Net income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.

Closed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.

Net rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).

RKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion. 

That’s awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with **$3.5B cash on hand**. That’s great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.

RKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.

Quick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They’ll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don’t love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.

Ok so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I’m not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It’s nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:

[https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr](https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr)

**I don’t believe that fair value estimate for an instant**, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it’s also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.

**Product Channels**

RKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don’t lie:

* Direct-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)
* Partner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)
   * Adjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)

The partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.

**Current Market and outlook**

Right now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html))

I cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.

Here’s some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.

It is very easy to notice that the spikes in volumes for GME are not even remotley close to the spikes in NIO. On the period I considered the maximun daily volume for GME, which occures on the 22/Jan/21, is just the 45% of the NIO's maximum daily volume of 577,185,100.

Also, considerind the maximum 3-day rolling sum of volumes GME is just the 41% of the NIO's above 1 bln exchanged shares.

Computing percentage variations as LN(volumes\_d/volumes\_d-1) GME shows the maximum peak on 314% but above NIO of only 43% and not even in the hottest days of January 2021, but  around October 2021.

Is it true that RH had to deal with huge volums of trading activity in GME?

There was no such risk with Nio, so RH could handle Nio's volume fine. RH didn't have the capital to support massive trading on GME. The number of GME shares being traded alone wasn't the issue with RH, it as the number of GME shares + the increased capital requirements to settle GME trades.

200,$USAC is a good short and long term play,"USAC is facilitates the transport and processing of natural gas and crude oil production. With the economy opening up after COVID, there's no way there won't be a surge in the need for oil. This is even more true for natural gas which is used in energy production, giving USAC a solid boost.

At present, USAC is trading below $15, where before the start of the pandemic it was trading at highs of around 18, representing about a 20% gain. The stock has had steadily increasing profit margins over the last 3 years, increasing despite the pandemic, from -96% to 5%. The stock has had its dividends increase over the past 3 years as well, and now provides a relatively stable dividend yield of 14.05% per annum.

From a technical standpoint the stock is quite strong. It has good upward momentum and has recently broken above its 20 day moving average (maroon). The ichimoku cloud is currently below the price and green (lead 1 (light green) is above lead 2(red)), and the lagging span (dark green line) is above the price, suggesting strong support for continued upward movement of the stock in the future.

I would argue that this stock is a relatively good short and long term play. It's good for playing short term recovery of the stock to pre-pandemic highs. It's also good for playing on the massive influx of energy demand once things start to return to normal, with the support of good momentum on its side. In the long run, boomers could even make decent profits from the growing dividend yield of this stock.

[http://www.usacompression.com/](http://www.usacompression.com/)

TLDR; USAC is a natural gas and energy stock currently selling 20% below pre-pandemic highs, that also offers good dividends (stable 14.05% yield). Good prospects based on increased energy consumption once the economy reopens.

I saw GME spiking and put in a sell order far under the real-time price ... $20 below the then-current price, just to make sure the trade would happen and I could be done with it. 

That was the moment that Robin Hood restricted buying.  So even though Fidelity didn’t restrict trading, the RH incident shut down my part of the market too because suddenly demand plummeted.

Dodgy broker of the decadeIt’s more difficult because it deals with opportunity cost and estoppel.

What you have to be able to prove is that you had expected a service, like the ability to buy and sell, you relied upon that expectation, you put the order in below the price during the period when the bad actor took action that made the normal result impossible.

You don’t have to get into intention, all you have to prove is that it was reasonable to sell during this time and actions of the bad actor resulted in the failure.

209,Blatant Mistakes in Almost All of WSB's DD Over the Past Week,"There have been quite a few posts over the past 2 weeks claiming some absurd things with very little proof. 






Almost all of these posts make huge mistakes that debunk their whole argument. It's really unfortunate to read an essay of what the OP claims is DD and then realizing that the OP didn't spend 5 minutes making sure the claims he's making make sense or are accurate. So here is my attempt to debunk the big posts. I won't be spending too much time on any one post. Usually the posts have dozens of little mistakes and addressing them all will take hours. So I'll just cover the main problem of each.  






**Number 1: ""15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight)""**




>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laferl/15_usca_78i_the_illegality_of_short_ladder/





This is the biggest thread about it but any post the mentions a ""short ladder attack"", ""ladder attack"", or ""short attack"" fall into this. ""Short ladder attacks"" and ""ladder attacks"" are NOT real and are not a term you see anywhere other than WSB and a single SeekingAlpha post by a crazy person. Short attacks are real but literally everyone on WSB is using the word incorrectly. It means something completely different from how it's being used.




This is what a short attack is:







>https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/11/27/short-activism-the-rise-in-anonymous-online-short-attacks/











>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp 






Just shorting a stock a lot is NOT a short attack. Actual examples of short attacks are Citron's ""research"" which scares investors into selling their stock. You can even view Bill Ackman's short of Herbalife as an attempted short attack since he was public about it which made investors fearful (temporarily). This has not occurred with GME recently. Obviously Citron was shorting it for a bit but the claims of short attacks have been much more recent than that. None of these claims talk about what was occurring weeks ago with Citron because when they say ""short attack"" they mean something completely different from the actual definition. 





Also, the trading strategy that people talk about when mentioning a ""short ladder attack"" or ""ladder attack"" does NOT even work. Think about for even a second. For this type of price manipulation to happen you need either do it to a stock with almost no volume or you need to trade enough to be responsible for almost all the volume. For the last 2 weeks the lowest daily volume for GME has been 40 million. With many days having a volume double that. So, the first possibility is out. The second possibility assumes that hedge fund are willing to trade BILLIONS of dollars of stock back and forth on a daily basis. That makes 0 sense but let's say that's true just for the argument. The goal of this supposed strategy is to artificially lower the price. Most hedge funds did not short GME and have no reason to allow this strategy to happen. If BILLIONS (or millions) of dollars of the stock are traded at artificially low then the rest of Wall Street would just buy these shares and make a profit. Thus, moving the price back to equilibrium. It is impossible to manipulate a stock price with this strategy if the volume is this big. 






**Number 2: ""GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze""**






>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/








>I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. ~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.








I've already explained what short attacks mean so this is a perfect example of a completely incorrect usage of the word.









~~Also, the site the OP linked shows shares that are available TO BE borrowed. It does not show when shared ARE borrowed. So, it actually shows the opposite of what OP thought it did. Which means his whole argument is incorrect since it depended on this to make any sense.~~





~~I go more in depth about that here:~~
~~https://ns.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float/gmaru31/~~



**EDIT #4 - 7PM: The second part of my argument is incorrect. I assumed the website worked in a way that it doesn't. I only realized this after tinkering a bunch. If you're interested in exactly why I was confused here's a link to a discussion I had which made me realize my mistake:**

**Number 3: ""Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not.""**







>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/







Short interest does not change when short-sellers hedge with options. Short interest is the number of shares sold short divided by the number of shares outstanding. Buying an options contract does not just change either part of that equation. Short-sellers can hedge with options and lessen/eliminate their losses from their shorts but this does not change short interest at all. The OP has a fundamental misunderstanding of finance. 











**Number 4: ""https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/""**









>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/









Again, an incorrect understanding of short attacks. The SeekingAlpha post linked is a literal conspiracy theory as is the ""CounterfeitingStock"" website. There is a reason why it the ONLY website claiming what it does and does so without any proof. We do not know the author or their background/credentials. The thousands of academics that study markets have never talked about or written a paper about ANYTHING the website or the SeekingAlpha post claim. It was given 0 attention for years until WSB found it and now posts about it every 2 seconds without ever reading the contents of it. It is the equivalent of a 9/11 or JFK conspiracy website.   








Also, the OP claims that malicious naked shorting occurred. There is 0 evidence of this. Nobody that has a background in economics or finance believes this. Just the conspiracy theorists on Reddit. Does it naked shorting occur? I'm sure to some extent it does. Does it occur on a level that has an impact on markets? Nobody has evidence of that and there are a few papers on it. Did it occur here and was it malicious? No reason to believe that it occurred on a large scale or that it was malicious. 












**Number 5: ""How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's 69.75 Million Outstanding""**



>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/




Of all the posts I've included this is the only one that has an OP that isn't making blatant mistakes off the bat. Not that there aren't mistakes. But, they're MUCH more forgivable than the others. 








OP's whole argument depends on the FINRA short volume numbers being correct. However, they are not and FINRA even warns for people not to use them to as a proxy for short interest. The numbers include any time a firm decides to sell its own shares so that it can fill a customer's sell order easier. This is relatively common so you can't use these numbers to show actual short positions. This is why the numbers are so off  compared to any third party estimate. I talk more about this problem here : https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/gmfoih1/
























**Number 6: ""GME FLOAT 177%. Apes with the Bloomberg terminal please keep us updated with the numbers.""**












>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leby2i/gme_float_177_apes_with_the_bloomberg_terminal/










So, there's actually not anything directly wrong with the OP since it's just a post of a Bloomberg terminal. The problem is that its obvious that the OP as well as everyone commenting assumes that ""177% of float held"" means the same as ""177% short interest"". This is obviously a very weird mistake to make. It doesn't mean that short interest is 177%. It means that intuitional investors own 177% of float of GameStop. Which is something completely different. Obviously there is a reporting error because institutional investors don't actually own 177% of all outstanding shares. The reasons for this are explained here: 




>https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp#:~:text=There%20are%20instances%20where%20investors,from%20short%20selling%20between%20investors.









**Number 7: ""S3 Partner's ""S3 SI% of Float"" Metric is Total Bullshit and Here's Why""**





>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbydkz/s3_partners_s3_si_of_float_metric_is_total/








I explain why this post and posts like it about S3's data is completely in this post towards the bottom: https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5b8i/updated_short_interest_numbers_for_gamestop_gme/






Basically WSB confused the short interest calculation with S3's own short interest calculation. They have always done both and have always reported both while labeling them correctly. WSB confused the two and thought that S3 had changed the way they were calculating short interest. This never happened. They have always calculated short interest the same way. 






**Number 8: ""It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers""**




>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4c62/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/




The original post was removed but I've seen it reposted a bunch. If I find one with the original text I'll link it. Anyway, I talk about the mistakes of this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgn9a/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/gm66hgf/




**There are plenty more posts that are completely wrong or misinformed. But, I already spent 1-2 hours typing this out so I'm done for now. I'll get on later to answer any questions if any come up.**





TLDR: Almost every single post that makes claims about the markets, data, or GME do not know what they're talking about. These posts have many mistakes and don't ever have an argument that makes logical sense. Do not believe any post on WSB unless you actually did the work and researched everything an OP claims. Including me.









**EDIT #1 - 2:45 PM: Here are is a bit more info on failure-to-delivers and naked shorting:**








>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmhufze/.











>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling









>A study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2014, found no evidence that FTDs ""caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis"". Researchers studied 1,492 New York Stock Exchange stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, and found that ""greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales.""








To clarify: Naked shorting occurs and causes failure-to-delivers. However, there are many other causes. A high number of FTD's does not mean any illegal naked shorting occurred. The point I'm trying to make is that there is no reason to believe that something shady has occurred with GME in terms of abusive naked shorting.





The FTD's should be investigated just to make sure. But, I don't think a large amount of FTD's is evidence of abuse.

>the site the OP linked shows shares that are available TO BE borrowed. It does not show when shared ARE borrowed. So, it actually shows the opposite of what OP thought it did. Which means his whole argument is incorrect.

Image in question: https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg

The image shows availability of shares decreasing substantially throughout that window of time. I'm fairly certain this image *does* show what OP from that thread says it showed. Sure it may not say ""These were shorted"" but it also definitely says ""These are no longer available because someone borrowed them already."" I think claiming that this pedantry invalidates the argument is a pretty bit fucking leap. It seems akin to saying someone's argument is invalid because they spelled ""you're"" wrong.In your linked post:

> It have been explained a thousand times why brokerages restricted buying. There is nothing criminal about it. There's nothing shady about it.

You're saying there was nothing shady about RH or other brokerages restricting buying that Thursday.  One thing that reinforced my belief that there WAS something shady was that billionaire Steve Cohen literally tweeted that night ""Rough crowd on Twitter tonight. 
 Hey stock jockeys keep bringing it"".

Seriously.  What kinda fucking psychopath taunts retail like this if they didn't want to gloat about the fact they got knee capped.I posted a very delta-neutral post on Fails to Deliver, and wrote an entire paragraph on the end about how the odds were against retail on GME. I then got HUNDREDS of comments saying “Thank you for giving me the courage to hold! The hedge funds will never recover!” There’s definitely a cult attitude on this sub, and a whole lotta dumb money (I include myself in the latter).this post is basically just 

""this guy posted a wall of text, but he's actually wrong because i said so""

there really isn't any debunking going on here just more claims that you're right and they're wrong without any backingSir, this is the unemployment line.This idiot says 177% of float being owned by institutions has nothing to do with shortselling and proceeds to post a link explaining exactly why it has everything to do with short selling.

This is 4.5% of the assets under management ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance\_Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies))

If investors are pulling out of one of the most successful hedge funds of all time, which had annualized returns of 60% for decades, what are they doing with their funds at other funds? Where are they going to put their money? 

Is this a sign that money is being moved out equities entirely by institutional and other investors? Or was Renaissance uniquely impacted by the Coronavirus crash, which they say caused their worst ever year in 2020? 

Renaissance is perhaps the most celebrated hedge fund of all time and its annualized returns are practically unbelievable. It's hard not to interpret a nearly 5% loss in AUM as a bad sign for equities.

218,"GME, Mob Mentality, and the irresponsibility of Reddit hype.","

This isn't new, but the extremes have moved significantly.  Never before have I seen so many people lose so much out of sheer ignorance. 

**First and foremost I want to establish a fact: Short squeezes are not permanent.**

I made a post a week ago telling everyone that short squeezes were not permanent.  GME opened at over $300 that day.  By Friday it would close at $63.  The mechanics of a short squeeze make this an inevitability.  They are, by definition, a short term event fueled by a sudden spike in demand, an unsustainable spike in demand driven by short covering.  That demand is necessarily going to end.  So, when you see a stock skyrocket from the 20s to over 300 in the matter of a week taking a long position is a less constructive use of your money than just burning cash for heat.

**What this isn't: an ""I told you so"".**

  I don't really care about that.  The red on the ledger is enough for people to eventually learn they were wrong.  Sure, they'll grovel about conspiracies for a bit, Janet Yellen called Vlad and told him to fuck the retail investors.  Hedge funds had a ""short ladder attack"" (for why that's not a rea, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/) or [here](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qdq0y5b79rzb/Wallstreetbets-Conspiracy-Theorists-Claim-a-Short-Ladder-Attack-Brought-Down-GameStop-Short-Sellers-Have-No-Idea-What-They-re-Talking-About).  They'll claim that the DTC intentionally stopped out retail order flow, despite retail orders being [net sells](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop) for most of this endeavor.  Whatever, so you're going to see a lot of blame on anything but the fact that it's obviously not smart to go long at the top of a goddamn short squeeze.  This is the financial equivalent of doing 150MPH on a dirt road then blaming the tires, the loose gravel, the 2mph headwind, or interstellar radio waves altering your tire pressure when you crash.  No, you shouldn't have been doing 150MPH on a dirt road. 

_______

**What this is: reflecting on the mob**

The shameful part of this is that in your foaming at the mouth rabid need to believe in this story you downvoted and ridiculed anyone who brought up risks, you attacked news agencies who called it irresponsible, you barraged threads and subreddits with hype posts.  For the first time in this sub's entire history we actually had to restrict posting

I spoke with a reporter for a major publication working on this story, and he relayed that he recently interviewed a homeless man who bought three shares at $315 hoping to get himself out of poverty.  do you know how much $945 can do for a homeless person??  There's [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la3bft/emotional_involvement_has_never_been_this_high/glob1kf/?context=3), where a disabled man on government support hopes to build a house with GME gains, again buying in near the top.  These are two examples, but there are hundreds if not thousands more.

20 year old middle class kids blowing their beer money for the month on GME doesn't bother me.  who cares.  But these are people who cannot afford to  a few hundred dollars.  These are setbacks that could have equated to months worth of food, new wardrobes, necessary medical attention, etc. 

We can never prevent those in poor financial situations from making poor decisions, but we can and absolutely should hold ourselves to the standard that we will at least not foster an environment that encourages poor decisions.  Many of you will lay blame elsewhere, but if you downvoted a post discussing risks of GME, accused someone of being a shill, encouraged someone to buy without first understanding their situation, etc. then you are culpable here.  

------

**You can, but should you?**

Much has been said about Reddit's ability to affect the outside world, and now just like with the Boston bombing everyone dove in head first without bothering to examine the risks, the drawbacks, the losses, and the ramifications for those who can't afford them.  

**So, what did Reddit accomplish here?**

Ultimately, nothing aside from transferring a lot of retail wealth to institutional funds, again.  Sure, we can jerk off all day to Melvin's down month.  Perhaps they were hedged and they'll have a monster January, perhaps they were not.  But all of the other funds that took the long end of this early on, with managers that understood the aspects of short squeezes - they bailed out in the 200-300 range selling some to short and some to unwitting retail investors engaged in a fervent and ultimately useless battle against some imaginary foe.  

This wasn't social justice, it wasn't some populist uprising, and I don't care how much AOC, Ted Cruz, Mark Cuban, or the Pope wants to dogpile in on this.  There was nothing that happened here aside from a bunch of retail traders who didn't know what they were doing encouraging a whole lot of other retail investors who couldn't afford it to give away money they didn't have to institutions.  

Next time y'all want to effect change just have a charity drive for UNICEF, or send money to a PAC focused on fighting inequality.  Write your senator, picket congress (peacefully, no mob bullshit), organize a sit in, whatever.  But let's not encourage broke people to give their hard earned thousands to hedge funds.  

**And most importantly, the next time this happens, because it will happen again, for the love of shitt try to understand what the fuck is going on before jumping on the hype train.  And stop downvoting and ridiculing people that do understand what is happening with an opinion you don't like.**

I was devastated because that amount meant a lot for me as a college student.

The fault was mine because of greed but it was never a decision I would have normally made and I always judged myself as rational.

I trusted WSB and the echo chamber effect was working crazily well with people shouting how it will go to the 800-1500 to even 5000 range. 
Then the robinhood ban came and everyone here, all the top threads were acting as if they were all under a united cause. 
I wasn't new here.  I was here for two months or so and didn't FOMO'd into GME, sincerely believed it would make me money and the DDs posted here.

But then the drop came and the stages of grief started to manifest all around.
I learnt an expensive lesson and that is that WSB can actually be helpful but most of the time, the people here will screw you financially because most of them here don't really have an idea either.
They are equally clueless as me but a lot more irresponsible, willing to support and push narrative in order to feel as part of a tribe while not critically thinking.

It was naivety and a rookie mistake that cost me. I thought I was part of a change. 
But it was a good lesson.
I'll work my way back up to 30k eventually. 
Slowly and surely while keeping in mind that by default everyone here is out to get you and exceptions, along with actually smart and competent people here, are pretty rare.

The narrative that changes in this subreddit in a couple of days after dipping was astounding. The mods, the vets, the new people all changed side so quickly it was almost unbelievable.
There is no willpower in this sub save for a few that really believes. 
The people who moderate this sub seemingly only cares about virality and have zero concern about how posts can affect and potentially end the lives of others.
And the users who you KNOW they KNEW either want to enjoy taking the higher I told you so ground and flip it to the other side or gave no shit about everyone else when they cashed out earlier. Despite shitting all over the fundamentals and having no belief in the company, they have no qualms letting everything and everyone burn to the ground despite already cashing out, knowing full well that millions of newcomers and starry eyed people are throwing their savings away.

I know this is a casino but WSB is actually worse because at least in a casino, the players at the table don't manipulate and isn't out to get you. 

This place is jacked up on emotions which is literally the one thing you don't want to be when playing stocks. It's also a good case study to see how masses can be manipulated.

Ironically, this ""mission"" to do good for the middle and lower class people was one that did more harm to them than Melvin Capital ever could.I made 70k In two weeks trading game.all you fuckers worried about game holders. Many of us still made a ton of money. Show us your best return on one trade. Fucking trollsThe only comment from OP in here I don’t agree with- “if you like gambling, you have a gambling problem”. 

Damn- I guess I need to hold off playing blackjack with $20 on the cruise ships... because that’s a gamble I really enjoy. But apparently enjoying that gamble means I have a problem 🤣

Other than that, I agree with this. I too got sucked in. Lesson learned and I’m glad I listened to my instinct about not investing more than I already did. I’m mad at myself for not pulling out Friday when it bounced back for a bit. But I’m lucky I didn’t learn a more expensive lesson than I did! I hate that so many others learned a hard one 😞I too fell in to the hype to hold because we’re sticking it to the man. If I pulled out at the right time, I would be sitting much prettier and not feeling like a ‘diamond hands’ dumbass that listens to strangers. My 20k gain was good, but it does not feel good that it could have been 160k.Hold, hold, hold, buy and hold they cheered from the sidelines, having bought at 30...

219,GME SI DD - Short Interest Clarification,"I've been following the Short Squeeze Season since mid December and I'm interested in everything that has happened. I was trying to find up to date Short Interest values for all of the recent 'reddit/wsb/meme stocks', as CNBC and others like to call them.

I just wanted to share what I have found and I hope the information is valid. I'm not looking to persuade anyone any one way. I'm not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. Did I miss anything? I'm an ape. Moon. Rocket. Diamond Hands.

So I came across the FINRA 2021 Short Interest Reporting Dates, found here: [https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)

""FINRA requires firms to report short interest positions in all customer and proprietary accounts in all equity securities twice a month. All short interest positions must be reported by 6 p.m. Eastern Time on the second business day after the reporting settlement date designated by FINRA."" On January 27th, trading became restricted by a few brokers for GME and other stocks. On January 28th, RH restricted trades for the entire trading session, and many days after. However, on January 29th, firms had to report their short positions. This information will become public on Tuesday, Feb 9th. I'm not sure what time this will happen. Also, I'm not sure what the position will show from the January 29 reports. Were the positions recorded at different times from different firms? Were they recorded at closing hours? 6pm as well? Hard to tell.

Regardless, what I see as important here, is that at some point Tuesday Feb. 9th, we will have an updated Short Interest value. Until then, I wouldn't trust any sites values. i.e Finviz, which has shown the same 121% short float % for the past 2 weeks? Because I assume they too are awaiting the reports from FINRA. Does Bloomberg Terminal have access to this information somehow? After all, this data was reported on Feb. 2nd. So the information is out there somewhere.

I started a free-trial on: [https://www.ortex.com/](https://www.ortex.com/) and from a report on there, I found the short interest values that were reported on Dec. 31, 2020 and Jan. 15, 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/xz08amp573g61.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=38fd7c8c3fca875c14f7a2586b3462342feafd06

I have no idea what the short position will hold for Jan. 29th. I also have no idea how to interpret the Days to cover column. If anyone can provide anymore information I will update this post.

**tl/dr:** Short Interest Values should be updated on Tuesday, February 9th. Not sure what time. We'll know for sure if the squeeze is coming by then, if it hasn't happened before then.

Thanks to  [u/yimiemie](https://www.reddit.com/user/yimiemie/) for making me aware of this stock back at $6.67. It mooned, as he projected.

**What is Himax**

 “Himax Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: HIMX) is a fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display imaging processing technologies. Himax is a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs and timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and many other consumer electronics devices. Additionally, Himax designs and provides controllers for touch sensor displays, in-cell Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chip solutions, LED driver ICs, power management ICs, scaler products for monitors and projectors, tailor-made video processing IC solutions, silicon IPs and LCOS micro-displays for augmented reality (AR) devices and heads-up displays (HUD) for automotive. The Company also offers digital camera solutions, including CMOS image sensors and wafer level optics for AR devices, 3D sensing and machine vision, which are used in a wide variety of applications such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, TVs, PC cameras, automobiles, security, medical devices, home appliance and Internet of Things. Founded in 2001 and headquartered in Tainan, Taiwan, Himax currently employs around 2,000 people from three Taiwan-based offices in Tainan, Hsinchu and Taipei and country offices in China, Korea, Japan, Israel, and the US. Himax has 3,009 patents granted and 561 patents pending approval worldwide as of December 31st, 2020. Himax has retained its position as the leading display imaging processing semiconductor solution provider to consumer electronics brands worldwide.” 

**Q4 ER**

They smashed it. Oddly, the company released pre ER Q4 data and everyone just ignored the great news because of reasons. Then Q4 came and their guidance added fuel to the hot numbers. 

From the ER press release:

"" Q1 2021 Guidance: Revenue to increase by 5% to 10% sequentially, Gross Margin is expected to be 37% to 38%, IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be 30.0 cents to 34.0 cents, and Non-IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be 30.1 cents to 34.1 cents.""

They are telling you they'll moon. Telling you!

**Semiconductor constraints, right? AMD, right?**

Again, from the horse's mouth:

""Have **succeeded in securing more capacity for 2021** as compared to the level of Q4 2020 when Company reached the recent peak quarterly shipment. Expect the **total capacity available to Company to increase quarter by quarter in 2021 and will continue efforts in acquiring more capacity**. Also **secured a meaningful capacity increase is automobile where the global shortage for semiconductor supply is overwhelming**.""

So the company won't face the same constraints. Actually, they'll have more capacity.

**Who are their customers**

Samsung, LG, Lenovo, Huawei, Panasonic, Amazon, Sony, Mercedes, Jaguar, Asus, FOXCONN (come on), Google, and so many more.

**Catalysts**

Do you need more than their 2021 guidance? It's not secret the world is going EV. It's also no secret EV uses large displays instead of dinky nobs. Put 1 and 1 together.

**Value**

 HIMX trades at a big discount to its industry at 1.5X forward 12-month sales vs. 5.1X. (from Zack's). This was when the stock was $9.90. Going by their math, to get to the industry average, the stock should have a price point of $33.66.

Yeah, there's still room.

**Positions**

5,000 shares

100 03/19 $7 calls

HIMAX has given great guidance for 2021. Stock is undervalued already. This company will continue its rocket powered flight.

228,Can someone who was here before all the hype tell me why AMC got a lot of attention in tandem with GME?,"GME had a absolutely bonkers short interest, Ryan Cohen on the board, decent earnings, little to no debt, FTDs out the ass. it was the perfect set up for a short squeeze.

And you know what got a large percentage of the attention for seemingly no reason? No DD? No large discussions about it? AMC. 

If you’re wondering why I’m writing this post, why do I care? 

it’s because I’m genuinely confused as to why — when I told my friend to buy GME at 30 dollars and showed him hundreds of posts from here, I demonstrated that  the squeeze was inbound, I taught him all the concepts that went into the MOASS theory, the 🚀 🌝 mission was about to commence— he went ahead and waited until GME was at 150, bought a single share, and then bought 200 shares of AMC at its peak and is now holding the bag as he rightfully should. 

AMC had no fundamental reason for a squeeze, it has like a 50% SI as a percentage of float which is still high... but it wasn’t even close to a perfect set up that GME had. 


AMC was actually a dying company unlike (GME which is also dying) but it was like the difference between dying in a cardboard box and dying while cozy warm and strung out in a hospital bed surrounded by your family.

And lastly, AMC HAD NO DD.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leppzo/can_someone_who_was_here_before_all_the_hype_tell/,"Some hedge fund made it moon, then it caught the attention of the media. The poors who couldn't afford GME bought AMC. AMC was cheap and affordable and had potential to moon like GME. It's also a well known brand like GameStop and was a company everyone expected to go bankrupt. It has the same story as GME, sticking it to the hedge funds.Both are shorted. Both were on the brink of going under. 

Both have the potential of rebounding their companies substantially, if they are pragmatic. 

That’s it.AMC is in second place on the high SI lists. People think/though that it would become a trend for WSB to squeeze those stocks and wanted to get in ahead. Everyone had the same thought and so the money was spread across the list. Check highshortinterest.com for exampleI can tell you as a newb to the sub. I bought AMC because it was cheaper and tied closely in hype with GME. I definitely felt I had missed the boat with GME and lamented doing so. The sad thing is that BOTH stocks were on their way. Then they got the rug pulled out from underneath them when RH bailed and other brokers felt the need to “protect the investors from the volatile market”. I have no doubts had they not placed the trade restrictions AMC would have run up into the $30 range. Blatant market manipulation was happening. I watched pretty much all day last couple weeks as the big ups and downs happened. WSB went down for like 30 minutes and people ran for the hills. The stock plummeted. WSB came back up. Stock prices went up. The momentum was based solely on Reddit’s ability to communicate. WSB became compromised. They took away our voice. People lost interest. The media spun the narrative that this “wave was over”. Stocks went down.  I watched it all unfold almost every second. So many hands in the pot. If everyone would have sat back and let the market do its thing we would be way up by now. But the billionaires are in everyone’s back pocket. Honestly I’ve never felt so helpless. It feels like a carnival game and the rich are the disgusting mullet wearing carnies that rig it. If we could have just stayed together.I want to same data Citadel is getting at the same time they are getting it.Once GME squeezed every company with short interest got flooded and most of them popped. If you had a position before the rush you did pretty well. 

Unlike GME with catalysts to sustain the push, the other companies had no underlying reason to spike so it didn’t last long and led to way more losing positions.I believe I saw a couple AMC DD's back before GME blew up. A lot of them were about a comeback and how Disney (and others) would lose more by letting the movie theatre industry suffer.

But, yeah, not much other than that but somehow followed GME graph near perfectly.Never under estimate the power of memes.  They can literally move millions, if not billions, of capital around the market.  Its a whole new ballgame boys and girls.  🤯Because, fuck hedge funds.My best guess is that, like other companies that suffered from the pandemic AMC was generally thought to go under. But a few months ago they recieved funding and some people looked at the stock and thought there was potential the business could recover because a lot of other stocks in similar positions went up. 

Then the gme squeeze came and im sure some idiot's thought ""why get 10 Gme when I can get 100 AMC!"" Plus the flux of new people and hype of short squeeze echo chamber. 

That's my best explanation. Don't care about AMC, thought it could bounce a month ago or so but never would have longed it.",1612715372.0,106
229,$FB DD Valuation - Actual investing thread,"I'm going to aim for a quick write up so forgive my lack of fluidity. As always with investing, I invite counterpoints and criticisms/holes etc. of my pov.

Start with valuation - What should be the forward multiple for a stock like this. Practically every social media names trade at ~50+ forward multiple, each of course with diff verticals/growth rates/opportunities obv.

Mega cap names are trading at ~30 or so. Google is about there, msft and aapl are a tad higher and amzn trades in its own level largely due to bezos and what he's created etc.

The market trades at 22x.

Facebook trades at ~21x.

Of this forward multiple (its expected earnings), one can presume there isn't much contribution from whatsapp due to the egregiously low multiple of 21. (no one is expecting whatsapp to suddenly monetize to the extent it produces ~2,4,10 billion in revenue in the next ~handful of years.) Analyst expect 12.5~ eps in the next year, this gives the ~21x.

Lets break fb into parts - fb/insta/whatsapp (lets just assume oculus/vr doesn't surmount to anything).

whatsapp purchased for ~20b..insta 1. We know more about insta's contribution and with its greater growth and higher monetization (2/3rds of new add growth) we could probably assume it with at least a 30-40 multiple, what...200b market cap (snap is 100 and insta has 4x more users etc. I think 200 is conservative and fair, Id say more but w/e..200). Whatsapp has now over 2 bil users, likely ~2.5. This also would trade at 30-40x at what? 100 billion? Again, I'd say more, much more actually but let's just go with that right now.

This is important now -- fb is 750. They hold 70~ in net cash so the biz collectively is worth 680.

Insta is 200, whatsapp is 100...fb would be left with the remaining (BUT let's not forget there are efficiencies gained so let's say that in totality is worth 30 or w/e). We're left with FB, just facebook worth 350b. Now its a waste of time to discuss fb's reach and its continued growth etc etc because we should all know that already.

HERES THE BIG POINT - Assuming insta is worth 200, whatsapp 100, and as said above, their multiple is 30-40 (which I guarantee you would be the case considering every social media company and most tech names with growth similar to these --------- facebook would be left at a 350b valuation with a what...~10-15 forward multiple.

Now, who the fk would think a company the reach of facebook.com, the #4 downloaded app ahead of snap regularly, with growing users every year and stable users in n/a & eu ..with growing arpu YoY..should trade at 12 forward earnings.

Mark my words, fb will do what apple did, it will do what mu has recently done, it will be re-rated and the st will shortly forget the arguments of why fb traded at 20x while the market and all its peers are trading 50% higher. Break fb up (it wont happen), by all means..these stocks alone or together, are worth way more than 750.

Now as for apple and whatsapp very quickly and maybe I'll comment about it more in detal if people converse about it.

Apple - Unity just reported (with 50% ads, much less targeting ability than fb) apple should impact 6% or so of their revenue. Snap's guidance and commentary didn't seemed concerned. Facebook, as analysts and others have suggested, are likely going to lose 1-5% revenue. This equates just 3-4 months of pause in the stock, if not less, it's not this glorified terror that is going to ruin fb. It's nothing. no one will actually care after it passes lol.

2nd about whatsapp. whatsapp has like 60% or so of india's smartphone uses and in a few months, are going to announce their 'super app' integration with that big retailer I forgot the name, look it up if you care. They are trying to replicate wechat and become an app where people message each other, call each other, purchase food, purchase clothes, buy airplane tickets, show snap stories, etc. And they will also have facebooks data of those .5 bil users as well to help with suggestions/ads etc. TLDR - whatsapp is going to contribute 200-300 billion in market cap to fb in the next 3-4 years thru actual monetization.

The ONLY case you can make for fb trading this low is that you think it will be replaced 10-15 years from now or w/e..In which case, it shouldn't reflect this much in the stock as of right now. ONCE they show notably, real declines in users, stagnation in revenue, etc..we can panic and trade it closer to the market, but that is NOT the case right now. What will happen is - facebook will begin to trade closer to its peers and even more when they see continued growth in their top line - which will come from whatsapp's domination of india and maybe even brazil? Also, in 10-20 years, those weaker countries will start growing more in arpu, which would be HUGE for growing fb's top line. Something I've learned is - snap/tiktok, twitter, reddit, discord, netflix, youtube, insta, fb, can ALL live among each other. Each offers its own utility to each user. The harder would be for tiktok/snap to break into fb's territory rather than the other way around. Fb/insta 'profiles' will be here 20 years from now.

TLDR: I think fb is going to ~double in 3 years and triple in ~5. It should be at least 30% higher than its current price.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lepptd/fb_dd_valuation_actual_investing_thread/,"I think while you're probably right, Facebook is target #1 for regulations or other forms of government attention. I like the idea of buying, but I'd do it hedged against the chance that the company gets hit with some rule that hampers revenue. Think about it, out of all the big tech and social media companies, which do you think a politician would feel comfortable tampering with the most? The one that the public hates the most. Look at what happened to porn hub, when regulations hit they hit hard. It also looks like Biden is going to hire someone to lead all the anti trust lawsuits who LITERALLY worked at Google and Amazon. That really just leaves Facebook as the company to hate. I've got a pretty good feeling people are going to pin a lot of blame on Facebook as well for antivax, antimask, coronavirus denial, etc. I could see them making an example out of FB.


Buy FB shares but hedge, hold for ~2.5 years then reevaluate what's going to happen after this Biden term. Long term I'm bullish on FB, once Facebook the social media platform stops being the main business I'm going to invest heavily.I hope Facebook dies thoDude, I can't believe you left out Oculus LOL

Revenue in recent quarter was nearly 900 millions and growing fast man. [Source](https://vrscout.com/news/facebook-oculus-quest-2-successor-development/#:~:text=Facebook%20CFO%20Dave%20Wehner%20elaborated,2%20since%20its%20October%20launch.%E2%80%9D)

Eg. double in 3yrs, triple in 5.

Regarding your thesis: Have you considered that FBs growth is largely over? They can expand to new countries as the internet spreads, but those remaining places have less money to spend; ie. Lower revenue for ads. The other platforms have more room to grow and that's reflected in their valuations.

Additionally, FB is dead in the younger generations. Theyre hanging on by a thread with whatsapp and Insta, but idk anyone under the age of 30 who spends time regularly on FB. That divide is just going to grow as time goes on and minion-meme-posting boomers die off.

I dont feel strongly about any of this, just my two centsPositions or banFb is a no go for me bro. For what their share value is to how they treat the products (us) fuck zuckercuck. I'd rather put my money in clov.Sir, this is a casino.

231,"FUBO massive growth prospects, the importance of addressable market size (TAM) and revenue per customer (CLV)","FUBO TV is a sports focused “cable on the internet” streaming service, replacing your cable package (avg. $100+ per month) for $65 per month. In January they acquired Vigtory, a sports betting startup, and will integrate it into their streaming platform this year. Entering 2021 FUBO has \~500,000 subscribers, with 80% year over year growth, and a market value of \~$5 billion.

These numbers mean two things: First, **FUBO has a proven product** with traction and growth. Second, it has **just started to penetrate a massive market**. While there are many excellent companies in the streaming and sports betting space, most are already past this growth phase. ROKU has a market cap of $55 billion. DKNG has a market cap of $25 billion. PENN has a market cap of $20 billion. This is why all the analysts are excited about FUBO. **It is much easier for FUBO to go from $5 billion to $50 billion over the next few years, than a competitor to go from $25-$50 billion to $500 billion which is Facebook/Tesla level.**

There are still 80 million Americans who have yet to cut the cord, who can probably save money today by switching to FUBO. There are 30 million Americans who have cut the cord, and can add live sports with FUBO while the bars are closed. All of them can spend a lot more money on FUBO once betting is up, since the Supreme Court struck down the federal sports betting law in 2018 in Murphy vs. NCAA.

Combining a $100 billion a year streaming/cable market, with a $20 billion a year and growing sports betting market, means enormous growth prospects for little FUBO at $400 million a year revenue and 80% year over year growth.

At $50 a share, FUBO’s valuation is about $10,000 per subscriber. This is about 10x the Netflix valuation of $1000 per subscriber. This might seem high, but it is in fact a fair valuation for several reasons. First, it is a $65 per month product. Second, it has increased its advertising revenue 153% last year to a small but significant $7.5 million. Third, sports betting could make a large percent of FUBO subscribers 100x more valuable than the typical streaming customer. Fourth, Netflix has 200 million subscribers vs FUBO’s 500 thousand, meaning more value can be imputed to growth. Most importantly, all these reasons are still applicable even if FUBO grows another 50-100% for the next few years. FUBO’s customer lifetime value (CLV) is probably already above the norm, and can moon with more advertising and gambling. That is why many are confident that FUBO can be the next ROKU, and reach $200/share or more in the next few years.

In fact, **at $50 per share FUBO’s price/sales is \~45, compared with 56 for DKNG and 35 for ROKU, despite having better growth prospects.** This means FUBO can probably sustain a higher price today, even before news over the next year validates the growth thesis. And there might be short squeeze! (See other DD for that).

Right, wrong, or indifferent, IMO it’s the best way to look at this right now. Pay attention and use critical thinking skills. Don’t believe what random strangers tell you on the internet, don’t buy into hype or memes, and make money decisions with your head, not your heart. You will make mistakes, learn, and decide if you want to grow your knowledge and skills in this area or do something else. Day trading is like gambling and it isn’t for everyone and that’s what you need to know most. 

It isn’t over until you give up. People that can’t stomach it have some decisions to make, but they ours to make. Don’t let someone else herd mentality you into something. Don’t go to a single source or person for your information, looking for the most upvoted or awarded post to guide you. That’s exactly the type of shit that makes you part of the herd. You want to be part of the pack if you chase money and I think that’s the lesson some of us learned here.Closing the door was the dip before blast offIf we just keep buying we already established we can force the price to 500 so idk why anyone jumped ship

242,"Evidence points to GME Shorts not having covered but pretending they did (via the use of options to illegally ""cover"" with synthetic long shares) to break the squeeze","Long post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing. *(This is a re-post and an updated version of a GME DD that reached the front page of WSB and many requested it to be pinned. I am re-posting for visibility and because I believe the message should be shared, particularly at this junction in time. If you've seen this post before, I would appreciate an upvote for visibility)*

TLDR: **Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, specifically an illegal method/loophole to ""cover"" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options**. Full details below.

There’s an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

The first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

The second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can [read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

***“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****”**

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry’s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located. To summarize, it is the act of prolonging an illegal short position with the use of synthetic shares generated through a loophole that is the issue at hand.

If this is true, and as explained there are signs that indicate it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes ""its only a loss when you sell."" The version for shorts would be ""its only a loss if you close out your short positions.""

Another factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that present the argument that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)

In addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. Why? Something to think about.

I would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March ([screenshot from a WSB post](https://preview.redd.it/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)). In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.

In considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case? Two thoughts come to mind.

**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/)

**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at** [**https://www.sec.gov/tcr**](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

Sidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the ""new"" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.

If you think about GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purpose of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.

There's an adage oft repeated on WSB that retail investors can stay ""retarded"" longer than funds can stay solvent. The ""paper hand"" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)

At least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:

* **""Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.""** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.
* **""If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.""** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks ([read this for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares', which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts, can be used to ladder attack the stock price](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/), which also supports the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play) and other potential methods.
* **""If his forces are united, separate them""** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving ""weak-hands"" to sell-off this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some ""paper hands"", who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the silver fake news/manipulation and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.

I will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further. If you agree with the ideas explored in this post, feel free to share with whomever you'd like, and thank you for your part in raising awareness.

He’s just calling it out straight: synthetic longs ARE counterfeit shares when used to get around short sale reporting.This is a fantastic post covering the various inconsistencies noted over the past two weeks. 

I am specifically intrigued with S3 Partners changing methodology over last weekend and how the media did not pick this up. Instead, the only piece that was picked up was short interest had fallen to ~55% from over 100%, when that is false. Per the new methodology, short interest could have never gone over 100%, but the media failed to mention that. 

It is all just very odd. I am usually not one to be a conspiracy theorist, but the silver squeeze BS, bots all over this Reddit, S3 data, low volume, and then this past Friday’s spike up - something is fishy and I’m here to watch it.I just can't wait to squeeze the HF ballsacks once again 💎🙏Nice post op. Keep up the due diligence so we dont have to double down. DD.What is not discussed enough is what strike of options we think they used, which is where I think there is 4 broad scenarios. 

They sell Out of The Money calls, eg strike $800(OTM):
This would have very low delta, hence the hedge funds would need to sell like 5 times their short to get enough length. And if the squeeze ever got to $800 then they would be 5 times more squeezed past that point.

They sell In The Money calls, eg strike $4(ITM):
This would have effectively 100% delta letting them hedge fully quickly, but in reality wouldn’t change any dynamics, the call would almost entirely act as an already exercised short, making them short again unless price actually falls below $4.

They sell At the Money calls, strike = that days price(ATM):
This would have about just over 50% delta so they would need to sell double their position to fully hedge. And if they did this man did they win so far. BUT they would have then doubled down on their position, the next time a squeeze happens it would happen twice as hard.

They bought Puts at any strike:
This would have the same effect with MM hedging and Hedge Funds rebuying the length. But without too much detail, this would mean the Hedge Funds are paying More premium, increasing their daily costs and meaning the squeeze or fall better happen soon.

TLDR: If I understand correctly, Options to reduce SI is a way to hide but actually would make a future squeeze more prominent.Hold 🚀🌕What the fuck is the point in the SEC?",1612712449.0,22321

249,UFO 🛸 🛸 🛸 arriving to the ARKX party early.,"UFO is an etf that provides diversification in the companies interested in exploring space. 

[First things first, here are UFOs holdings.](https://procureetfs.com/etfs/ufo.html#holdings)
Looks pretty damn good huh? The popular Virgin Galactic (spce) comes in currently as its 2nd highest holding @ 6.84%

Cathie from ARK investments is [planning her own space exploration etf.](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/01/13/cathie-woods-ark-invest-plans-space-exploration-etf-arkx.html) Cathie has grown an enormous cult following and you can bet there will be plenty of interest. Currently UFO is the only space exploration etf in the market, and has only been around a year. Options just became available last week due to the rising volume. 

Since the announcement we’ve seen spce make a huge run. Spce was an obvious choice but there are many other companies set to be bought up. Cathie like to have ~50 companies in her etfs. Speculation which companies she decides to add can be tough, so this is why I’m playing UFO. There’s likely to be several gems that can easily 2x or 3x in the coming months if not more. Once we have more details and announcements on ARKX, hype will go way up from where it is now. 

Here’s a few other reasons why UFO is both a value and momentum play:

Satellite, tourism, and telecom are now economically viable thanks to the decreasing launch costs achieved by spaceX. 

Location based ride sharing king and food delivery are rapidly growing because of the power of satellite-enabled navigation. 

The formation of the U.S. Space Force.

The option volume is currently low therefore UFO has wide bid ask spreads but I expect this to change in the upcoming months.

253,Best way to transfer out of RH,"FYI: My transfer to Fidelity took 2 days, yours may vary. I opened my account last Saturday around 6 AM, initiated the transfer and was given a deadline of 2/8. Well it was fully transferred by 2/3 at 5 AM. 

Steps:

1. Buy 1 cheap stock

2. Transfer everything else but the cheap one from step 1. (This is in case they transfer it wrong ...like mentioned [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld0j3e/done_fck_rh/gm48ekb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)) If that happens, your account will still remain active because of this cheap stock. 

3. Always keep that cheap stock until you decide when you want to deactivate.

4. You can keep that account open for ease of tax documents in 2021, then deactivate. 

Or


Remove that last share and deactivate your account after RH IPOs.

They will want to show growth (as a public company you have to disclose numbers), hard to show growth when customers are leaving.


 Couple important things:

Check your statements in RH. More than likely you will see that any position you have created is listed under Margin. Call up the other broker, inform them of the situation, make sure it is all under cash account. Do not have margin on in new account and be 100% positive that your shares will not be loaned out. 

Other brokers will take time to approve you for options trading...surprise surprise, real brokers doing real things. 

Each transfer from RH will cost $75...while you are on the phone with the new broker, ask them and they may cover the fee...after all, they are gaining a customer so $75 isn’t going to hurt them.

##Make sure live quotes are enabled.
(they are not by default.)

Both Fidelity and TDA can enable live quotes from the app or on the website.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leodor/best_way_to_transfer_out_of_rh/,"I'm in the process now.

257,AMD DD: A Former Meme Ready To Reignite The Rocket Fuel🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,"
A DD I found previously on WSB from u/drrona but aligns with my TA findings as well. Thought I’d share here as I believe it shows a great buying opportunity for AMD especially in the next coming weeks.

# Fundamentals:

Their latest ER:

**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**

**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**

Server revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible.

Massive increase in guidance. They’re **expecting 37% growth** this year.

So why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let’s be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.

Obviously, we’d prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you’re gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, “hey we have too many orders and we can’t keep up sorry, we’ll get it to you ASAP”

Imagine thinking this company isn’t going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.

Our queen, Lisa Su, said “there will be added capacity” in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they’ll be good to go. I wouldn’t worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.

**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**

Intel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!

**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.

**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.

# Technicals:

For those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.

We really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we’re basically there right now.

In addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**

For more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.

IBMs servers (power 9 etc, as400 system i) are what financial services companies, banks, etc run their core databases on (the thing that holds your account information) these run a db2 database and are incredibly secure and old and reliable.

IBM charge 100k’s for one of those

AMD CANNOT and will not ever compete with that, no company is going to shift their system onto amd ever.
Even from a fundamental standpoint 

This js because what ibm provides amd cannot, FUNDAMENTALLY 

Even cloud hosting (aws and azure) DOES NOT have iseries, power systems, system i or as400.

They wont ever compete with intel in the server market as cross platform virtualisation does not mix.
Why would an IT manager move onto amd when 
You cannot load balance an esxi intel server with an amd one

It’s actually funny how you think amd is competing with IBM

260,$SLV is Currently Undervalued Whether There is a Squeeze or Not (Physical market price discrepancies)," 

Last week there were a lot of people hating on the posts about silver going up. These people instead pumped stocks like $GME and $AMC (which went down 75%). There are real reasons why silver is going to go up.

First of all, physical silver is becoming more and more difficult to get by the day. Currently an ounce of physical silver will cost you anywhere from $34 - $40. This is $7 - $13 over paper silver prices. It makes you wonder why physical is going up so much when the paper market is still staying flat/going down.

There is manipulation in the silver market by big banks such as JPM and Goldman Sachs. COMEX can just create paper silver contracts out of thin air, which keeps the silver prices down. The COMEX cannot possibly fill all of the open interest on the silver futures contracts. That's why when silver started to go up last week, they raised the margin requirements on the contracts by 18%, forcing larger players to sell when they received margin calls.

With all the money printing going on, and rates being held near zero, its hard to believe that the price of silver is fairly valued. I believe that all this money will eventually find its way into silver, just like it found its way into the stock market.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lengv9/slv_is_currently_undervalued_whether_there_is_a/,"I hold PSLV, a few juniors, some physical, AG calls, CDE calls and AGQ callsNot sure why all the hate on Silver. It’s not a conspiracy theory, the price of silver is being forced artificially low. We just want the free market price discovery. 

Even if it just comes down to economics 101, supply and demand. In 5 weeks 200 million physical ounces has been purchased (actual physical or in funds PSLV, SLV, etc). That’s a year supply in 5 weeks, the price will rise as supply is limited.If you factor in that there is very little chance SLV actually holds physical metal, then no it is definitely not overvalued.

The custodian of SLV is JP Morgan.  Same bank that downgraded silver at 5 AM Tuesday morning while simultaneously dumping 1.5 billion ounces of paper silver on the market causing all of Monday’s gains to evaporate.  Same bank that was labeled a “Criminal Enterprise” by the DOJ for manipulating the precious metals market.There are $4,800+ dollars per ounce of silver.

There was $2.66 dollars per ounce in 1913.

There are 185 to 1 paper ounces for every ounce of silver atm.

(for context GME had roughly 2.5 shares outstanding for every share and looked what happened to GME!)

Any precious metal index fund will go up by like 40% by the end of the year. I don't see why you'd have to buy $SLV specifically.What positions do you currently have?

CLF/X PT @ 30 after Biden’s Breakfast Burito plan is formally announced in the next 30 days.All this talk about physical vs paper silver gives me such deja vu about all the fierce physical vs paper gold debates after the 2008 crash. Gold did go up but it wasn't because there was a squeeze due to the physical vs paper mismatch. 

What baffles me is why silver has diverted so much from gold price movements even though both used to move in tandem. Is that purely due to JPM shorting it? That mean reversion would be interesting to play but I don't know if short term calls are the answer. Maybe silver leaps to play 3 things:

1. physical-paper mismatch
2. Gold-silver pricing mean reversion
3. More industrial uses of silver as economy opens upPosition or ban",1612708151.0,0

262,Advice for transferring from RH -> Fidelity,"So it seems like a lot of people are having issues with transferring away from Robinhood, I was able to successfully get all my assets away with relatively little difficulty, so I'll share my process in hopes of helping others transfer with relative ease.

# Things to expect:

1. **YOUR ROBINHOOD ACCOUNT WILL BE DEACTIVATED DURING THE TRANSFER. NO BUYING, SELLING, OR WITHDRAWING MONEY. YOU WILL STILL SEE YOUR ASSETS IN RH UNTIL THE TRANSFER COMPLETES.**
2. ASSETS TRANSFERRED FROM ROBINHOOD SHOW UP AS MARGIN ASSETS. Once your assets finish transferring from RH, **call up Fidelity and ask them to convert the margin assets to cash assets.** Why does this happen? Robinhood makes every account a ""limited margin"" account by default since ""Instant deposits"" count as margin, because you are technically loaning RH's money to buy shares while your bank deposit clears. It doesn't matter if the cash is settled or not, it's the account type. RH wants to be able to use the shares you buy as collateral if a deposit doesn't go through.
3. NOT ALL ASSETS WILL TRANSFER AT THE SAME TIME, YOUR TRANSFER MAY SEEM COMPLETE BUT IF EVERYTHING IS NOT THERE IT IS NOT FINISHED. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST $75 IN YOUR FIDELITY ACCOUNT BEFORE THE TRANSFER COMPLETES. I got a little annoyed on this, Robinhood debits the brokerage account you transfer to for the $75 transfer fee, not debiting it from any settled cash you have with Robinhood first. This resulted in my Fidelity account getting charged the $75 transfer fee (and me getting margin called technically), and the \~$200 of settled cash with RH was stuck for a couple of days before finally getting transferred over. My transfer showed as complete on 2/3 (with assets and $75 fee) but the settled cash didn't transfer until 2/5.

# How to make it easier/less of a headache:

1. Make sure every transaction has settled/will settle before your ACATS request is acknowledged by RH. In personal experience, they acknowledge it within 2 business days, but assume it will happen immediately to be safe.
2. Sell any fractional shares. These don't get transferred and will be sold off anyways as part of the transfer. Idk if c\*\*\*\*\* gets sold or held since they are a different account technically, but regardless I'd not use RH for c\*\*\*\*\* anymore. (Can't fuckin say the word cuz automod)
3. Make sure NO MARGIN BALANCE (Instant Deposits or RH Gold) is being used. If they are, that will likely complicate things. This ties into #1 of making sure assets have settled, this includes deposits. If you are using any of your Instant deposit balance wait for the cash to settle first, otherwise you might get hit with some ridiculous margin debit when assets transfer. If you have a position that is using margin, probably best to talk to Fidelity before transferring to make sure you know what else is needed.

# Finally: DON'T ""TRANSFER"" BY SELLING ALL ASSETS ON RH AND BUYING BACK ON FIDELITY. YOU WILL PAY TAXES FOR THIS.

Good luck and FUCK ROBINHOOD.

EDIT:  /u/racerxff [also found out that RH DOES NOT transfer cost basis info for assets, so make sure you note it down yourself for entry later](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/len1ge/advice_for_transferring_from_rh_fidelity/gmh5sf7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/len1ge/advice_for_transferring_from_rh_fidelity/,"Would be really curious on the number of RH accounts that transferred. Anywhere they publish that info or no because they are a private company still?been on fidelity for years.  You'll be happy on there.  Also, the switch from options level 1,2,3 or 4  is very easyI just got done chatting with Fidelity Rep,  ""when robin hood sends us an account, they always code it as a margin account even if the client was all cash. So were transferred margin credits of securities, all we did is cancel it out for you more or less. so now the stocks such as GME and AMC are all in cash ready to rock and roll. ""

Also, a little bonus "" we are re doing our app this year beginning of Q2 to help make it easier to use "" - I hope fidelity pulls this off and makes the UI as easy to use as RHYou only pay taxes if youre in the green.Make sure all your shares are settled to cash and not margin and that your invested money is not instant buying power (margin) or you'll be be dealing with the fuckery that is RH.Sir, this is the unemployment line.

263,Bumble (BMBL) shares to go live 11th Feb - could be worth a punt,"Hey all,

I'm thinking of punting on Bumble (which will trade with the ticker BMBL) when the shares go live on 11th Feb. I'm writing this DD live as I'm fact finding, but here's my take on it.

**Personal experience:**

I've never needed to use a dating app personally, but I have numerous friends who absolutely live by Bumble and I've seen that it works long term (plenty of fun dates, followed by matching up and eventually marriage). My female friends who have used it love the fact that it is woman led and initiated, meaning they don't get inundated with belligerent sex pests like on other platforms, and the guys I know who use it like it because it means that there is less pressure to ooze sex appeal (that they arguably don't have) and be more honest in their profiles. It seems like a far cry from the clear market contender Tinder. As a product, if I were ever in the ""available"" in *that* market again, I'd probably consider using Bumble myself.

**Previous valuations:**

* Between 2016-2018 they were approached with multiple offerings of $500M - $1B \[1\]. Their revenue in this period ranged from $10m in 2016 to $190m. This means they were effectively trading at premium multipliers of between 50 (early on) and 5 (in 2018).
* In 2019 they were bought by Blackstone by $3B \[1\]. Their earnings for this year were $240m, meaning they effectively traded at a revenue premium multiplier of 12.
* We don't have 2020 numbers, but in 2018 there were 35 million users and this year there are 100 million users. I would imagine that their earnings have taken a hit this year with COVID (i.e. lockdowns preventing hookups) but this just means it might be a great opportunity to buy in now.

**Some other considerations:**

* It has been reported that dating app usage actually went up during lockdowns \[2\] which does seem to defy logic. So potentially this might mean a nice surprise at the first public earnings announcement.
* 5 million use it in the US \[3\] - which is some way behind Tinder despite having a very similar market offering. This means that there is growth potential in the user base in the US, and presumably elsewhere in the world too.
* As a long term hold, this has potential: most of the users of the app are aged less than 35 and this is a replenishing stock of potential customers from below.

It looks like trading will start at around $30 a share and a market capitalisation of between $6-8B. To put this in perspective, Match (who own Tinder) are currently valued at $41B - and they made $2.4B in revenue in 2020. This means Match current trades on a revenue multiplier of 17.

Assuming that Bumble can scale 2018 earnings with users, 2020 might see revenues of around $600M. If this is the case and they can attract a similar multiplier, this puts the potential market capitalisation at something like $10.2B. This means that the price could, in relatively short term after first reported earning period, increase to between $38-50. Of course beyond this there is still plenty of scope for increasing the size of their user base, and with it additional revenue in the future.

None of this is advice, and because this hasn't been previously listed it isn't so clear to see the long term valuation of the company and could easily be wrong and it tanks immediately. But I will be buying when the bell goes on the 11th because I think it is worth a punt.

- Monday, January 25, 2021, $GME stock reached a high price of $159 per share before dropping to $76. Even though the CNBC people were calling this “A Side Show,” they spent most of the day talking about it.

-Tuesday, January 26th, 2021, $GME closes at $147 per share. WSB goes Viral on news that Melvin Capital needed a 2.5 Billion dollar bail out. [WSB clocks 15 million unique searches that day alone.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pnax/wsb_traffic_growth_what_going_viral_looks_like/)

-Wednesday, January 27th, 2021, WSB was national and international front-page news. $GME hits $350 per share. [Here’s the Today Show segment about us, showing front page headlines, and Stephanie Rule showing us some love… despite being worried for ‘new investors’ (but we’ll definitely take the love part)](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/gamestop-reddit-explainer-what-s-happening-stock-market-n1255922)

#January 27th, 2021:
#How the Reddit / $SLV Rumor began
##(I’m just assuming WSB was getting 25 million hits by this day)\

1. On Thursday, January 27, 2021, u/jjalaj30 (who is not a bot) posted:
[“THE BIGGEST SHORT SQUEEZE IN THE WORLD SLV SILVER $25-$1000”](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/gl1u57n/?context=3)  Good for Him being passionate about his investments, BTW! This post must have been seen by millions because, I’m just assuming, WSB was getting 25 million hits by this day given the virality of the previous days.

Sales of Silver ETFs and Spot began to rise 

$GME reaches $480 (OP buys 1.45 shares of $GME at $360 because Why Not. Also bought $BBBY at $36… and holding).  Robinhood shuts down trading, $GME price starts immediately crashing 

2.On Thursday afternoon, at 12:03pm (I’m assuming eastern time?) the First article about Reddit causing the price Silver to go up is written by Reuters.  [“Reddit raiders swarm silver stocks as GameStop, BlackBerry retreat”](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN29X2DT) and quotes directly from u/jjalaj30’s post

3. On Thursday afternoon, 2:45pm, metal industry websites and investor blogs begin running blog articles stating ”Reddit Day Traders” are fueling this random rise in Silver sales:
-[Bullion Vault](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/silver-prices-012820212) 
-[Street](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/silver-prices-surge-as-reddits-retail-army-refocuses-wrath-against-precious-metal-short-sellers-202101281501)

4. The first article claiming WSB was leaving $GME and heading to silver came from the Wall Street Journal at 4:38pm: [Silver Surges as Game Stop Traders Move Into Other Assets.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/silver-surges-as-gamestop-day-traders-move-into-other-assets-11611848703?mod=searchresults_pos8&amp;page=1) 


5. Blogger/reporter Anna Golubova posted an article at 11:48pm on Kitco about an Army of Day Traders piling into silver? She explains that analysts think the price of silver will reach $40 and [shares a screenshot of the above post by u/jjalaj30.](https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-01-28/Army-of-day-traders-piling-into-silver-As-prices-rally-analysts-point-to-40-and-higher.html)


6. However, The London based Investors Chronicles gave a good analysis of why Silver (and Gold) were higher. [They say its because the US dollar slid.](https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/news/2021/01/29/robinhood-anger-silver-linings/)


##Friday, January 29, 2021

7.Friday, 2am, Bloomberg runs a story: [Reddit Investors piling into silver raise prices a Second Day.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/silver-market-jitters-are-on-display-after-reddit-frenzy)

8.Friday Morning, Kitco News does a long segement discussing the Wednesday Reddit post about shorting Silver: https://www.kitco.com/news/video/show/Market-Analysis/3191/2021-01-29/Retail-investors-want-to-short-squeeze-silver-to-$1k-is-this-possible#_48_INSTANCE_puYLh9Vd66QY_=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kitco.com%2Fnews%2Fvideo%2Flatest%3Fshow%3DMarket-Analysis


9. But a metal indusrty blog Mining [dot] Com does an entry on Friday morning cslling this a ***“Frenzy.”***: [Silver Prices rally for second day on Reddit Frenzy](https://www.mining.com/silver-prices-higher-on-reddit-frenzy/)\

Weekend sales of physical Silver soar. From Friday to Monday the price of Silver goes from $25.50 to $28.50. That’s a huge jump in the silver market. Somehow, the only explanation for this has to be Reddit, right.\

10. Sunday, January 31, 2021. Bllomberg TV does a story: [Reddit-Inspired Army takes aim at silver.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-02-01/reddit-inspired-army-takes-aim-at-silver-video)


##By Monday, Feburary 1, 2021. All the news outlets are running with a story that Reddit is causing the silver price to spike.

The Wall Street Journal runs story: [Reddit’s Silver Rush Is Another Symptom of Market Madness]( https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddits-silver-rush-is-another-symptom-of-market-madness-11612183688?mod=searchresults_pos6&amp;page=1)

If you go to Google News and type in “Reddit Silver” for that date of Feburary 1st, 2021, you’ll get 13 pages of results. This is my favorite one:

Monday, Feburary1, 2021, at 11:53am, Yahoo Finance publishes a story based on a person’s tweet (I’m not kidding, its based on a Tweet): [Is Silver the New Game Stop? Thanks to Reddit, Precious Metals hits 11 year high.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silver-gamestop-thanks-reddit-precious-163259125.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZDsEHA-5OI2NT7xu3gDSn-lm5-Z3hF-SmzHD37Ltfe7CsXTW2GlA34k2slxHlCvDD0sz94ubt2biqmTiijfuYhyEnN_GiRvx7SsCjgw0WMVtUaqP8xPAHS2f0-AfSx5O9Dx5rG13NR6nZCpwMx6X9vRl97RIalfeddG-tctorR)

##On Tuesday, 3/2/2021, The price of silver ‘corrects.’ Stocks WSB are HOLDING THE LINE on ($GME, $AMC, $BB,) start losing some market value too. So naturally all the new outlets lump Sliver, $GME, $AMC, $BB as one WSB total corridnated Short-Squeeze attack that failed because all these Redditors were stupid. 

Tuesday, Forbes: [Reddit Group Fails in Effort to Squeeze Silver Market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2021/02/02/reddit-group-fails-in-effort-to-squeeze-the-silver-market/?sh=2e2dde403bcb)


Ben Martin of the Sunday Times wrote on Tuesday: [The spot silver price slid by 8 per cent from Monday’s eight-year high as a rush into the metal by amateur traders co-ordinating on the Reddit social media website faltered](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/reddit-army-falters-as-silver-rally-loses-steam-cs5gfpjh7)\



##So, Yes, a Redditor did post on WSB about silver. Reuters ran a story about the post, then Metal Industry people wrote articles about the post after Reuters, then The Wall Street Journal said WSB moving away from $GME and into silver, then lazy journalism took over where other reporters just start copying other reporters’ articles [ - Here is a Good Read on that - ](https://observer.com/2015/04/journalisms-sourcing-problem/), and then when silver corrected on the same day $GME and $AMC took a hit, all the media blamed us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lemo97/how_reports_in_the_media_claiming_that_reddit/,"So one guy with no account history posts silver.  Everyone else says gtfo with that shit.  Media says SEE THEY POSTED ABOUT IT!!  Clowns trying their best to take over the circus.So it's the same model of media usage by politicians being used by wallstreeters that fund politician campaigns? WeirdConsidering you can pay Reuters to publish an article, this doesn't seam far fetched.It's funny that on one hand they say we haven't the power to squeeze GME while in the other hand they are shilling that we were moving the whole silver market, what a joke! Stupid really as once the boomers are fading away who do they expect to watch CNBC and the like, well not us thats for sure, one day they will slip into obscurity like good old blockbuster and that makes me warm inside :)This is how they work anyway when they short stocks.

They don‘t just load up on short options, they also actively badmouth the company and otherwise do whatever they can to ruin their reputation to bring the share price down.

This is happening every day.

The reddit community already saved AMC from bankruptcy and everyone that buys and holds is giving GME 2.0 a great start.

Call their bluff, bring attention to how shady HF work.

I came for the money and stayed for the cause.

Here is a report from Rick Smith how his company was targeted and nearly ruined by shortsellers.

[https://link.medium.com/vge5JnSCGdb](https://link.medium.com/vge5JnSCGdb)[https://link.medium.com/vge5JnSCGdb](https://link.medium.com/vge5JnSCGdb)u/jjalaj30 “who is not a bot”. Yeah, right.I think CBC (Canadian government-owned news company) is the only significant news outlet that reported this right:

[Silver price surges amid investor frenzy — but Reddit users say it isn't them](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/silver-stocks-surge-1.5895790)I like how that guy’s entire post history was basically that silver post and a couple random comments from months agoJust super lazy reporting from reporters who don’t understand Reddit, all that bullshit inspired me to write this post: [Why is the media still reporting on Reddit Investors and not hedge fund manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbaibb/why_is_the_media_still_reporting_on_reddit/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Edit: this was a few hours before the coup here and posting this here got me muted / banned for 24 hrs so had to post it in r/stocks which is also interesting.Reddit is obliviously a hive mind where we never disagree and all March in unison, just read it",1612705370.0,2114
268,Became debt free in one week- too life changing to not paper hand 🚀🚀🚀🚀,,https://i.redd.it/ygr4v4iy52g61.jpg,"It's not paper handed if you sell on a significant profit. It's paper handed when you panick sell on a loss.A paper handed retard without debt is all I’ve ever wanted to be.As stubborn as I am with holding, people selling to pay off debts or change their life is always really satisfying to see. Well done 🙌Beautiful. I sold my 48c 2/5 on 1/27 for 30k and my 125c 1/29 on 1/29 for 22.3k. I'm now free from credit card debt for the first time in many years. About to move out of this ghetto and into an area without bars on the windows and such. 


The loss porn is fun but knowing that some people made (imo) life changing money is fucking awesome. I did exercise my 120c on 1/29 so I'm still holding 100 shares *just in case*.Good job, I understand. Hope you continue to do wellNothing wrong with exiting while you’re ahead.Hope you saved like 1/3 of your earnings for taxes.I was up enough to pay off all my debts, pay off my car, put a big down payment on a home, and I was retarded and held and ended up losing money in the end

I'm a fucking retardLol so it was retail quietly selling to other retails while screaming “hold the line.” Hedge Funds didn’t fuck you bag holders, your own retail brother/sisters did.Leave some for the tax man",1612704839.0,2853
269,Will GME actually go up?,"I have seen a lot of data here, i don't fully understand. I see a lot of memes and a few conspiracies that may be true may not. I would like to just believe it will actually go up again but i'm sceptic. My feeling is that this are just a lot of people that don't want the hype to end and a ton of confirmation bias. Ofcourse, i can be completely wrong. The data seems convincing, i guess but i don't actually know enough to evaluate that shit, so you could probably convince me of anything using the same data.

So, to the people that aren't too emotional invested in this, not giving a fuck about hedgefounds, diamond hands etc:

Do you think GME will go up again? If so, do you actually think it's going to the moon or does it just go up to like 200 again?

Edit: I think there was a misunderstanding. Don't worry, i didn't buy anything. Just wanted to understand the whole thing better and maybe decide to buy a bit afterwards. I asked because the frontpage suggests that everything will go way up again, which i didn't really believed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lemgux/will_gme_actually_go_up/,"All we need is someone to streak across the field at the super bowl with GME painted on their bodyNo one knows. Take either side with a grain of salt and a huge dose of skepticism. Ultimately, this is a casino. Do not seek financial advice. Only put in what you're willing to lose.Stocks go up. Sometimes down. Sometimes, if you are oil, it can go negative.Nobody knows. Everyone slated deepfuckingvalue for his buys on GME almost 2 years ago, who’s fucking laughing nowFor now I'm holding, none of that HOLD THE LINE bullshit though. Last week let me average down to $127. If it starts trending down then I buy more and write calls until I get my money back. If it starts trending up, I'll just hold it until I'm not down any money or down less than 10%. At that point with either situation, I can decide whether or not I still want to be in GME. Fuck everyone who's getting emotional on both sides, no one cares how people feel.Has anyone bought a superbowl ad for wsb and gme/amc yet?When looking for “data,” you have to ask yourself, “Am I looking for the truth or am I just trying to find something to make me feel better about the retarded decision I’ve made.”If I lose money on this I blame no one but my self. What if I sell and this does go up who do I blame then. The bottom line is that it’s my choice.                                    And people who act like Reddit posters were responsible for GME AMC NOK BB stocks to drop and not Citadel should not be trusted. We really got screwed by Wall Street in broad daylight and not everyone’s ok with it.This question has three answers and all are equally valid.  

The first answer is ""Nothing in the market is certain, we are all gambling our life savings on Monopoly money, and play at your own risk.""

The second answer is that there is no usable information with which to gauge whether or not a third peak of the squeeze is coming. It is my opinion that it is likely that no matter how many people continue to hold, the Robinhood fiasco combined with others who did the same likely robbed the train of momentum and without miraculous circumstances, it is unlikely that there will be again. It's possible, but due to the masturbatory quality of 99% of the data on both sides of the subject, planning on this now would be something you'd absolutely only want to do with money you can afford to lose. 

The third answer is also a ""maybe"". But more likely. Due to recent announcements regarding the staff change after Cohen was made CEO, it is unlikely GameStop maintains their current trajectory of poor ecom presence, poor customer service, gradually declining relevance and stock prices. It is absolutely still a gamble, but I'm of the opinion that three to four years from now we could see around $300-400 again, making this the baby version of the Tesla jump.Only way it will go up at this point is a catalyst from gamestop themselves saying they will recall shares or buy the remaining shares",1612704624.0,119

I left the DD, my eviction notice and a rocket at the bottom.  🚀

Dear mister “ I’m too good for calls or buy GME shares”, this will be the  last bullcase I ever send your ass, it’s been six days and still no  tweet, I don’t deserve it?

I know you got the last charts, the media published them perfect.

So this is my DD I'm sending you I hope you hear it I'm in a Tesla right now, dare me to drive?

You  know that song by Darude? Forgot it's name.

About that guy who could a  saved that other guy from drowning, but didn't, then Phil saw it all,  then at a a show he found him?

That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning in debt

Now it's too late, I'm down a thousand dollars now, I'm drowsy

And all I wanted was a lousy investment or a call

I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall

I love you Elon, we could have been on Mars together, think about it, you ruined it now.

I hope you get shorted and you dream about it, and when you dream I hope you get shorted more and you scream about it.

I hope the hedgefunds eats at you and you can’t breath without GME

""BUY SILVER, BUY SILVER""

SHUT UP CNBC I'm trying to Talk

Hey Elon that's the hedge fund managers making them talk

But we didn't fuck them up yet, see I ain't like you.

Cause if they buy more shorts they'll suffer more and then they'll go bankrupt too.

Well gotta go they are taking my laptop and my car now

Oh shit, I forgot how am I supposed to send this post ou-

# EDIT: Elon's reponse:

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy

You said your wife's pregnant by her boyfriend now, how far along is she?

Look, I'm really flattered you would buy TSLA calls like that

And here's an autograph for your Mother

I wrote it on the Tesla cap

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the annual stockholder meeting, I must have missed you

Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you

But what's this shit you said about you sold your GME when it fell too?

I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?

You got some gambling issues Stan, I think you need some counseling

To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when your stocks get down some

And what's this shit about us being ""in this together""?

I'm a billionaire lol

I really think you and your wife need each other

Or maybe you just need to treat her boyfriend better

I hope you get to read this message, I just hope it reaches you in time

Before you sell again, I think that you'll be doin' just fine

If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan

Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do have diamond hands

I just don't want you to do some crazy shit

I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago so I bought GME in the dips

Some dude was high on PCP and drove his car to a Gamestop

And ""STONKS"" he screamed, for 24 hours outside the closed shop non-stop

And in the car they found a phone with 0 GME left, but I forgot who it belonged to

Come to think about, his name was, it was you

Dismissed everyone telling me to sell. 
Pulling out half wasn’t an option. 
Not Setting a stop loss was my only regret yet everyone on here was saying not to as they could ladder down and grab stocks and shit. 

I even had like 5 days to think about it. Still all I came up with was all or nothing.I feel too. I looked at my account and it was at 850,000. I didn’t sell, I thought it was just the beginning and I got GREEDY. I had pinched off pieces of my position before and after the run up. I left 500k for someone else. You were not alone and I also got swept up in it. I’ve Been obsessing over this for a week now but I realized I profited 220k and it’s still a hell of a win.Plays like this just make you wiser and stronger. Keep at it. You'll make it back one day.Same story here. Saw my $12k go to about $110k and got wrapped up in the people here saying ""$5k a share limit sell is too low bro"". I then rode the rollercoaster down like a moron thinking it would return. Eventually I cashed out at $24k, just over double my initial investment.

275,What does buying stock do?,"So here is are some questions. Can you buy stock in any company? What does that do to the company?

I am wondering if that is a better act then just buying there products they make. For instance, I'm a big fan of nippon ichi software, if I like the game I played should I buy stock? If a company goes under are you out more then you put in? What is the risk in that situation?

I'm not asking in the since to make a ton of money off it, but more on the level of helping the company. Does buying stock help the company in some way?


I also am wondering what happens if you have a ton of stock in a company. I remember in some older movies if you own the majority of the stock you have say in some of the actions a company makes. Is that actually how that works or is that just movie plot magic?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lem2w0/what_does_buying_stock_do/,"If you buy stock in a company they will make you the CEO. It's a lot of responsibility so choose which stock you buy carefullyWhen a company initially sells stock to the public is where the company gets an infusion of capital. Company takes this money and hires the best and brightest or builds a monster product. Once the stock is sold to an investor, the investor now owns a piece of the company. When ppl buy products from the company it makes money. Therefore increasing the value of the company.

Investors now take stocks they own, which have increased in value, and sell it to someone else. This cycle of selling to others happens 100k times a day. Company has a duty to shareholders to do things in the best interest of the owners.

I own Apple stock because I like Apple as a company. I like their products so I buy their products. Win win in this scenario.Perma ban, unban and ban again.A stock share is a share in the stock of the companyBuying stock does nothing.  That's the simple answer.

When the company does their initial IPO all of the shares are bought by a bank.  The company raises a ton of money.  The bank then sells the shares on the market.  They take a cut. 

Whether the stock goes up or down after that does not matter to the company.

However, the company can sell even more shares to the market to raise even more capital.  If the stock is high they can sell less to make the same amount of money.

Also, many companies pay their employees in stock and stock options.  So by buying stock you are possibly indirectly subsidizing the business.  This is more true than not true but not totally true.

The public stock market is a casino.

Now, theres a little more to it.  If you buy enough shares of a company you can get a seat on the board of directors.  The board of directors may have access to profit sharing.  Think dividends but it's real $$$ not 11c per share or whatever.

Oh that's right, dividends.  Dividends are good for investors.  If you invest in dividend stocks you are exiting the realm of casino and entering the world of investing.

But if you really want to ""invest"" you dont do it in the public stock market.  Unless you have a 10 figure bank roll you arent really investing when you buy AAPL or whatever.  You're gambling.

If you really want to invest you can buy shares of private companies.  These should come with profit sharing.  You are buying a % of their annual profit.  Private investment firms can help you find companies to invest in.  Usually you have to have ""an in"" to even hear about the opportunity.  This might be a friend or family member who works for the company or knows someone high up.

This is like when Ellen DeGeneres recently invested 10m in some vegan food company I forget the name of.  That wasnt on the stock market, it was a private investment, but she did receive shares.

Tldr:  buying shares in the stock market doesnt do anything unless you have enough money to buy a seat on the board of directors.  If you want to actually invest money in a company it is done privately either directly with the company or through an investment firm.BanWrong subIf you are asking those questions here, for the love of god don't buy stocks and run way as fast as possible.It’s trying to learn.

277,Why IRBT might be the next big short squeeze,"Let me interrupt the GME gain porn for a second. I know. GME was (and maybe still is) the opportunity of a lifetime. Most of you think it will never happen again. But I am not so sure about that. In the last weeks it became painfully obvious, that hedgefunds have manipulated the market for decades. They have artificially deflated the prices of some companies by excessively shorting their stocks. That left them vulnerable. And we have just started to expose their weakness. While GME was a one-of-a-kind situation, there are still a lot of overshorted stocks out there. It\`s just a matter of time till retail investors (that’s us) will pick the next one.

I think IRBT is a possible candidate for the next short squeeze. It is both fundamentally sound and in the perfect constellation for a squeeze. Here is why.

**The Company**

iRobot produces the vacuum cleaner Roomba among other household robots. They have a pretty advanced AI and Boomers just love their products. Most importantly, the business is profitable, and the company has grown significantly in the last couple of years. Revenue increased from $656 mil in 2016 all the way to $1214 mil in 2019. For the first three quarters they reported a revenue of $885,6 mil in 2020. In their latest presentation they estimated, their EPS to be around $3.50 for the full year of 2020. This would put the company at a P/E ratio of around 34 at Fridays close. That is not too bad these days. Earnings for the fourth quarter will be released this Wednesday after close. The fourth quarter has always seen a spike in sales due to holiday season. And I think they\`re going to crush expectations. Short Interest data will be updated at the same time.

So we have a profitable company, that is rapidly growing, at a modest price and a potential catalyst. Who the hell would be stupid enough to short this thing?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5euzp/melvin\_capital\_13f\_q3\_2020\_put\_flags/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5euzp/melvin_capital_13f_q3_2020_put_flags/)

Yeah, that’s right. Melvin is. Among others…  
 

**The Setup**

This company has all the potential for an epic squeeze. It is not as ridiculously shorted as GME was, but there are a few other factors in play. Let’s talk about it.

There are 10.5 million shares sold short. That’s 37.6% of all shares outstanding. 

This stock is primarily held by Institutions. The Top 20 hold 48.5% of the stocks according to Morningstar. Most of them are issuers of Index Funds. So these shares will not be up for sale anytime soon. Our experience from GME tells us, that this is quite bullish.

[https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/irbt/ownership](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/irbt/ownership)

IRBT has a market cap of around 3 billion. It is playing in the same league as GME and AMC were before the squeeze.

Furthermore, IRBT is trading at a low volume. Last week there were only a million shares traded per day. This would put the short ratio (days to cover) at about 10. Meaning that shorts would need to buy up the whole volume for two full weeks to cover their positions. It also means, that shorts cannot have covered their positions already.

Due to the low Volume a sudden inflow of buyers would drive the price up instantly. Have a look on the chart at the 27th last month. That was when GME peaked and hedgefunds started to cover their other short positions to rebalance. The stock went up 100% in three days while most other overshorted stocks only increased about 20%. This was probably not the squeeze yet. After the hedgefunds saw GME almost destroy them, they\`ll not sit around waiting for it to explode this time. When the first hedgefund starts to cover, the run to the exit begins. The squeeze will be much faster than GMEs was. I think it will only take two or three days for it to be over. 

 I want you to know, that none of this is financial advice. I’m not recommending buying this stock. I’m also not suggesting that we should pump it up to fuck Melvin a second time. That would be illegal. All I want to say is that I really like this stock. Oh, and today I ate mothballs for breakfast. 

TL;DR: 

IRBT  🚀🚀🚀  Let’s get ready to Roomba!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lelwdj/why_irbt_might_be_the_next_big_short_squeeze/,"Didn't read after ""next big short squeeze""People really think retail investors were the ones that pumped GME to $450 lmaoMan boomers are so silly when they try to act like a retarded millennial.Um.

**What we saw until now:**

\- In a previous post we saw that two retards limit sell orders of 2500$ and 5000$ were successful. 

\- In most media, even the international ones, there is a big emphasis on that GME squeeze is lost. 

\- The media also strongly recommend to sell the shares, learn from our mistake, and move on... As if they have our best interest in mind.

**What didn't happen until now:**

\- The Squeeze

\- Only the retards are currently the ones actively going for the squeeze

**My hypothesis:** 

\-Why only the retards went for the squeeze until now?

\-Why other parties didn't went for the squeeze with us? 

\-Why are we encouraged to sell our shares?

\-Who is going to buy the shares we sell? Only HF? Or other POIs?

Imho the only correlation between most parties involved in GME events is greed. And as long as the squeeze doesn't happen, we should hold our shares, especially the ones with lost porn.

288,but what if we try to invest in GOPRO? (GPRO),"Shares of action-camera maker GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) sank more than 20% at their lows on Friday, and remained down 18.6% as of 3:30 p.m. EST. 

The company announced its fourth-quarter earnings results Thursday night, which showed revenue dropping by more than 32% versus the prior-year period. 

So what
Though the company highlighted the 28% sequential improvement in revenue versus the third quarter, the seasonally stronger fourth quarter fell short when compared to the 2019 period. For the full year, 2020 revenue dropped by 25% versus 2019. 

Now what
Though GoPro reported positive earnings for the holiday quarter, it continued its string of annual net losses that started in 2015. Even after earning $44.4 million in the final quarter of 2020, the company lost $66.8 million for the year. 

GoPro has been focusing on growing its subscription base and a direct-to-consumer strategy. Subscribers grew to 761,000 at the end of 2020, 52% ahead of the previous quarter, and 145% higher than one year ago. The company said GoPro.com generated $116 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, almost double the amount of a year ago.

Customers have been spending on more of the company's high-end offerings; cameras with retail prices above $300 represented 91% of quarterly sales. The average selling price to consumers was up 14% to $323, compared to the prior-year period. 

GoPro's strategy of higher-value products and subscription services is helping turn its business around.

290,IMPORTANT: Newcomers read,"Oh hey fellow retards, I see you hopped onto the stonk train and pulled up to the WSB station. Welcome to the retarded corner of reddit - grab your wife and her boyfriend, put on your special helmets, and take a seat in your timeout chairs. Today we're going to discuss the basics of WSB culture, and a few do's and don'ts. 


*What exactly is WSB?*


We are a sub focused on making million to one odds bets on different meme stonks, typically chosen because of a funny/memelike/autistic ticker or some creatively retarded DD posted by some idiot with no understanding of market fundamentals who likely just barely passed high school (most of us, including myself). As most of us go broke and balls deep into debt from weekly calls, a few of us get incredibly lucky and their gain porn convinces the rest of us to get a second mortgage on our homes. As the crippling debt piles on, we post our losses so that we can show off our huge karma gains to our wife's boyfriend so he thinks we're cool like him. The story *always* ends well.


*Is WSB a movement?*


No retard. WSB was never intended to be a massive movement, and no the goal of WSB wasn't/isn't to ""wage war against the rich"". The goal is to become rich, so to wage a war against what we ultimately aim to achieve is rather counterproductive. If you're here because you think we care about/share your political/economic views, you're on the wrong sub *brotatoe*. WSB is about getting filthy rich, or ruining your financial situation for a majority of your adult life while trying. We don't aim to ""stick it to the man"", we all aspire to *BE* the man. If you haven't noticed, even u/MartinShkreli is a mod here.

Emphasis: *We do not care about your political views.*              *F off.*


*Didn't WSB intentionally orchestrate the GME short squeeze and collapse of several financial institutions?*


Well yes, and no. Yes, the GME short squeeze was a very popular DD being pushed for months - but the reasoning wasn't exactly to wage a war against big financial institutions. The main reason GME was being pushed so hard on here was because people wanted to make so many tendies that they could buy out the Wendy's they work the drive through at. The chaos that ensued because of the shortsqueeze is only an added bonus - Melvin can suck it. 


*""I only came here to join the movement against Wallstreet...""*


*F off*



*Do's and don'ts:*


As I mentioned (so many times, here's some rockets in case you skipped everything else above 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀), this sub is NOT a political movement, posting your politics on here is not acceptable. No matter what political party is currently on top, there are different plays you can make to get those sweet tendies. 

Do not post or promote your pump and dump schemes. Working together is great, what happened with GME was badass - but remember that there's a VERY thin line between teamwork and market manipulation (one of which being highly illegal).

DO enjoy and join in on our culture, call each other retards and autists, talk about your wife being gangbanged by your successful neighbors and you unsuccessfully tryna impress one of her boyfriends. Share your gains/losses - nothing gets me harder than seeing someone lose 40k. Make some ridiculous DD about some obscure company no one has ever heard about, and convince 20 retards to join you because we're all idiots. 


LASTLY - *Don't be a loser.*

292,Let me tell you about my weird ass dream from last night that relates to GME in a positive way. I swear to God this is not me memeing but I chose the meme flair anyway because I'll probably be wrong.,"I'm telling you guys first, but I had a dream last night where I was desperately picking some things off the ground yesterday and then suddenly I was literally dragged upwards (like my whole body was reversed forcefully). 

Even though I don't think about my dreams too often, I truly believe that my dream is a sign of the inevitability of GME mooning this week. I've always believed in the inevitability of GME mooning to greater heights than the ones already reached (that's why I didn't sell).

The shorts (me picking up things desperately from the ground) already know that they're fucked, and you can already guess what getting dragged up forcefully means (us apes buying shares).

In the case that I'm correct, I'm a fucking sage. In the case that I'm incorrect, I can just laugh it off in the end with you guys.

293,Brass Balls,"Sell?? Look, if you were a door to door salesman, would you have this attitude?

No.

You need brass balls. You need to keep knocking on doors and hawking those bibles and vacuum cleaners.

Obviously, if you sell, you lose out on any gains you might make in future. Do you really want to live knowing what might have been? You can always just make more money by donating blood and semen.

Selling means you are saying ""No"" to the future, you are letting the past define you.

Holding, and even buying more, says ""Yes"" to the future. It says ""Yes, I can do what I want! I am in control!""

WSB was all about get rich quick or die trying, which yields a lot of loss porn, a lot of ridiculous DD, some awesome DD, and memes.

Monday 2/1: open at 290, dip to 212, up to 255, dip to 226, up to 277, dip to 240, up to 260, dip to 232, up to 240, dip to 230, up to 251, dip to 215, up to 226 to close out the day.

Day traders are staring at charts, buying low and selling high for a few hours each day. And again, the share price is IRRELEVANT. They go to bed each night holding zero GME stocks, then buying them the next morning all over again.

I'm going to hold to zero instead.Alrighty, OP has only been posting on WSB for a few weeks likes just like most of you other fucks.

I'm not necessarily a veteran myself, but I do have 2 years going at this, so let me share some insights with you.

If you're thinking of doing this, you can't. Or at least you'll find very limited success.

If you have less than $25,000 available in funds, you're limited to 3 day trades a week. This is not a Robinbood rule, this is an SEC rule that applies to all traders, regardless of your broker.

What constitutes a day trade?

Say you buy 5 ABC on Monday during trading hours. If you sell 2 ABC that same Monday during trading hours, that's a day trade.

If you buy 10 ABC just before market close on Tuesday, and you sell them at market open on Wednesday, that's not a day trade and doesn't count towards your 3 strikes.

If you enter into Monday already holding 10 ABC, you buy 10 more on Monday during trading hours and you sell off 8 before market close on Monday, that's not a day trade (because you already started with 10, so you can sell up to 10 before the day trade strike kicks in, deapite the fact that you bought 10 more).

I highly suggest you familiarize yourself with the rules before trying to day trade. There's much more to it than this.To be honest if I wasn't expecting the squeeze at any moment I'd be doing the same thing. I could make so much money buying dips and selling peaks constantly. That is my usual thing. GME is the longest thing I've ever held. I never hold more than 2 days. Buy and quick profit.

This is different. This is huge. And I want to make my tendies.If that dead horse could talk he would tell you to stop beating himYeah but what about the days it was in a downward trend all day? They get fucking killed on those daysWow so insightful, big brain 🧠Teaching the noobs they should day trade so their inexperienced selves can lose more money while veterans can make more.

303,"Please enjoy my loss story, featuring TSLA, shorting, options, one too many Negroni’s and my perfectly smooth ape brain.","Some of you may enjoy this, and writing it down will hopefully ease my pain a bit. It’s nothing earth-shattering, but my sheer stupidity still bugs me.

Last year in mid-Sep I felt super smart buying 100 shares in TSLA at ~440$ and selling a deep out of the money call at my take profit target of 510$ for mid-Dec expiry, which gave me 3000$ (plus another 1000$ for selling a put for the same date also deep out of the money ~200$). 

Move ahead two months and it’s a late evening in mid-Nov: I am in Asia so live US trading is late nights. Had a great night ending up with my special Negronis that made me extra positive and (at least I thought) alert.

Before bed I checked the stock and at ~400$ I had lost around 4000$ on the stock, but the call had reduced enough in price to be nearly worthless, so I was willing to buy it back and sell a new call, ie neutralize my stock loss on the options, hold the TSLA stock position, and perhaps make some extra cash on selling farther out dated and money call.

So I log on my brokerage account, see TSLA, click close position, skim but don’t really read, and click submit... aaaand that’s when my stock position vanished.

I had closed the wrong position.🤦🏻 Instead of taking profit on the shorted call, I had stoploss’ed the stock position. Ie now I had not only realized 4000$ in losses on the stock, I was also sitting on an uncovered short call.

After this disaster, I called it a night and just left the call where it was, telling myself it’s not so risky since the stock will not reach 510$ in one month, so I could just let my shorted options expire for free.

Fast forward a month later: stock is indeed not at 510$, but instead at 700$! I scramble and barely manage to close my call at 16k loss on a dip on expiry day.

1. I took a -4000$ loss on equity position by mistake.
2. By mid-Dec that position would have been worth +16k and by now has doubled.
3. I did this instead of buying back my call at 3000$ realized profit
4. Instead I kept that cursed now uncovered short call, which ended up costing me another -16k to close eventually.

So a 2-3month play with 44k invested that would have yielded already +20k plus by mid-Dec turned into -20k loss (with fees). It looks even worse now, since I of course would have kept the stock position going and get a new long dated far out of the money short call. 🤦🏻

The moral: don’t drink and trade (+my Negroni’s are awesome). Anyways, I’ll use that excuse, but my smooth lazy ape brain likely would have done so anyhow.

My Positions: Long 500 shares @ $11.52, and long (8) July 2021$12 calls @ $2.19

They integrate, aggerate and serve up a large number of airlines, hotels, cruises, and railways for many large travel sites you love and know.  There's 3 major players in that space, they are the  second largest and gaining ground.     Video about  these 3:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o\_bryBG1u8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_bryBG1u8s)

On Feb 19 2020, pre pandemic - SABR traded at $22.36, 78% above it's closing price of Feb 5 2021. On Feb 4th 2021, SABR closed at $12.82, a price not closed above since the beginning of the pandemic - March 4, 2020. It has been trading sideways for awhile now in a channel, and is starting to see some traction and large prints in recent days. I think this is telling, and SABR will continue it's move upward from here. it briefly touched $13.10 at Feb 5th open.

With 317M outstanding shares, the 62M shares short are not super significant, however, there is 102% institutional ownership, and demand for the stock will only increase as the recovery beings to show signs of really happening.

Recent 13F positions show institutional ownership of 410M shares, excluding the 13Gs. so uh, that's 40M more shares than shares outstanding, perhaps that's where the 60M shares shorted come into play also. Not to mention all the owners that aren't required to submit 13F forms. Not to mention call and put positions which I can't see. I know they can play with the dates they submit a bit here, I think overall it's positive data for the stock listed here.

They spent the pandemic upgrading their technology stack and appear to be hiring aggressively.

All in all, it appears we're on the path to recovering from the pandemic, with vaccines being pushed out, and a pent up demand for travel. This stock is in a great position that even if it only halfway fills the gap between today's close and it's where it was before the pandemic dive, you're still looking at a 40% upside from where it sits. I think that is extremely likely to happen in 2021.

316,Why I'm not leaving Robinhood. And why I hate/love Robinhood.,"I was pretty pissed off when RH blocked buying of the meme stocks.  $GME, $BB, $NOK.  But for a different reason than most.

$GME:

I caught the train late.  4 shares.  Bought and sold in the same hour.  Made about $400.  (I'm shocked that people bought at $360.  I've bought some stocks at the top of the rollercoaster before.  But DAMN son, never have I bought a stock that was obviously nuts).

$BB:

Bought some, after seeing the noobs jumping all in.  I set up a stop-loss and my stock sold at a small loss.  If RH wouldn't have froze the stock my stop-loss wouldn't have triggered and I'd have $400 in profit.

$NOK:

Invested (repeat, INVESTED) in $NOK back in October when news broke about the deal with NASA.  Not selling this one for some time.  I have no idea why $NOK was even considered to be the same shit as $GME.

&#x200B;

I was pissed at RH because my stop-loss triggered.  But only slightly.  I was really pissed off because I started the day off intending on buying a PUT $GME.  Cause the bubble was going to burst.  I don't think RH froze trading because of some conspiracy BS.  And I don't really care (because the game is rigged, always has been).  RH probably stopped the trading due to not having the assets to cover the trading.  Not to mention their servers fuck up all the time (they can't handle trade volume at a stupid level).

&#x200B;

I'm switching my main broker over to WeBull.  (I opened up an account with the 4 month ago, just never used it).  The tools they offer and the trading hours are far better.  Downside, they don't offer trading for OTC stocks.

I'm staying with RH (why I love RH)

* so I can gamble on shitty OTC stocks like $RYCE.
* They offer instant deposit and settlement free.
* The interface is good looking.
* They are an American made company.
* I can gamble on fake money.

Why I hate RH:

* The platform always crashes (trade volume too high)
* The app always resets my login time restriction with each update (I hate having to login after a 5min wait)

PSA for the 7 million new subs:

* If you're triggered by words like Retard, you should probably leave.
* If you don't know much about options, stay the fuck away from them.  (I dabble.  If you want to actually invest stick to stocks that pay dividends and have a good history/future.  If you want to gamble try pennystocks.  They are fun.)
* If you have to ask:  Did I miss the train?  You have...
* $GME is not going to rocket again.  Take the loss.
* Don't buy the hype.  Exploit the hype.

$GME is not going to rocket again.  We got one up on the big dogs.  I always wondered if it would be possible to hype a stock so much that it would get to the level of $GME.  But, learned that directing the hive mind is like trying to heard cats.

&#x200B;

The big dogs have already changed their strategy.  They will recover.

&#x200B;

I've said it before and I'll say it again.  One day r/wallstreetbets will be banned at the federal level.

&#x200B;

Other thoughts on RH stopping trading:

* They stopped the use of margin for buying $GME and etc.  Which is something that actually did protect the end users. 
* If the buying frenzy continued their shitty servers would have gone up in flames.  Happens every time a stock goes crazy.
* This was not a freeze on trading for a moral reason.  (legit reasons to freeze trading, example:  Lukin Coffee)",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lehn1x/why_im_not_leaving_robinhood_and_why_i_hatelove/,"Sir, this is the unemployment line.

• SNDL management team effectively manages its cash balance 💵 through registered offerings. The Company has ~$600M in cash with essentially no debt. This means they are poised for strategic growth with low liquidity risk. 

• Political and Macro trends are favoring legalization in the US (~25B  annual market opportunity by 2023) with legalization being brought to the senate we can potentially see this market open up for SNDL by 2022-2023. 

• GWPH was just acquired by Jazz Pharma for ~$7B - companies and investors are taking notice that cannabis is not just recreational, medicinal market is massive. 🌎

• If the company retains above ~$1 for ~5 days then it meets listing requirements for NASDAQ, super bullish signal. 📈

• The call to put ratio is 5:1. Literally 5 calls for every put being bought. This is super bullish because the buying interest will continue to rise. 🙌🏼💎

• Investors are hungry for this stock, even with the outstanding shares recently issued; they barely made a dent in the stock price. 🤤 

Speculation: 45M shares were traded on Friday in two seconds (2/5) this was either a massive buyer coming in or a massive short position being covered. Regardless, some whales have taken notice. 🐳🚀🌱📈

Very cool.I got in at .89 and I’m holding it longer than a bong hit let me tell ya this is gonna be good moneysI like the stockThis company prints stock like it's toilet paper.Huge cash reserves with continuing interest in the company from investors point to good things in the future. The stock is value priced and set to take off once the threat of being delisted is taken off the table. If it stays above 1$ for the rest of the week it should get that boost. 

It has a huge share float, but also huge volumes. Also it IPO'd at 12$ so there are definitely a lot of people holding at higher prices, so unless these people want to take a huge loss they are still holding which ties up a bunch of shares.

Not financial advice. Everyone needs to make their own decisions. Currently in with 10k shares at 1.27.What makes this a better opportunity than Tilray and others?They do offerings all the time but I do think this has major potential for this year. We are on day 4 of 9 of staying above $1. It will get a huge boost after we clear that hurdle.I like sundial. I dont know why. Maybe its because the market for straight flower is very appealing to me.

A lot of other companies boast the medicinal aspect but i kind of like the honesty of it and believe with all the extra capital that they could stand to really brand as they want.

319,Bloomberg: Robinhood Traders Have a Troubled Track Record of Stock Picking,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-06/robinhood-traders-have-a-troubled-track-record-of-stock-picking?srnd=premium](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-06/robinhood-traders-have-a-troubled-track-record-of-stock-picking?srnd=premium)

&#x200B;

Back in May, a Reddit poster hit WallStreetBets with a sure-thing tip on Scorpio Tankers Inc. The oil shipper, trading at one-fifth the value of its assets, was a screaming buy with storage rates soaring, insiders leveraging up and oil vaulting back after briefly going negative.

&#x200B;

There’s an opportunity to see “100% returns within the next year,” the user said.

&#x200B;

Eight months later, the reward: a 17% loss.

&#x200B;

Another WallStreetBets poster was similarly breathless about their bright idea to short Tesla Inc. in 2018. The outcome: a 1,330% loss, not including borrow fees, assuming they stuck with it.

&#x200B;

Picking stocks is hard. Almost nobody has an edge, and it’s no mark of shame when a call fails to pan out.

&#x200B;

But in all the hagiography being bestowed on Reddit traders who latched on to GameStop Corp. before it rocketed skyward, it’s worth remembering that a big enough sample of predictions will always yield a few winners. Evidence of investing genius elsewhere is hard to find.

&#x200B;

It is these cautionary tales on stock-picking that are documented in research covering this era of WallStreetBets. A new paper finds that on average when retail traders on Robinhood Markets buy a stock, it doesn’t perform better over the next three to 20 days.

&#x200B;

In fact, it tends to do a little worse.

&#x200B;

A speculator's record trading GameStop would depend on their timing

“Robinhood investors’ evident lack of skill in aggregate is consistent with commission-free investors behaving as uninformed noise traders,” wrote Gregory W. Eaton and Brian S. Roseman from Oklahoma State University and T. Clifton Green and Yanbin Wu from Emory University.

&#x200B;

The authors also found that stocks with buzz on WallStreetBets see a spike in activity on Robinhood a few days later, a sign there’s likely much overlap between the two communities.

&#x200B;

To isolate investment skill, the academics adjusted 2020 returns for recent price moves and risk factors like valuations and the size of a company. The upshot: When you strip out the possibility that these traders are simply chasing market trends, they don’t actually end up picking future winners.

&#x200B;

The results don’t mean retail investors across all brokerages are bad stock pickers. In fact, the four scholars found that increased buying of a company’s shares by the group overall did predict higher future returns. The problem for the Robinhood contingent is that they typically pile onto a stock nearly a week after the bulk of their peers.

&#x200B;

“Although retail traders in aggregate appear to invest in the same types of securities that are popular among Robinhood investors, we find that the broader measure of retail trading leads Robinhood trading by several days, which may help explain the difference in performance,” the authors wrote.

&#x200B;

The research covers only the first eight months of last year because Robinhood stopped publicizing the number of users holding each stock in August.

&#x200B;

To be fair to Robinhood, it seems likely the pattern is not limited to their platform. Another paper has shown smartphones in general make people more likely to buy risky assets and chase past returns -- partly because apps allow them to trade in the evening without thinking too much.

&#x200B;

Bragging Rights

As the GameStop rally comes back to Earth, the new research may offer a gut-check to amateurs whose bragging rights over the past week reached fever pitch.

&#x200B;

Yet plenty of them would take issue with its conclusions, given how many in this new investing generation appear to have minted fortunes while besting hedge funds -- largely empowered by zero-commission trading platforms.

&#x200B;

When markets were lashed by Covid in the roughly six months through July 2020, a portfolio comprising the most popular stocks on the Robinhood app returned an annualized 105%, according to Wolfe Research.

&#x200B;

GameStop Corp., the poster child of retail speculation, is still more than 238% higher this year even after its recent plunge. Throw in Sundial Growers Inc. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., and the Robinhood crowd would seem to have several stories of incredible success.

&#x200B;

The phenomenon remains relatively young, so firm conclusions about the stock-picking skills or otherwise of those involved might be premature. And to the speculators who have reaped profits on these platforms, it may not matter much whether it was down to picking winners or following the momentum of the market.

&#x200B;

The success of retail traders in general has been documented by various academics across different time frames and methods. In a paper last year, Ivo Welch, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, showed a portfolio of common Robinhood holdings beat market benchmarks and a quant factor model in the two years through mid-2020.

&#x200B;

Welch’s work focused on stocks widely owned by users, rather than those seeing an increase in buying on the platform. The recent paper focused squarely on whether more purchases from the Robinhood crowd actually led to superior performance -- or not.

&#x200B;

“Our evidence suggests that zero-commission investors in aggregate behave as noise traders, with changes in Robinhood ownership being unrelated to future returns,” the academics wrote.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lehbh9/bloomberg_robinhood_traders_have_a_troubled_track/,"Don‘t we have a troubled record with everything boys? lmaoHah hah, they brought up Tanker gangers.

320,Why in long on MNKD,"(credit to u/yoyo_mas_cousin)

Years ago, while holding a true medical breakthrough MNKD who has an amazing inhaled insulin, they would naked short sell the stock daily for years and always coordinated dumps of fraudulent shares with hit piece media articles that would be used to justify the dumps. They pretended that A led to B and it was all a natural process, when in reality naked short selling planned the news drops which were always filled with BS FUD. Seeking alpha was a primary culprit but many others got in on the game.


There used to be a true hero who automatically made charts of all the failure to deliver information that was easily searchable (from SEC data) and you could see clearly the carnage they were not only bringing to MNKD but other favourites they used to attack.


Difference with GME is enough people figured it out before they could bury the stock under 90% losses and demoralize everyone in to selling for pennies on the dollar.


Sirius satellite radio was the poster child for this process, and I believe it was the mercer family who picked it up around 10 cents a share, down 95% plus. The naked short selling rule was called the ""madoff exception"" because Bernie madoff helped get the rule in place ""to help provide liquidity to the market""


Since then, the markets have been completely rigged, and it doesn't matter how many shares are bought of a company the price will always go down. They just need to sell more shares at any point to overwhelm the buying. GME should issue a special dividend if they really want to catch these short sellers flat footed, that seems to be the only real weapon against this fraudulent enterprise.


MNKD still kicking after all these years and seems to be finally winning the war, but the majority of shorts already closed out after whacking the stock 95%+.

323,Revisiting My Favorite 馬: $PDD,"$PDD, or PinDuoDuo, is the stock that I like more than any other stock on the market based on fundamentals and macroeconomics. I will try to keep this short for fellow retards and I will also share why I could be wrong to keep things fair and balanced.

Keep in mind, since Wall Street thinks we are all dumbasses, this stock is likely to go down after I write this post. If it does, I will most certainly be loading up on more stock and a lot more options.

Edit: two months ago, I wrote about a PT for PDD of $180 that the mods removed, but the stock skyrocketed right after earnings. I was right then. I'm right again.

# What is PinDuoDuo

PinDuoDuo is an ecommerce company in China founded in 2015 by a former Google software engineer. The company is pioneering the concept of social ecommerce, an idea that product discovery is best facilitated as recommendations from people in your network. Most product discovery on the web today is driven by searches on the web, so this a novel business model.\* Th company also pioneered a group buying function whereby customers that can get more people to buy with them can get further discounted prices for goods. Until somebody whined about it, PinDuoDuo was the best place in the world to buy a Tesla. 😂\*\*

**By the numbers:**

Market Cap Today: 221 BillionMarket Cap August 2018: 19 BillionRevenue Growth Reported Last Quarter: 89% YoYMost Recent Report of Active Buyers: 737 MillionAlibaba Daily Active Buyers: 757 Million Active UsersRevenue: RMB 14.2 BillionFirst Ever Profitable Quarter: Last Quarter (FY2021Q3)Internet Penetration in Rural China: Grew 13% from March 2020 to June 2020. It's over 50% and growing, there by growing the PDD SAM, or serviceable addressable market.

Some might argue that they have grown too fast, but let's take a look at few key factors.

&#x200B;

1.There is a major holiday around the corner, February 11-17. $PDD has played a key role in practically every single holiday in China. Single's Day was even a huge success for the group buying platform because singles grouped together to give each other gifts for being single. I know for a fact that we can emphasize with those users as a community. This year, I will be buying valentine's day gifts for my wife's boyfriend, and all my friends in similar circumstances will do the same.

On a serious note, the Chinese New Year has begun. It has historically been the largest periodic people migration on the planet. Due to Covid fears and other factors, many families will not get together this year if they live in different cities. For China, that usually means there will be a fuck ton of  food purchased to fill plates that don't have eaters hovering over them. That's the tradition. There will also probably be some gift buying happening for citizens that cannot travel as expression of concern. PinDuoDuo's recent move into agriculture will likely spell historic gains for the business in terms of revenue growth, but also in terms of user acquisition.

2. PinDuoDuo international growth is quietly accelerating. They don't talk about much and I don't totally understand why. [Lots of companies are working with them](https://agencychina.com/blog/pinduoduo-for-china-cross-border-e-commerce/) for cross-border social commerce. The retail market for overseas Chinese with family in China is well in the Trillions RMB. Wall Street just missed here.

3. PinDuoDuo dominates in China's 2nd and 3rd Tier cities. [Tier 1 cities like Shanghai have experienced slowed growth](http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2020-11/10/content_76895684_10.htm), while PDD increases penetration there anyway. Seeing as China is posted the best performing economy of any of the major economies by far, it seems that this fact is more important than the market has realized.

4. Amazing technology. Here is where I laugh my ass off at the Morningstar's of the world. They don't know shit about how hard it is to build good software. PinDuoDuo's software has an amazing track record and they are very focused on improving the customer experience constantly. Customer experience is the differentiator for the business.

5. Not a short squeeze you have to catch the run up or any of that. I like the stock for several years. I expect the company to be the largest retailer in China, the world's second largest retail market and growing rapidly, by the end of 2021.

6. Gradually reducing the cash burn from marketing spend. The reason why PinDuoDuo has only posted a single profit is because of the need to quickly acquire customers in a very competitive and fast growing market. Their reliance on marketing spend is dropping rapidly as they start to win more and more customers through brand loyalty and reputation. Their product is very sticky, social, and nurtured by social network density. We can expect a monster earnings report of 3/10.

My Bullish Price Target: $375

I am basing this on an aggressive revenue multiple that compares their 3-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) with the other leaders in the market. Keep in mind that their 5 year is not available because they haven't even been public that long. The three year figure for them is a monstrous **290%**. If their product catches on in other markets in Asia and parts of the west, we could see that number skyrocket. I hope for them to buy successful brands in other markets, swap the technology for their own, and further improve their recommendation engine's moat with the troves of data they have for operating these systems. If they can penetrate, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Oceania, damn son. My PT is too low. If not, I expect the Chinese market to drive enough growth that this figure is a reasonable price target on a \~45x multiple. Shopify gets this multiple and isn't even as cool. I expect them to partner with mobile device manufacturers and brands to bring a more integrated experience to market over the next few years. The tier 1 city growth also  paints a bright future for the prospects of the stock.

&#x200B;

My Bearish Price Target:  $235

The Chinese market is red hot and due for a cool down. While I think that such a turn is unlikely in the short term, there are some challenges that operating in Chinese pose for fast growing businesses. Some unknowns for me include the regulatory landscape on personal information and how much data  can be used to power personalized experiences for your users. My limited research has suggested that this is not a problem in China like it is in the EU or the Americas, but the right to be forgotten is growing traction globally. There may be some movement in China for reform, though it seems unlikely, that challenges the ability for PinDuoDuo to generate such high quality recommendations. I cannot see the company growing substantially over the next six months for any reason short of a war or political unrest. During the brief period of unrest in the US, the stock market climbed. In closing, if they continue to grow in the tier 1 cities, their reputation for fake/counterfeit products means that they will likely falter at key growth opportunities. Since stocks go up, they gain 30-40 $'s a share on a bad year by my estimation.

Positions:

\~$100 C Jan 22

&#x200B;

\~$250 C Jan 22

If I hit my bullish price target, I will probably only exercise the options and hold for an Amazon ten years because that is very fast growth. I would likely want to take profits on the $250 to wait for a pullback to buy even more options because my bullish target is right for the next two years or so. If we hit the bearish target over the next few months, and only barely get in the money by the time we get into the expiration date, I will likely exercise all options because what a steal. I know the stock will be at $375 in no time.

Embarrassingly, I dropped a lot of shares to join the mega-fucking-obvious GME/AMC short squeezes. Holding those stocks until capital gains at this point.

I still have $270 and $100 call options for next year purchased quite a while ago. I will be entering more options plays for the June earnings over the course of the next several weeks. I will be happy to post those positions here as I acquire them. I am not a technical investor. I invest on macroeconomic trends that impact companies and I am doing quite well. I am also not a financial advisor and do not know shit, but I am very hopeful about the growth prospects of this company. I like this stock.

I call it *The Way of the Autist.*

If you immediately panic bought before you read the actual text of this post, you belong here. If you cannot read this at all, you belong here. However, if you are still reading and have not invested in TIGR yet, it is likely too late, and you should consider an ETF instead.

\*150% YOY growth is insane. Account balances almost tripled YOY! Total number of customers actually depositing and using the platform more than doubled!\*

**2.** **RECENT PARTNERSHIP WITH AURORA MOBILE LIMITED WILL GENERATE FURTHER GROWTH:**

&#x200B;

On January 5, 2021, Aurora Mobile, a leading mobile developer service provider in China, ""announced that it has entered into a partnership agreement with UP Fintech Holding Limited (NASDAQ: TIGR)."" [Source 1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aurora-mobile-partners-leading-online-090000290.html).

&#x200B;

**A. AURORA WILL EXPAND USER BASE AND ENGAGEMENT:**

**B. AURORA'S DETAILED** **ANALYTICS WILL FURTHER EXPAND USER ENGAGEMENT AND GROWTH:**

&#x200B;

Aurora's services and ""machine learning-based data processing and analysis capabilities \[will\] help Tiger Brokers gain comprehensive insights on its user needs, provide targeted and matched personalized experience to cater to user’s interest, and improve user stickiness and engagement, as a result, to conduct dynamic smart operations.""

&#x200B;

This partnership could send TIGR interstellar. 👨‍🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

**3.** **RECENT INSTITUTIONAL BACKING FROM A NOTORIOUS SHORT SELLER:**

&#x200B;

On February 2, 2021, Kerrisdale Capital who has a reputation for making ""successful bets against Chinese internet companies, came out with a long position in"" TIGR, calling it ""The Robinhood of China."" [Source 5](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-seller-kerrisdale-goes-long-203153793.html) (great article for any of you that actually know how to read).

&#x200B;

Now, I know what you are thinking: FUCK ROBINHOOD. I absolutely agree. The mass fraud that they perpetrated on the retail market with GME, AMC, BB, etc. is an absolute travesty. But the point here is, TIGR has insane revenue and user growth and is continuously expanding its business according to available data and information. It's platform is user friendly and is attracting a lot of attention from retail investors, institutional investors, and start up companies seeking to go public via an IPO.

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

&#x200B;

TIGR is the next big trading platform that global, individual and institutional investors are showing an increasing interest in. It has the potential to continue its growth trajectory based purely on its impressive numbers, which speak for themselves.

&#x200B;

Also, I believe TIGR will continue to gain international interest in light of the recent media spotlight on retail trading. Interestingly, the ""government mobility restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic have helped fuel a surge in online trading . . . ."" [Source 5](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-seller-kerrisdale-goes-long-203153793.html). And even though you might not expect it, ""Robinhood's app recorded more downloads than any other U.S. trading app last week despite concerns about its restrictions on transactions."" [Source 5](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-seller-kerrisdale-goes-long-203153793.html).

&#x200B;

**SUMMARY:** Getting into TIGR now is like getting in on sunlight before there was fucking sunlight.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR AGAIN:** TIGR --> 💎🙌🏻👨‍🚀🚀🚀🚀📈📈📈💰💰💰

326,$ELY might be a solid play post earnings.,"Callaway Golf is the leading brand in golf products, they have solid fundamentals and are poised to continue being the top dog in the golf game. They are also profitable, with a profit margin in Q3 of over 11%. Cyclically Q4 has always been bad so I can see a dip buy after earnings. ( see their 2019 Q4 for reference )

Their Q3 income was 475.56 million, I don’t expect Q4 to be that strong and it’s very possible that they post a - EPS due to Q4 and the start of Q1 being the “off season” for golf (unless you are a boomer in retirement who lives in Florida). the golfing industry is a 80+ billion dollar industry and $ELY is poised to continue to capture the lions share of money that is spend on non venue purchases. Sporting and recreation will see more people as we exit COVID, and I predict a great year for the company after earnings on the 10th. This stock has the ability to grow to 38$ a share by the end of the year. Buying golf balls, and clubs is a necessity to golf, you can’t play without them. (Unless you get creative). Every time someone shanks a shot into a pond $ELY has the chance to sell another golf ball. For every new young businessman who has to go golfing with his boss for the 1st time that’s a new set of clubs that get purchased ( or rented if the venue offers that ). As long as the game grows, which it is,( rounds of golf logged in 2020 increased by almost 20%, and female interest in the game has started to pick up ) I see this company steadily growing.  

$ELY also has a dividend that is poised to grow, it’s extremely small right now but that will most likely grow long term. The only red flag I see with this company is it’s 1.24 billion $ worth of debt.

Disclosure: 5 shares at 27$ each

Callaway is by and far my most favorite golf brand and from what I can tell they're doing well with their equipments.

Fake Narrative: We weren't smart enough to get out, we were bag holders, we didn't know the stock market, etc etc. ITS ALL YOUR STUPID FAULT.

Real Narrative: The DTCC demanded large ransoms from brokers and if they couldn't pay then they couldn't buy shares. So the brokers shutdown buying trades and the stock went down. They robbed us blind right before the squeeze happened. Literally illegal robbery. I say we subpoena the dtc and find out who and what and how and why they can arbitrarily determine collateral rates to brokers to the point they can shut down entire stocks!!!!

I mean....are we supposed to accept that anytime a hedge fund gets short squeezed they can just keep doubling down until they win or if they are losing they can just call up the DTCC and have them demand ransoms from brokers?

Funny story. For my broker (DriveWealth), they jacked up the required collateral to 250% for stock purchases. Yes, 2.5x what you paid for the stock, no margin.

Of course, DriveWealth decided they don't want to increase their collateral, so they just halted buying in the impacted stocks.

I can understand 100% collateral, but 250%?Ye because they see how many failures to deliver there are and are trying to cover there ass by not selling more shares.You could always Tweet the CEO of the DTCC, Mike Bodson and ask him for a public statement.   


@ MikeBodson.Counterparty risk is a thing bro.

DTCC works settlement(not clearing, there’s a difference) for literally every broker in the US

100% may have been excessive, may not have. I’m sure we’ll hear from them in some form or another during the ensuing investigations.I just figured it goes hand in hand with failed to deliver shares hence: rasied margin. 

or what?It's all very corrupt.. everyone's known for a long time now.

I went there a couple of times to look at their funkos and thinkgeek stuff. I bought a toy one of those times.

They have plans to pivot, but I still feel like it's a long shot. A digital Gamestop presence against Steam, PSN, XBL, Xbox game pass, PSNow, Nintendo eShop, GoG, Origin, U play, and epic games just doesn't sound promising to me. Look at Stadia. It's dying. Look at Epic vs. Steam. Steam is still killing Epic despite Fortnite and higher developer payments with Epic.

PC gaming? PC gamers are building their own, having a friend build one, or buy gaming laptops. Are they releasing custom builds? They have to compete with NewEgg, Best Buy, Walmart, Amazon, Target, and others if GameStop is selling parts.

The only thing I see maybe bringing them up is esports. 

I don't know anyone who spends thousands on video games a year chomping at the bit for yet another storefront. I think $60 is overvalued, but I'm not going to pretend I can see the future.

Ask avid gamers how they feel about Gamestop. ""You mean the place that bought my copy of Ratchet and Clank for $1 and wouldn't stop bugging me about preorders and magazine subscriptions?""If you hold for a year I don’t see why not. RC should be pretty prolific with his strategy in the news and he didn’t just buy in to hang around. They’ve got stuff in the works.I had a discussion with my brother and I stated I believe $45 is a fair price, back on 1/26$60 is way too high even $20 is optimistic, realistically somewhere between $10 and $20 is what I would say is the actual value of the stock right now.I think it would probably be around $20Anyone who ""likes this stock"" doesn't play video games. Gme was fun, but it's dying.  This industry is becoming or already is direct from publishers to consumers.  One more console cycle and physical media won't exist.   That is the only avenue that makes gme relevant and Idgaf about what Cohen did to Chewy.  Down vote me into oblivion.. you missed the get rich quick scheme... maybe there's a wave 2.. but 2 to 3 years out.. gme is gone.I don't understand why you would want to invest more now when you can probably make better returns on like any decent etf or big tech stock. Hold or sell who cares you do you, but I think you should consider putting the rest of your ~~investment~~ gambling money somewhere else.

Or just think about it this way: you are already making plans for when the stock goes down. So why not just sell what you have and rebuy it later for less money. In the meantime put that capital to work somewhere else. Then you can buy more gme later for a better price with more money. Do you really think it will go up in the next month or two? It might buy I wouldn't bet on it personally.Maybe the $20 it was at right after the cohen announcement, UNTIL cohen announced major restructuring plans or other business initiatives to evolve the business significantly.  Maybe $25.
No two companies are alike.  Until concrete plans and specific action items are announced, it's all speculation whether he has a vision that will work for this specific company.  
For that reason, simply him being on the board doesn't add significant value to today's stock price as far as I'm concerned.  Once we see what the new business plan is, once it's talked about with analysts and we see the company making moves to evolve, that may change.  It will depend on whether or not there's enough faith that it's not going to be too little too late.  
  
Given the uncertainty of the future, whether there's enough life left in GS for Cohen to have time to be able to turn it around or not... I'd want a discount off the fair value today if I was going to buy and hold long term.  I'd personally be willing to buy at $5-maybe $15  and hold long term, once all this shit has died down and the price settled.  
My target would likely change depending on details of any plans Cohen may have for the company.",1612673180.0,20

340,AMC DD - Bullish Signs (Short Squeeze Potential),"DD Copied from [u/SarcasticGuy20](https://www.reddit.com/user/SarcasticGuy20/) (For the cause <3)  


TL;DR: Low risk, high reward.

On Friday we saw the first day in a month that AMC and GME did not follow the same exact pattern. While GME closed higher, AMC fell 3%.

Reason: More shorts.

Fintel reports the GME and AMC stocks being shorted as follows:

[https://preview.redd.it/yruf6hf0wxf61.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=3759124e6d89b985491b41cb52b044f61b334dce](https://preview.redd.it/yruf6hf0wxf61.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=3759124e6d89b985491b41cb52b044f61b334dce)

Why do I think this information is accurate/convincing?

On Friday, GME opened at 54.04, and AMC opened at 7.17.

GME met the most resistance right around 60 dollars, while AMC met the most resistance right around 6.9.

3% of 7.17 is .2151. In other words, 7.17 - .2151 is 6.95.

10% of 54.04 is 5.404. In other words, 54.04 + 5.404 = 59.444.

So within a margin of about 1%, the difference in the resistance of AMC and GME?

13%.

The difference in the amount of shares that were shorted on Friday?

13%.

For the idiots: The growth that GME saw was the same growth AMC would've seen had it not been for a higher short %.

GME closed higher, and rose even more in the aftermarket, AMC \*started\* it's rise in the aftermarket.

[the dark blue for AMC is broken in the spike on the right, it was identical to GME.](https://preview.redd.it/xeng554cyxf61.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e5f913a840d0f1009db5362fa8712572b2d1429)

GME is dangerous, people are bailing on their shorts, some are doubling down. Even MORE people are shorting AMC, it's not nearly as expensive, and there's more volume to play around with.

However, even if you look at these stocks objectively,

Yahoo Finance charts GME as Bearish, and AMC as ""Neutral"" despite the amount of shares being shorted. More importantly in the bottom right, the performance outlook for AMC is positive short, mid, AND long term. People are saying the squeeze is over for both GME and AMC, then why is neither stock dead in the water yet? Why do both stocks show more resistance on days when there is an SSR in place?

People shorting AMC want all the focus to remain on GME while they make money on $1 differences and the spikes in AMC daily. Everyone is waiting until Tuesday for the short reports but who knows if and how accurate those will be, what I do know is the math points to AMC being heavily shorted because hedgefunds and sour retailers want to kill the business before it has a chance to get back on it's feet post covid so they can make ""easy money"".

Consensus: Don't take my word for it, I'm just an ape with a keyboard, and definitely NOT a financial advisor. But AMC should open higher on Monday than it closed on Friday, and if retail gains the sort of momentum that GME had, there will be money to be made, it took months for GME because they kept fighting the re-shorting battle, AMC's $20 spike wasn't relatively close to GME's despite the fact that at one point, AMC's shares were worth more than GME's (pre-hype). If the momentum dies, then so does the stock, and that's what the people shorting this stock are betting on, that's why when GME maintained a high(er) price for months, it eventually squeezed, because the interest + risk of having to pay even MORE money for the shorted stocks caught up to the people shorting it when they realized retailers weren't going to fuck off.

Good outlook, low risk, potential reward while simultaneously fucking shorters?

341,My hopes for GME,"Hi all, this is just my opinion, not advice, don't take it seriously. I like GameStop and am holding 26 shares purchased at an average price of $100, some bought at $21, some at $218.

I think three things need to happen for $GME to go up 🚀🌑.

First, the business has to show improvements. The most crucial factor to convince a 🌈🐻 that he/she should not be bearish is business' growth in customers, services, cash flow, profit, whatever else that can be counted as a good thing. There are many good things going for GME now in terms of new talent in the team, new consoles, all this hype, etc., so I look forward to seeing improvements that tear down the bear theory.

Second, obviously, shareholders need to hold the shares 🤚💎✋ and buy the dips. Moreover, I think community involvement can help: from visiting the store and buying some goodies from them, to sharing good experiences on social media, all the way to reaching out to the leadership of the company and telling them about what is bad and needs to improve (constructive feedback). Papa Cohen, if you read this, I want free shipping on orders above $25 please!

Third, also obviously, the shorts covering their shorts should drive the price up. I strongly believe that this will not happen just because it hurts them in their vaginas. Remember Elon and how he had to invite (literally call out) the head of a fund that was shorting TSLA to visit the factories and see with his eyes that things are for real? Shorters stopped shorting TSLA when they and their clients stopped being 🌈🐻 about it, and not so much because they were bleeding money.

345,$WWE. Can you smell what the stock is cookin?,"Disclaimer: this is my first time actually writing out a DD. I don't know how to add pictures and charts and what not.

That aside, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN BROTHER

Ok, so, $WWE. World Wrestling Entertainment. The shit that nobody has watched since Stone Cold was beating the fuck out of Vince and Kurt Angle was drenching Vince's daughter with white, creamy milk.

The company is not doing great right now. COVID and wrestling do not mix at all. In 2019, WWE had 310 live shows with generally sold out crowds. In 2020, they had 42. Q4 earnings fell 26% from Q4 2019. Revenue was 238.2 million, EPS of 16 cents. Pretty well below expectations. Now, that shouldn't be all that shocking, nobody can go see the shows. So this is a rebound play, obviously.

So here's the good. Starting with Wrestlemania in March, WWE will begin having limited amounts of fans in attendance. By year end, I'd think there is a decent chance at full attendance events. Maybe, I don't know. 

Having full houses soon is the obvious recovery angle, but even if houses aren't full, here's something to consider: WWE on the year as a whole increased operating income to 208 million. Thats a nearly 80% increase from 2019. The bulk of that comes from a rise in content fees. The point here is that even with limited ticket sales, WWE is smart about bringing in money.

One of the less obvious angles is the new deal with Peacock. The WWE network is a big source of revenue for WWE, but its now being completely migrated to Peacock Premium/Peacock ad free. WWE network has cost 9.99 per month forever and generally has a subscriber base of around 2 million. I don't know the details of what NBC Universal is paying for the WWE Network content (which includes every new PPV, every old PPV from WWE, ECW and WCW, and a huge catalog of original content), but what I do know is that as young as it is, Peacock already has more than 20 million subscribers. A lot of that may be free subscribers who won't get the WWE Network content, but assuming a quarter of them are paid subscribers and that 40% of WWE Network subscribers move to Peacock (very conservative), the WWE Network potential audience will reach 6 million people. And this is just a gut feeling, but if you're already paying for Peacock, why not tune in and catch a little bit of Wrestlemania? One of the undersold parts of this entire deal, I think anyway, is the potential for increased ad revenue. Now, Peacock offers an ad free subscription but WWE don't give a fuck. They have ""commercials"" during PPV events and advertise shit all through the show. Those advertisements could reach a lot more people now.

Now, here's the big one that a lot of people don't know about if you don't follow wrestling: the Saudi Deal. WWE is has an agreement to do two shows per year in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis pay 50 million per show. The Saudi shows obviously didn't happen this year, and WWE was not paid for them, it simply extended the contract until shows can resume. The agreement is for ten years.

Now, a hundred million dollars doesn't seem like a ton in the context of a publicly traded company, but considering that WWE raised its operating income, and I'm repeating myself, by nearly 80 percent to 208 million WITHOUT the expected 100 million from Saudi Arabia speaks pretty loudly.

Now, despite the pandemic troubles, $WWE has been trading mostly flat since COVID. It's at 49.23 now, down about 6-7 percent from Thursday close. It hit a low directly after COVID restrictions started at 34.13, but rebounded 44 dollars within about a month. If I didn't mention it before, WWE revenue actually went up this year. A measly 1%, but given the obstacles it's faced I'd say thats actually impressive. 

The timing of trying to play this one I really couldn't tell you. I think there's good room for growth in shares, but I wouldn't try playing weeklies on it. LEAPs I think could probably print you some money.

I'm gonna go ahead and just sort of close this out now cause I'm dumb and I don't know what I'm doing. I much prefer stealing DD from the people here smarter than I am but fuck it. 

Fuck ape gang nobody is gonna see this shit anyway.

Edit: 10 1/21/22 65C",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lef5cw/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cookin/,"Don't let this DD distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.Never throw money in this. To much ladder attacksIt'll always be the WWF to me, nevermind what the pandas sayKurt angle drenching vince's daughter in white creamy milk had me laughing way too hard so I read the whole thing.

I probably won't invest since I'm not familiar with wrestling, will definately put it on my watch list and maybe learn some more and invest later on.

Side note, will definately buy stock on principle if somebody can get stone cold to hit melvin with the stone cold stunnerIf The Rock, Stone Cold, etc. were still around I'd consider it. I don't even know who the hell is on their roster anymore.The Saudi deal has been a PR black eye for WWE in the US, first with women's rights issues and female wrestlers not being allowed there, and again after Khassoghi. Then the bizzare ""hostage situation"" over payment disputes. So there's a lot of anti-Saudi sentiment from both fans and wrestlers.

And who knows how much worse Saudi relations will get under the Biden administration? Don't know how long that deal will continue.

No mention of AEW, the first serious competition they've had since WCW folded either?Did not know that shit was publicI'm gonna be real with ya bro, house shows may not be coming back anytime soon so there is no reason to believe attendance is going to be a driving force for their revenue greatly improving. Seems the TV deals are where the majority of their money is coming from, which does raise the recent deal they cut with peacock that netted them a fuck ton of money. So timing wise it probably depends on how people see that move for them.   


The positive is that it isn't going anywhere. If I had to pick a time for an obvious upswing it would be around next years wrestlemania.   


I'm not a financial guy, but I am a wrestling guy.I don’t know, I think it’s a bit early for a recovery and they still need time to go over this period, price is still pretty high, 2017 levels, let’s see if it will drop further in the next days due to revenue missI don't think I'd ever want in until vince leaves. .until then u can take this stock turn it sideways and stick it straight up u Candy ass",1612671498.0,665
346,DD: Synopsys to the moon,"Hello friends, it is your local cybersecurity investment friend. Today I wanted to provide a quick analysis on a company in the Cybersecurity sector that people haven't really noticed yet $SNPS (Synopsys).

Synopsys derives revenue from two main avenues, semiconductor and integrated circuit designs as well as software security. They also do consulting for both. Electronic Design Automation is 60% Revenue, Consulting is 30% Revenue, Security is 10% Revenue. With that cleared up, I'll reveal that my area of expertise is the software security arm of their business, but I'll write on both areas. I don't want to write about the consulting arm, because bodyshop businesses don't scale well so I think that part is supplemental NOT their core business despite 30% revenue.

# Field-Programmable Gate Arrays and Electronic Design Automation

Synopsys main focus is on developing software for companies to build Field-Programmable Gate Arrays and integrated circuit designs. They help customers design and test chips. They also have pre-designed circuits for licensing as components of larger chips. In addition, they also provide hardware and software verification/validation services for electronic systems.

I'm not a hardware guru, but as far as I am aware this area is highly competitive. Cadence and Siemens are breathing down Synopsys' neck for getting revenue from circuit design software and I don't see a TRUE competitve advantage. BUT it is not my area of expertise, so I defer that to hardware folk.

That being said, as we move towards Decentralised Finance I expect a significant increase in interest in running purpose-built hardware as a means to achieve new business needs. Digital Currency, machine learning, cloud computing, video processing, or even future automotive/vehicle circuits require custom-built, reliable, secure, and performant hardware. Synopsys is able to deliver on all these.

Supply chain risks are now elevated across all industries due to coronavirus and increasingly troubled international relationships. I expect a large focus on managing this risk from nation states by increasing domestic chip fabrication and design where cost-effective to do so. This is to avoid getting locked out of emerging technology by being unable to access chips, should China improve military and commercial routes in the South-China Sea / threaten Taiwans autonomy.

In addition, TSM, AMD, Micron, and Nvidia have seen dramatic share-price uplifts over the last year and I expect a rising tide to lift all ships. Synopsys is quite undervalued in this space and as a Domestic US design shop, I expect to see more interest in their technology offerings.

# Software Integrity

Cyber is a growing industry with a huge total addressable market. Here, I have seen investments in well-known or larger players like Fireeye, Splunk, CrowdStrike, and Cloudflare go well for friends here. Happy to go into more detail about each of these offerings at a later date, but for now let's go with Synopsys as a relatively low-traded stock.

Synopsys' Software Integrity business looks for vulnerabilities in software applications and helps developers fix them, hopefully early and cheaply before they get released into a production environment.

Within the Application Security / DevSecOps space, security tools tend to fall into sveral categories. I can't write their acronyms without Automoderator hating me though. Synopsys does a few of those.

1. Static Analysis - Look at code, find bugs, report. Static Analysis tools function in different ways. Some build normalised syntax tree's (computer science nerd shit, basically think of it as a translation of a book written in 34 languages to 1 language). Others simply grep for known bad words (ctrl+F print each line with that word). There are many open-source versions like semgrep and bandit available as well.
2. Software Composition Analysis - Look at the libraries used in your software for known security issues and provide guidance for fixing those. Generally, composition analysis isn't difficult from a technical perspective, and numerous open source tools exist like OWASP Dependency Checker, nodepackagemanager audit, and so on.
3. Dynamic Analysis - Run your software, then throw shit at it and see what breaks. Useful for quickly identifying areas that crash your app, or ones that cause weird behaviour, but not as effective as a penetration test because they can't cover business logic well. Owasp zed attack proxy is a good example, as well as Community Burp Suite.

# Why not use Open Source?

Enterprises often cannot use open-source security tools due to regulatory concerns around the security OR quality of the tools. Other aspects include lack of support contracts, having to manage it internally, lack of integrations with other enterprise systems, etc. While I have no issue with open source security tools, boards and executives clearly do due to the lack of risk transferral and the advantage of shifting accountability to vendors (See SolarWinds).

# Synopsys Value Prop

Security Vendors focus on having a broad enterprise security offering (Gitlab) or on building high quality but niche security tools (Thinkst Canary, Splunk, Snyk). Synopsys is the former, but over last few years have acquired two of the latter and then integrated them into their enterprise offering.

In the Static Analysis space, there are a few large enterprise juggernauts like Checkmarx, Veracode, Microfocus Fortify, and Appscan as well some smaller players. The general industry feeling is that each of these is cost too much, don't work in new environments, and are generally security compliance tools trying to fit into a devops world.

Synopsys Coverity in comparison was built with more focus on the developer experience. Developer satisfaction and cost generally trump security coverage in the app-sec space, so these ancient security product companies are failing. To illustrate, $MFGA which owns Fortify (a fantastic product from 12 years ago) currently has a 20% dividend at the moment. Not sure how they'll grow their share price or get further investment with a 20% div.

Unfortunately for Synopsys, with most enterprise security products, a stupid long contract has been signed w/ prior static analysis vendors mostly to keep Microfocus in business I guess. There are plenty of legacy static analysis deployments currently rotting in big enterprises so the total addressable market for Coverity is massive. This is assuming they are able to meet enterprise chief information security officers on the golf course.

# Technical Competitive Advantages:

* Broad programming language support
* Lack of mandatory compilation / builds reduces analysis time
* Incremental analysis means you don't need to compile the whole application every time you want to run a scan. 
* Direct integration into integrated development environments helps developers find issues before committing code.
* Lower false positive ratio, less noise is better for developer experience

Sometimes, people think adding features, more vulns types, extra integrations, etc makes for a more convincing product. I think that coverity, by simply being simpler with a  focus on the developer experience will win a lot of product bake-offs compared to competitors.

Another thing to note, these are long term recurring revenue licensing agreements. You won't get immediate bang for buck from these contracts, they are generally paid Month to Month and because of that, Synopsys has to wait for their coffers to fill over time.

# Blackduck composition analysis

Blackduck basically works the same as other composition analysis vendors, although there is a lot more competition now with WhiteSource and Snyk becoming increasingly active in their Developer user experience space. They were best in breed, but I can't confidently say that's true any more.

Composition Analysis is huge in the security world, validating the integrity and automatically reporting (and potentially fixing) supply-chain risks has a huge TAM. Software Engineers pull libraries from anywhere into their software application instead of writing the code themselves, inheriting the risk profile of that library AND the risk of it being maliciously modified. Blackduck addresses this by identifying software with weaknesses quickly, providing guidance, and by providing vulnerability research into potential malicious updates to packages. 

I'm super bullish on all Composition Analysis products as I don't see Software Engineering moving in any direction except for additional code re-use over re-inventing the wheel.

BONUS: Another vendor in this space I'd consider to be promising would be JFrog for the same reasons as Synopsys Blackduck with the JFrog Artifactory Xray offering providing a similar service.

# Summary

\- Synopsys does two things, Chips and Software Security.

\- Synopsys according to their Jan21 Q4 report has been getting increasing revenue across both their Chip and Integriy business divisions despite supply chain disruptions and the covid pandemic.

\- Chips and manufacturing are a huge booming business, a rising tide lifts all ships.

\- Cybersecurity has a large total addressable market. Synopsys focusses on software security and made two large acquisitions over last 3 years. Both are high quality products with a focus on user experience and are now fully integrated into the holistic Synopsys enterprise offering.

\- Synopsys has been doing share buybacks over the last few years, which at least indicates to me confidence in their cashflow and longterm prospects.

\- Assets have improved Q32019 $6.4m to Q12020 $7.3m while liabilities Q32019 $2.3m to Q12020 $3.0m. Revenue slight improvement, Q12019 830k > Q12020 860k DESPITE global pandemic disrupting entire world.

Bearish Factors:

\- High customer acquisition cost, Synopsys mainly targets whale enterprises, so banking/governemnt/military/etc.

\- Acquihired talent lockup ends 2022 for Coverity and 2023 for Blackduck, will see if they stick around.

\- One of their Principal Sales Engineers told me I was a good kid and bought me a coke instead of whiskey at a networking event. Boomers in sales positions :(

**TL:DR Positions:** Synopsys does  chips and software security. Chip companies are mooning. Cyber is mooning. Why not both?

348,The Anatomy of a Coming Disaster.,"Hi.

Some of you know me, some of you don't.  If you DO, I ask that you not shill for me in the comments below, so we can stay within the rules of this sub.

This post is for the newbies, it is written as such, if you already know what delta hedging is, this post isn't for you.  If you *don't*, well, lads and lasses, this is for you.

We need to understand a few basic things here, and in keeping with the spirit of this post, we're going to keep it dead simple.

Market Makers (the big dogs behind the scenes, facilitating your yolos) DO NOT CARE if your options plays pay out for you.  They would be crazy to take on the level of risk that selling you an unhedged call or put would represent.  These guys make money in other ways.  So how can they not care?  Simple, they hedge.  Generally speaking, they buy enough shares when you buy a call so that even if you win hugely, they simply sell the shares they bought when you bought the call, and remain risk neutral.  (Edit, I've been asked to explain that market makers make money by recouping the difference between the bid/ask spread.  While this seems small, they do a LOT of it.)

Why does this matter?

Well, it matters because it introduces *leverage*.  Which simply means it amplifies the effect your money has on the stock market.  

As an example of how this works lets makes up a company.  We'll call the ticker ABC.  And we'll say the share price is 10 bucks.   You, as a degenerate yolo artiste, only have 100 bucks to play with, and you think ABC is going to the mewn.  

Now, you could do the boomer thing and just buy 10 shares of ABC (we'll call this scenario A), but a lifetime of minimum wage and renting a closet for 5k a month has done strange things to your risk management, so you decide to buy calls instead.  You go to whatever broker isn't fucking robinhood and take a look at your options - and there you see it.  For that SAME 100 bucks you can buy ten calls and leverage a hell of a lot more shares.   (We'll call this scenario B) So you do it, you buy the calls.

How does your choice effect the underlying stock?

In scenario A, you bought ten shares, you increased demand for the stock by 10 shares, and this does almost but not exactly nothing to the price.

In scenario B, you bought 10 calls, you made Mr. MM buy a lot of shares to hedge your bet, and you increased the demand for the stock by a much larger number of shares.  (This is an over simplification, but that's what we do here) Which does *something* to the share price.  Even if it's pretty small.
(Edit, as I said, this was an over simplification but I've been asked to address it.  Market makers use a number of metrics to determine how many shares they need to hedge your bet.  It is a lot, but it is almost never 100 times your call options)

Now, if you're part of the ""We like ABC stock"" gang, and 20 thousand of you buy 10 calls... Well, I forgot my calculator, but suffice to say you've just invited market makers to buy a FUCK TON of shares.  Just this, without any actual change in earnings, outlook, of fundamentals on ABC, puts tremendous bullish pressure on the stock *for the term of the option*

And THAT my friends, is the market we find ourselves in.  Talking heads on the news continue to talk about how ""CraZy thE p/E raTiOs haVe bEcomE!!!""  Without mentioning what is actually driving this phenomenon.

Its options.  Specifically since March.  

So with that I'll tell you something pretty goddamn spectacular.  The stock market has become a *derivative* of the options market.  Earnings don't matter, fundamentals don't matter, past performance doesn't matter. The OPTIONS matter. 

This has happened before, in a very different way.  You know how there was a lot of noise in 08 about all the housing derivatives?  We're there again, except for instead of CDOs it's happening with with the shares of the biggest companies in the world.

Want proof?  Go look at 10 day spy chart, right now.  Then go look at a GME chart.  Look what happens to spy, tick for tick, as GME rises and falls. When the entire options meme market is focused on one ticker.

So what do we do about it?  Nobody knows.  I do know this, GME was only the *beginning*.  Retail knows it has the bull by the tail now.  What happens when the stock market becomes a lagging indicator of the sentiment of retail bull chads?

I don't know, but it's going to be *spectacular*.

Edit, much of the thinking around this post comes from months of conversation with a friend of mine.  She's pointed out since I posted this that she has written this up in a way 10 of us will understand in her latest blog post - which can be found here: https://nope-its-lily.medium.com/options-degenerate-marketplaces-part-1-b0ddf1c96fa6",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lef1aq/the_anatomy_of_a_coming_disaster/,"Market makers who delta hedge are aiming to keep their portfolio delta neutral, not each individual trade. As a result, they won't go out and buy opposing equity positions for each option they trade. Instead, they'll pool together delta positions from various trades and only hedge out the remaining delta positions.

Additionally, you can delta hedge options with other options. You're not limited to just hedging with the underlying. You can even hedge with ETFs that have your underlying in their basket or with futures. MMs will typically go with whichever one of the aforementioned choices (along with a few other ways) has the lowest risk-adjusted cost. 

Taking into account the previous factors along with the fact that an options delta to its underlying is <=1, a MM doesn't need to trade anywhere near 100 shares of underlying for each option they trade.

Yes, on average, MMs will trade more than 1 share for each option contract they make a market for, but it's typically not as many as you're expecting.Buy all the options. Got it.>what happens? 

We get another March to shake out retail confidence“The stock market has become the derivative of the options market”..... That’s a great fucking point.

Edit: My wife’s boyfriend also believes it’s a great fucking pointYou had me at leverage. I immediately tried to buy some of these options but it told me something about ""trading hours"", I'm not trying to trade hours I'm trying to trade options. So I called my broker and asked them what was going on and why they're restricting trading (I thought this was America?) They give me the run around and tell me everything's normal and fine but I see through their BS!

Go to your broker right now, don't wait till Monday when they try to hide all this under the rug, and try to buy some of these options and I bet you they'll give you the same shit.

349,I'm feeling the need to point out the difference between covering and closing a short position.,"Edit: What I describe below is called hedging. Covering and closing a short position are the same thing. Sorry for my mistake.

~~**Covering** short positions does not equal **closing** short positions. Everyone doing math trying to prove that GME short positions couldn't have been ""covered"" seems to ignore, overlook, or not realize the difference. No one said they closed short positions, only that they covered.~~ They ~~cover~~ hedge using options (short puts and long calls), which can be anywhere from days to years in expiration, meaning they spread the demand over months, eliminating the squeeze, leaving only slow upward growth.

https://i.redd.it/2cbzawjdczf61.gif

Losing money always sucks. As much as we joke about it, I know how terrible it feels. Bought GME and AMC near their highs like a true autist. Current loss (unrealized) is relatively tame for me, which speaks to just how much I've fucked up this past year. So I thought I'd make something **wholesome** for all my diamond hands out there. **Full 3 min video meme** of Sam's Speech from LOTR is here (WSB doesn't let me embed the full video in the post): [https://www.reddit.com/user/bigbullenergy/comments/lbexr6/if\_frodos\_still\_in\_im\_still\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/user/bigbullenergy/comments/lbexr6/if_frodos_still_in_im_still_in/)

Honestly, the original speech does more justice than my captions. If Sam's words don't give you both life and make you weep as if you bought $800 OTM GME weeklies on Monday, then I'm not sure what will. Let me ask you, did Frodo let Sauron (Melvin in our case) get the one ring (our GME shares)? Ok, maybe he came close, but that's why he had his **gay diamond balled boyfriend Sam** with him to help him stay strong. Don't forget, you've got thousands (perhaps many more) of fellow Sams **holding the line** with you 💎🙌💎. **Don't give in now.**

We've gone through hell and back again, but the journeys not over yet. **We still gotta carry GME all the way to fucking Mordor.** Only then will we see the **mother** of all short squeezes, and all that's green and good in this world will be ours once again.

I know all you apes are experiencing market withdrawal this weekend, but hope you're relaxing. Watch some Lord of the Rings. It'll make you feel better.

Positions: 12 shares GME @ $346.94, 468 shares AMC @ $12.43. Not much compared to some, but it's all I could afford. Please come back for me. Yes I know I bought near the peak.

The title itself is meant to be the literal end as intended, and describes how it would be impossible for all shorts (estimated) to be covered, closed and completely done and finished, with only using the available outstanding shares on the specific days stated. Please note that I have made no comments on possible options that HF's can/did use as* ***I DO NOT HAVE THAT DATA!*** *I have, hopefully, labelled the assumptions I made to do these calculations, and pointed out some general assumptions,more shorts mean more gains, sarcastically, that do not always appear to be true in the given data.*

# These are just general findings, so chill the fuck out!

&#x200B;

Please note that the below plots are all done using publicly available data from FINRA, Jan29th text file ( [http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt)) Feb 5th text file ([http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210205.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210205.txt)) regarding short volumes and Yahoo Finance for daily volume and GME daily prices.

I promise you the long read is worth it, but the TLDR version is at the bottom in Figure 9. The majority of the text is needed to inform a general audience of how an estimate of over 70 million shorts a day was reached. Please help out if there are any huge oversights, or wrong calculations, in the comments below, as I'm not responding to nearly any chats these days due to all the bots wanting me to either join an illegal conspiracy to raise the price of silver, or just shady as fuck.

Below is just a plot of the daily stock prices at the open and close of trading during regular hours for GME (source Yahoo Finance).

[Figure 1: No real new information from this plot that everyone doesn't already know.](https://preview.redd.it/hm1mk6i09yf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bbe89497fafa8b1d449cf203c66ad2b62cbe111)

So as EVERYONE KNOWS, shorts can cause the price to rise in a given stock as the share of stock must be purchased, and with supply and demand, we aim for the heavens...

[Figure 2: Shorts and Short Exempts \(note y-axis is in MILLIONS\) as reported by FINRA during regular business hours.](https://preview.redd.it/t8yyps5bayf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e17249ce1c3e2349d7d082a2690d77bfa4a8c3ad)

So let's do a quick sanity check. Looking at Figure 2, we see that on **Jan 13th, over 40 MILLION shorts were executed!** So if we check Figure 1on Jan 13th, we should expect to see that the price increased, which it did.

Let's look at it a different way and plot the Closing Price minus the Opening Price to see just how much GME stock price changed each day.

[Figure 3: Overall change in stock price from open to close of GME.](https://preview.redd.it/8dutm3frcyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=458d804b49dea6f728ea29f3946a506a6ac2113b)

This plot seems to be dominated by the wild changes in price during late January/early February, so let's do a normalization trick by taking the above values and dividing them by their respective opening price that day.

[Figure 4: GME Price change relative to the opening price that day.](https://preview.redd.it/iokqj1i4dyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=533c7228e8ff52bbb6cc23fe7bc0a145f0716efe)

Now in Figure 4 we can see the change in price relative to what it was starting out on that day. Again we see that Jan 13th increased, by over 50% that day.

So let's make it easier for everyone and combine Figure 2 and Figure 5 to see both the total number of shorts executed, and the price change, for the same day.

[Figure 5: GME Price change relative to opening price, and the total number of shorts\(both short and \\""short exempts\\""\) during Regular Business Hours, via FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/udf0do41fyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af67822fa65e5df33bf2b994c30602f7b8582904)

**NOW WE GOT A PLOT!** Here we see both the change in price AND the number of shorts being executed for a single day.

But what do we actually get from Figure 5? **Jan 13th keeps with our hypothesis that MORE SHORTS MEANS MORE GAINS**, but we don't see that across the board though.....?

Jan 13th, Jan 22nd, Jan 26th, and Feb. 5th all show gains in price, and large number of shorts...

**22 days I tracked, and 11 of those days have over 10million shorts during regular business hours, but only 4 days have gains of 20% or greater, and only 3 of THOSE days have gains over 50%.....?**

# Eye Raise:

* **Why hasn't GME reached the Moon with all the Rocket/Shorts Fuel yet?**

\-""The screaming cries of wallstreetbets""

Hmmmmm, ok, well  maybe we should also compare the overall volume of GME also and not just the shorts. The HYPE was/IS real over GME, and the world took notice. Let's see how the volume changed with it.

First, just plot out the daily volume during regular business hours.

&#x200B;

[Figure 6a: Regular Hours Daily Volume for GME, as reported by FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/8401qqamiyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=308bf45b5b5f75766d96d57ca55bbee0b9c873eb)

Alright, what do we get out of this plot...? Well, from Jan 13th and onward the volume shot THROUGH THE FUCKING ROOF, compared to early January.

**BUT WAIT A DAMN MINUTE?!?!?!?**

I didn't hear about the GME Hype Train until mid to late January!? From what I can find googling it seems that most major news outlets didn't really report on WSB/GME until Jan 21st, with serious mentions coming around Jan 24th weekend.

# General Assumption I'M MAKING:

# Most of the actual ""Retail Investors"" didn't join GME until weekend after Jan 22nd.

[Figure 6b: Full Daily Volume as reported by Yahoo Finance for GME. Note that Figure 6a is contained within Figure 6b.](https://preview.redd.it/bxnpcbheuyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fe167ab117d9d361f7f2926d85bc837319dcf33)

# So, ASSUMING, the above, let's say the higher volume AFTER Jan 25th is from Urist McLossesMoney.

So what's with the crazy high volume before then? Is it from the insiders, the true chosen among us, the users in r/wallstreetbets that aren't bots?----->NOPE.

Almost certainly volume before Jan 22nd is from the hedge funds having to buy up the shorts they WAY THE FUCK overextended on! The ""big bois"" had to join us bottom feeders and buy up the stock to cover their 9000% short shares... maybe.

Anyway we can check something else that to shine some light into what happens during the dark hours of trading... After Hours Volume.

[Figure 7: Regular Hours Trading compared against After Hours Trading for GME](https://preview.redd.it/dzjkv3zqlyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=30b68bc546184bc5e079101a4c9d9d66b1955365)

**I DO LOVE PLOTS!!!!** Here, I've taken the regular hours volume(again from FINRA) and subtracted it from the day's total volume, as reported by Yahoo Finance, to get the After Hours Volume. But again what stands out/what's the point of this plot?

# After Hours Volume overtakes Regular Hours Volume Jan 22nd, and has remained where MOST of the action is going on!

**GENERALLY**, ""Retail Investors"" don't/CANT engage in after hours trading. And also, don't confuse what you do on your trading app at 2am with what broker-dealers and big bois are doing at 2am.

We see around Jan 13th, after hour volume went above 50million, my general dumbass guess is because HF's needed to buy shares to cover shorts, and the few following days thereafter.

Hmmmm. OK, let's take a step back and look shorts again....

&#x200B;

[Figure 8: Percentage of Regular Hour Short Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume during Regular Hours.](https://preview.redd.it/kolo2hw7ryf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=da005e3f065d05341a1fa196c07c9b3b3523793b)

Figure 8 just shows that over half of all volume, just during regular hours, are shorts. **I don't know if there are numbers out there that show after hours shorts, if so PLEASE COMMENT IT!!!!!!**

# And because I can't get after hours short volume, we have to make a wild guess as to this next step.

# So multiply Figure 8 by Figure 6b and you get.....

[Figure 9: Estimated the full daily short volume by multiplying the regular hours short ratio from Figure 8 by the whole daily volume reported by Yahoo Finance.](https://preview.redd.it/yscv7o1ssyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=86594c24fa071bee2a7b7b2e25f607241c13e9b3)

# NOTE: Figure 9 is an estimate, but it's still a low-ball estimate.

**ASSUMPTION --> Let's assume that after hours volume plays just like regular hours trading.**

I STILL HIGHLY FUCKING DOUBT THAT AND WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF AfterHoursVolume was higher than 75% of just shorts.

Still, let's roll with Figure 9. **Looking at Jan 13th, we estimate the number of shorts executed was...over 76 MILLION!**

**And there are.... 69.75M shares outstanding... yep... ok... checks out!**

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Go to Figure 9, NOTE THAT IT'S AN ESTIMATE(and a low one at that), and see how it's impossible that they covered their shorts (ON THOSE DAYS) see edit below.**

I'm replacing my comment with u/caraissohot 's correction:

~~**Covering** short positions does not equal **closing** short positions. No one said they closed short positions, only that they covered.~~ They ~~cover~~ hedge using options (short puts or long calls), which can be anywhere from days to years in expiration, meaning they spread the demand over months eliminating the squeeze, leaving only slow upward growth.

From u/caraissohot:
>Wrong. Covering a shorts means buying the stock that you shorted and closing the position. This is very easy to google. There is not a single definition that agrees with you. If you cover a short you are closing it.

What I described is called hedging. What remains is that for GME it doesn't really matter if the shorts are covered or hedged. The possibly-formerly-large-short-sellers are no longer under massive pressure to cover.

So Clover Health, they use machine learning to personalize the Medicare experience for each specific patient to lower healthcare costs through improved decision making. Their growth is tied to virtuous cycles (positive feedback loops) by using improving machine learning to continuously lower costs over time. Currently CLOV annual growth rate is 38%. Hindenburg recently released a negative report on the company that brought down the stock price 15% in the past few days, but it’s started to turn around Friday. It’s down from it’s all time high of $17.45. Could be a good buying opportunity.

Anyone who knows more about the company have any further insight? I got in on the dip on Friday.

Except Jennifer goes out and buys her own popsicles from store..... and the stores are saying they have at least 900 popsicles ready to go.... so Jennifer says I want 300.... but now the stores say hey.... we really only had 100 and Kenny just bought the last 100.... so now the popsicles are all
Gone! 

NO ONE HAS POPSICLES. So now Kenny can go sell them for as much as he wants because supply States so.

 **Summary**

* Company represents an excellent deep value prospect for long-term investors.
* The company has an excellent operating history but was slammed by the current downturn.
* Leverage is not unreasonable and once the company turns around, it will offer strong upside prospects.
* New fad of collecting Pops!
* Shares rallied \~25% in the aftermath of reporting third-quarter results.
* This is due to a broad earnings beat in Q3 alongside a general recovery in the markets for names tethered to economic recovery.
* It's impact from the pandemic bottomed out in Q2, and though revenue is expected to be negative through Q4, Wall Street expects a return to growth next year.
* Company trades at only \~15x next year's EPS estimates and \~8x the earnings it generated in FY19.

This company is an iconic modern-day toy company. Despite its status as a fast-growing, quality firm at the height (so far) of its popularity, the company has been slammed by fears related to retail shutdowns. Investors have panicked about deserted malls and sent shares of the firm spiraling down in recent months. Near-term pain is over and the company’s prospects improving, now might be a good time to jump in and consider buying up a piece of the enterprise on the cheap.

**A great operating history**

Operating history of this company has been, over time, really impressive. Take, for instance, the case of revenue. Between 2017 and 2019, sales at the firm grew 54.1% from $516.08 million to $795.12 million. As sales at the company grew, the company’s profits improved as well. Back in 2017, the company’s net income totaled just $3.94 million. By 2019, net profit had grown to $11.73 million. Before we move on to other metrics, the firm’s net profit does warrant some discussion. Despite the company’s strong brand name, it has been unable to capitalize on it in the way that can generate attractive margin. Even in 2019, its best year on record, the company’s net profit margin was 1.5%. It’s a positive that this trend has been improving, but until margins grow substantially from here, the company is at risk of a bad year really hurting it.

While bottom line wasn't great during shut downs, its other operating metrics are attractive. Operating cash flow, for instance, totaled $90.77 million. This was more than triple the $23.84 million in operating cash flow seen two years earlier. Even compared to 2018, this metric is up 81.6%. This works out to an operating cash flow margin for 2019 of 11.4%. Another important metric, Adjusted EBITDA, has also done well. Back in 2017, this metric totaled $90.03 million. This grew 36.7% to $123.04 million by 2019. This margin works out to 15.5% for 2019.

**It might be time to jump on board**

There’s no doubt that it is being hit at the moment, but it’s important to keep the eye on the long-term outlook. Though management has provided no long-term guidance for the business, its operating history prior to the pandemic suggests that its future will continue to be bright once the crisis is past.

If we use metrics from 2019, its price/earnings ratio of 17 looks quite high. Its price/operating cash flow multiple, though, is far lower at 2.20. Its EV/EBITDA multiple on that basis is also low at 2.94. This makes the company a clear deep-value prospect. Even if we annualize the firm’s first quarter EBITDA, its forward EV/EBITDA multiple is still quite reasonable at 7.60, which means that **it is cheap** now if we assumed that the future of the business would look a lot more like this year is likely to look.

**Takeaway**

Based on the data provided, it’s clear to me that this company presents investors with some very attractive prospects at the moment. The company has a nice operating history. Its cash flows are particularly attractive. Right now, the business is being hurt by the global pandemic just like most firms across most industries, but once this pain passes, the upside from here could be quite significant. **It is a great reopening investment and also great play on collectable fad that staying at home has ushered.**

I got in with $350k when I saw the GME [venture capital valuation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) post from last month. Mostly shares to help the short-squeeze cause, but a small amount of margin, and about 10% on ATM calls dated one month out. 

Within 2 weeks I was gaining or losing $1 million every hour. Kind of intense. Not something I intend to do again. 5/7 with rice, though. 

I should have sold at $420.69 as originally intended, but I needed to give it the weekend. The hype was so intense, that from a sentiment/bubble investing standpoint, Thursday was just too early to let go. In the first hour of trading on Monday, though, it was clear that the **INSANE** amount of noise about GME last weekend wasn’t because more people were coming in… it was just because the**💎🤲**  were getting noisier.

367,"Lemming: a disparaging term for an investor who exhibits herd mentality and invests without doing their own research, which often leads to losses.","Ok guys and gals, one of the greatest strengths of this community is that there are always people who are willing to check your work, give a different perspective, alert you something you may have missed, or poke holes in your DD.

Now there are millions upon millions of us, with our collective knowledge and experience this should make us one of the greatest forces on the planet right?

If we continue to berate and downvote everyone who has a dissenting opinion, we will not succeed. You will collectively run off a financial cliff, while those of us who do know what they are doing will empty the pockets of your dead bodies.

I encourage everyone to learn as much as possible, understand what the folks that post DD are saying, ask questions and contribute to this community for everyone’s success.

Not everyone is a bot, or out to get you and it is ok if they have a different point of view than you. GME has spoiled us, stocks are never this easy but they could be if we used our collective knowledge and experience.

[Lemming Effect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lemming.asp)

TLDR: Don’t be a Lemming, dissenting opinions are ok, learn while you are here, I am not a bot, and I don’t work for a hedge fund.

GME 25 @$59.50",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lecqwd/lemming_a_disparaging_term_for_an_investor_who/,"Lemmiwinks?Did you know that lemmings don't actually follow each other in large herds off cliffs and that this idea actually came from 1950s Disney film? Found this out the other day...

https://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/lemmings.htmI'm glad I was in wsb before it blew up. There's a big contrast from current wsb to wsb from just 3 months ago. I'm amazed people are still so hard for GME. I thought the posts would have dropped off like PLTR did by nowAlso be aware that having too much money riding on a single position makes you less likely to heed or consider opinions that goes against your confirmation bias.

For example, I didn't get in on Gamestop but I have $14,000 in Monster Beverage. So when I tell you ""So what if teenagers might be dropping dead from chugging 20 energy drinks in 2 hours? It's a free country."" I might not be offering the most clear-headed opinion.Hey that's me!An opinion vacuum never leads to good things, and is just a not-great way to get information period. 

Personally I joined this sub originally because I was really interested in the takes that DFV and some of the people who respected him had. I dug that idea of using the system to screw over people who screwed the 99% (and continue to). As someone who worked hard to build a 401k and the lifestyle I have now—which isn't much but is comfortable—I felt confident enough to give the WSB casino a go, even though I'm not a gambler and think the whole idea is dumb. Gambling for a ""cause"" though, I could justify, haha.

I snagged 60 shares of AMC during the last ""campaign"" and I'll be keeping them until I feel like it. Something really unfortunate about the last couple weeks is that a lot of people who didn't do research and didn't read the fine print about this sub (a.k.a, sir, this is a casino) lost a lot and now are very bitter. Due diligence when it comes to investing/saving/spending money in GENERAL is so so so important. Especially in **this** kind of environment. Hype trains can be costly rides. And a lot of younger folks don't get it, they just want that rush of being a part of something. It's cool to be part of things for sure...but you HAVE to set a limit. Otherwise you've screwed yourself over for a fruitless thrill. 

You talk about not being a lemming, like a few posts I've scrolled by here, and honestly it IS a good point. Circle-jerks are knowledge voids. You have to at least **listen** to some differing perspectives even if you don't believe them or aren't going to entertain them in any tangible way. You can be diamond-handing things all the way, but at least try to do it because you feel informed enough to hold those diamonds, vs just running with a crowd.

Didn't realize this sub was full of drama at the mod levels sooooo in lieu of that weirdness this will be my last interaction here. BUT I'm really thankful to the community and this sub overall for giving me an unusual crash course in investing. I certainly learned more about using my Fidelity account than I ever have from anyone 1:1! r/investing will be my next stop to keep learning more. And maybe in a few months or next year I'll be sitting IN a theater as a proud shareholder.The best thing the ""enemy"" has done is completely destroy any credibility the community has right now. Regardless of post, good or bad, comments claim you're a bot, a shill, brainwashed, etc.

Every post about GME means the person can't let go. Every post about a different stock means they're a shill.  Any post that seems to have good DD means it's a probable pump and dump. It's a shame

Where have the originals migrated? I randomly stalked this community from time to time but only recently joined. I think it was under 3 million when I joined so a pretty good increase from typical but way before thebig infiltrationHerd mentality rules here.  It’s like the Elon Musk fan club “he cares, he really cares”.  We need a sub for anti lemmings.I remember i used to play Lemmings on an Apple computer back in the 90s.

368,Food for Thought," 

I wanted to take a time-out and lay out some of my thoughts on everything that has happened in the last few weeks. This was always about seeing the VALUE in the future of the company, and making a play on that value. Yes it was shorted an extreme amount and we saw the potential in the short squeeze as well. There were many excellent DD's written about both the company and the potential for the short squeeze along with possible scenario's for this. I personally didn't think we would see any drastic change in price until after Q4 ER, but look at where we are now.

With that being said, I want to focus on several things that have happened over the course of January, how it impacted us, and why this is still continuing today. I will start with January 12th, as this is when things started to get interesting.

Jan 12th:

GME closes around $20.

Jan 13th:

GME opens around $28

GME closes around $31

Jan 14th:

GME opens around $35

GME closes around $40

From January 14th to close of January 21st, GME trades sideways between $35-$45. Later that evening on January 21st, something crazy happened....

WSB was taken down, and a picture was put up that said DoJ, FBI, ICE, and Europool had seized this ""hidden site"". Like what? Its a public forum.... ok, anyways. WSB is down for an hour or two, and when it comes back up, there's a VERY interesting post from a guy that says there are much bigger players involved in this, a shitstorm is brewing, and he has proof that the mods have verified. The top comment is from a mod that said he had verified OP's sources. I barely got to read through the post once along with the mods comment before Reddit kicked me out and the app reset on my phone. Boom, post is gone, and a few people mention seeing it and wondering wtf that was all about. Now we get to January 22nd, a Friday.

January 22nd:

GME opens at $47

GME closes around $64

Most if not call options are ITM. Gamma squeeze time. Hype had started to creep in during the weekend. We open Monday like this:

January 25th:

GME opens around $117

GME closes around $76

At some point during this week, I don't remember exactly which day, the media started attacking us. Bots started to fill up our beloved subreddit, and our lines of communication were hurt while we sorted through the bullshit.

January 26th:

GME opens around $87

GME closes around $150

January 27th:

GME opens around $370

GME closes around $350

January 28th:

GME hits above $500 in premarket.

Before markets officially open, RH and other brokers decide to block all buying, and allow only selling. Fidelity and a few others did not participate in this, the majority did.

GME closes around $200

January 29th:

GME opens around $330

GME closes above $320

When GME closed above $320, most calls were ITM (cant remember if we had $800c options yet). Lots of media saying the squeeze already happened, bot attacks, media saying we are pumping SLV (wut? lol) or random biotech companies, and negative posts from bots / whoever the fuck else.

February 1st:

GME opens around $240

GME closes around $220

I don't think I need to recap the next couple of days for you, it is burned into our minds, but several important things happened. DFV was called to testify on the 19th of February in front of the House Financial Services Committee. On Wednesday our sub was compromised and tons of negative sentiment flooded in, a lot of new members posting the diamond hand spam, etc. Our sub is most likely still compromised, and we don't know when we will have it back.

So lets highlight what they have done so far:

1. Discredit DFV in the media, and call him to testify.

2. Break our lines of communication by compromising our subreddit.

3. Sow doubt and fear amongst us with the flood of bots and negative sentiment. We have suspect accounts posting gain porn from GME, downvoting or telling people to sell, and spamming the sub with other bullshit.

4. Restricting demand of stock while it is flooded with supply. This wasn't lifted until Friday, in which we saw our first green day of the week. (**FUCK ROBINHOOD IN PARTICULAR!** We don't care if you want to blame it on the DTCC, you caved in, plus, where did that 3bn in additional capital come from you managed to raise by Thursday?)

5. Paper Portnoy getting his million followers to jump in and subsequently sell for a loss. I truly wouldn't be surprised if this was a ploy by the men up top to pump and dump the stock and scare everyone into selling.

6. 4 days of red before restrictions are removed and demand catches back up to supply (price dropping increases demand also via opportunity cost). Keep in mind, a lot of people were transferring holdings over to new brokers and had money tied up until Friday, when we see our first green day.

Let me be crystal clear here, if they have to tell us we have lost, yet still attack us, then we haven't lost. There is a LOT more going on here than just retail vs hedge funds. This is not over, and the big players know it. Most of us here from the beginning are here to see it to the end, as it was always about the future value of the company. To our brothers who bought at the top and are still holding, we are coming. It may not be next week, it may not even be in the next few months (I'm still eyeing Q4 ER), but we are coming. I don't care if you think the stock is overvalued at $66.50. I don't give a fuck if you sold for a loss. You don't realize any gains or losses until you sell. Buy the dip and average down retard. I will be holding because I can afford to hold, and I believe in the future of this company. I am not a financial professional, just a smooth brained retard. I do hold positions in GME and have been in since $14.

This is not financial advice, just sharing my thoughts.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*Great informative post, the WSB take down you mention is new news to me though, anyone get a screenshot or other references? 

I am new so interesting to hear about the Q4 ER patience from people holding, I am holding what can afford to lose and risk even if just to be part of the story. Like you, I think ""may not be next week, it may not even be in the next few months (I'm still eyeing Q4 ER).""

I am hoping in support there will be a steady stream of news about the company transforming itself with new management team having greater funding avenues now to drive whatever digital transformation strategy they come up with, maybe an acquisition along the way :) And I also think there are hedge funds on our side of the long/squeeze equation now as they know the tricks and want to make a buck from the overstretched short.

Obviously like other apes here I consume crayons, am not a time traveller and have no idea what will actually happen in the future.I think you are being too conspiratorial about the trading restrictions. We've been over this before, many times. There was a 10-fold jump in the clearing house deposit. They had to pony up 3 billion, and couldn't do so immediately, and had to limit buys since they couldn't afford the collateral. 

They eventually got emergency funding and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp accepted 700 million instead of 3 billion, which was a lucky break that allowed them to start allowing buys again (as in, they could still put down more collateral for future buys). A [recent article on bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-06/robinhood-s-collateral-crunch-explanation-puzzles-wall-street) suggests that they should have been able to anticipate this, but they failed to do so. So maybe they messed up and now their company's image has taken a permanent blow. Their PR at the time also backfired and seemed condescending, simply because they were scared to admit that they couldn't afford it.

Either way, that's why the trading had to be restricted, it has been fully explained. They literally could not pay the deposit to facilitate trades in certain stocks with exceptionally high deposit requirements. 

Unless you or anyone else has evidence that this is wrong, then maybe the consensus among experts is right after all.Wolf of Wall Street is my favorite movie 🍿Can we ban the conspiritards?",1612663403.0,53

Earlier, [u/OneRivenPony](https://www.reddit.com/u/OneRivenPony/) posted this: [GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze : Wallstreetbetsnew (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/le714j/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/) It was awarded and upvoted all the way to the top.

Unfortunately, OP didn't detail the most important information about that Bloomberg Terminal screenshot he posted. Institutional Ownership information is based on the filings that each institution has reported. These filings are not required to be updated weekly, or sometimes even monthly. Some institutions (depending on their ownership percentages and level of involvement) aren't required to report changes to their ownership percentage for 45 days.

That 177% institutional ownership image that Pony linked to is just an aggregation of all filings that the SEC has received. There is no way to tell real-time data on who owns what percentage of the float. Here is a comment from another user over in [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) that posted a screenshot of the ownership details for the top 20 sources that Bloomberg is pulling. This is from a Bloomberg terminal he has access to..

Credit [u/T\_per](https://www.reddit.com/u/T_per/)

>Fact is this is based on a false assumption. The terminal warns you that institutional ownership is outdated and may reflect a higher than 100% holding.  
Either OP doesn’t use the terminal often, or neglected to read the warning.  
I have terminal access too and can post screenshots in a bit.

375,ATTENTION: The 'official' data released on Feb 9th might be completely wrong,"Good morning/night/afternoon my fellow apes,

On February 9th the official short interest % will be released, with all the short sellers having to report about their short positions to FINRA. *Correct me if I'm wrong*, but I'm pretty sure the short sellers CAN and WILL lie (not surprising after all they've done) and the worst thing that will happen is to them is - you guessed it - a fine that'd be dwarfed by their gains if people believed the damn number.

So don't be spooked if short interest data looks off/too low on the 9th. Posting this as a lot of people say this will be the 'make or break' info. They'll fuckin lie

377,Extreme lack of DD posts,"There seem to be hardly any new DD posts. Why?

Now some people say there is something fishy going on and the mods are still compromised.

However I would want to give the benefit of the doubt. Maybe GME is still so huge that no one wants to make good DDs or alternatively there actually aren't any good DDs except for people trying to push penny stocks. In any case there have only been 3-4 DD posts over the past 48h.

For over 4mil active members, that's hardly anything.

If people have experienced DD posts been taken down for no rule violation, then please repost the text here as a quote in the comments.

@Mods: this is supposed to generate transparency if it gets traction. If good DDs are thrown out due to a spam of Pennystocks or stronger enforcement of rules, then we can easily assess this here and it gives the community a transparent view on the DD situation.

Somebody fucked upCan someone else independently validate that this is a real unaltered screenshot from Bloomberg? If so, this is a really big deal. Diamond Hands 💎 ✋BUY BUY BUYThe numbers Mason, what do they mean?# number of buyers = 69

THIS IS OUR SIGN, DEGENERATES! 💎🙌So if i extrapolate this I believe I can guesstimate the % short (and the number mean what i think they do- please correct me if I’m misunderstanding)

Institutions own 142% of shares. Let’s assume there are 200,000 shares - actual amount is irrelevant. 284,000 is 142%.

And then that is 177% of float. 284,00/177% is 160,500 shares. 

160,500 + 284,000= 444,500. 

200k shares
244k short

244/200 = 122% short. 

Basically unchanged since last official short % annouced. 

What’s more to unwind, 244/160= 152% float. They would need to buy every share and half of the rest. 

THIS IS ALL CONJECTURE ON WHAT I BELIEVE THOSE NUMBERS REPRESENT

382,AMC Stock: A Retard's Short DD," TL;DR: Low(er) risk, high reward.

On   Friday we saw the first day in a month that AMC and GME did not follow  the same exact pattern.  While GME closed higher, AMC fell 3%.

Reason: More shorts.

Fintel reports the GME and AMC stocks being shorted as follows:

[https://preview.redd.it/yruf6hf0wxf61.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=3759124e6d89b985491b41cb52b044f61b334dce](https://preview.redd.it/yruf6hf0wxf61.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=3759124e6d89b985491b41cb52b044f61b334dce)

Why do I think this information is accurate/convincing?

On Friday, GME opened at 54.04, and AMC opened at 7.17.

GME met the most resistance right around 60 dollars, while AMC met the most resistance right around 6.9.

3% of 7.17 is .2151. In other words, 7.17 - .2151 is 6.95.

10% of 54.04 is 5.404. In other words, 54.04 + 5.404 = 59.444.

So within a margin of about 1%, the difference in the resistance of AMC and GME?

13%.

The difference in the amount of shares that were shorted on Friday?

13%.

For the idiots: The growth that GME saw was the same growth AMC would've seen had it not been for a higher short %.

GME closed higher, and rose even more in the aftermarket, AMC \*started\* it's rise in the aftermarket.

[the dark blue for AMC is broken in the spike on the right, it was identical to GME.](https://preview.redd.it/xeng554cyxf61.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e5f913a840d0f1009db5362fa8712572b2d1429)

GME   is dangerous, people are bailing on their shorts, some are doubling   down. Even MORE people are shorting AMC, it's not nearly as expensive,   and there's more volume to play around with.

However, even if you look at these stocks objectively,

Yahoo   Finance charts GME as Bearish, and AMC as ""Neutral"" despite the amount   of shares being shorted. More importantly in the bottom right, the   performance outlook for AMC is positive short, mid, AND long term.    People are saying the squeeze is over for both GME and AMC, then why is   neither stock dead in the water yet?  Why do both stocks show more   resistance on days when there is an SSR in place?

People   shorting AMC want all the focus to remain on GME while they make money   on $1 differences and the spikes in AMC daily.  Everyone is waiting   until Tuesday for the short reports but who knows if and how accurate   those will be, what I do know is the math points to AMC being heavily   shorted because hedgefunds and sour retailers want to kill the business   before it has a chance to get back on it's feet post covid so they can   make ""easy money"".

Consensus:   Don't take my word for it, I'm just an ape with a keyboard, and   definitely NOT a financial advisor. But AMC should open higher on Monday   than it closed on Friday, and if retail gains the sort of momentum  that  GME had, there will be money to be made, it took months for GME  because  they kept fighting the re-shorting battle, AMC's $20 spike  wasn't  relatively close to GME's despite the fact that at one point,  AMC's  shares were worth more than GME's (pre-hype).  If the momentum  dies,  then so does the stock, and that's what the people shorting this  stock  are betting on, that's why when GME maintained a high(er) price  for  months, it eventually squeezed, because the interest + risk of  having to  pay even MORE money for the shorted stocks caught up to the  people  shorting it when they realized retailers weren't going to fuck  off.

Good outlook, low risk, potential reward while simultaneously fucking shorters?

Stop living in denial for two fucking seconds and listen. The ONLY reason GME got as high as it did was because of the media. It was portrayed as a “David vs Goliath” story which started a buying frenzy that everyone wanted to be a part of. I know you dipshits don’t understand how the stock market works but I’m sure you can understand simple supply and demand. 

Look at the chart. You can literally see the day it became national news, and like most things, it was viral for a few days followed by NO ONE GIVING A SHIT EVER AGAIN.

So that’s it. Here we are with GME back to reasonable volume, backpedaling it’s way to a more reasonable value. If you have shares you have two choices, hold because you think the return from this point will be stronger than other investments, or sell because you think it won’t. What you paid for the shares has absolutely nothing to do with it. “Diamond hands” isn’t a admirable ballsy move it’s idiot speak for “I’m too scared and dumb to determine if I was wrong and need to move on”.

If you do hold, you need to realize it will be a while. You need to stop constantly checking the price, stop telling yourself you will wake up tomorrow and see it at +100%, stop coming on here looking to confirm your beliefs. Find something else to do to occupy your time before you lose your mind.

This whole goddam page is people bragging about holding and then scumbags like you who make whole new posts to complain about the already annoying post.PREACH.What you say seems reasonable until you actually fact check your statements.  ""Here we are with GME back at average volume.""  Yet 2/5 volume was 80.89m shares.  2/4 was 62.43m.  2/3 was 42.7m.  2/2 was 78.18m.  2/1 was 37.38m.  During the run up in late January volume was 180m to 200m for 3 of the 4 days in the run up with the last day being 100m shares.   Yet average volume in December was mostly in the 6-10m range with the odd day in the teens.

So we are nowhere near average volume.  Now I neither know or will guess what that means, but things are not ""normal"" with GME yet. 

But let's look at a few things.  Most say the ""float"" at GME is a tad less than 100 million shares.   So with the shorted, loaned and reshorted stock being some multiple of that around 1.22 X, there is about 125 million shares sold short.   Now it is possible that the total short was covered in the 4 up days as there was total volume of 620 million shares that changed hands at that time.

However most of the ""talking heads"" were calling that a gamma squeeze due to the crazy amount of itm call options requiring massive buying by market makers.   If that was true than those 4 days were not short covering, but buys by MMs.   Now you can tell me I'm wrong and I will happily listen to the reasons you have.  But here are mine.   Hedgies that have made billions are not in the business of shorting in the teens or even 20 and covering in the hundreds.   Not when they can pay the interest on their short positions for a few extra weeks or months and let the gamma squeeze go away and the WSBers get tired and scared and sell and leave and they can cover in the teens again or in the 20's and all that costs them is some interest.  So my position be it right or wrong is that there is still a massive amount of stock that has been sold short at very low prices and eventually will have to be covered unless the stock drops back to $5/share on its own or because people are fooled into thinking the squeeze is over.   

Now on newly shorted stock at higher prices.   Ok, I can see that a number of people if they could borrow stock last week did so and added to the shorts, however those we don't worry about or even have to think about because they can cover anytime before the low price shorts cover and make money.  And I do not think there was enough availability to have those new shorts be any kind of large volume.  Simply because there were not enough shares left to borrow to sell.   Even if there were, who cares.  They could buy now and it would only pop the stock $30/40 share over part of a day.    It is the guys holding the shorts they made at $20 that have to cover.   Maybe some of them (a small handful) panicked and covered at insane prices in the hundreds rather than biding their time and continuing to pay interest but I do not expect that was much of a group compared to the 125 million shares sold short at low prices.Everyone will be on palantir in two weeks.

386,My fellow autists... Palantir ($PLTR) has arrived.,"**February 19th** is when the lockup expires for Palantir.

Are you ready to buy the dip on the next company we get to tell our grandkids about?

February 16th is their earnings report. Which they most likely are going to blow out of the park. Granted this goes well; we look at February 19th when the lockup expires. Do insiders sell at all time highs? Most likely to unload some of it and pay themselves. This is a BTFD opportunity on a company that has potential. They're rare and only visit us once in a while.

387,Abcellera- 02/12 Earnings and Potential Against Competitors,"Hey everyone,

This will most likely get deleted due to my account not having enough to karma. I just wanted to start a discussion regarding Abcellera. In my opinion the Peter Thiel backed company is extremely interesting and has a potential for large-ish revenue in the future due to royalties. 

However, at the moment the company has extreme disparity between market cap and revenue that makes me somewhat uncomfortable. Especially in comparison to its competitors like CERT.

What is everyone’s thoughts on this?

388,"Listen, Disney is going to the moon! Read why my fellow WSB YOLOers!","Made the biggest due diligence today - Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)

Firstly, Disney is a strong competitor to Netflix with their streaming service, Disney+. Since its release they have pumped subscription numbers that only Netflix could dream about. Disney is not only trying to increase their revenues through blockbuster movies, but also by dragging new viewers to flagship series such as 'The Mandalorian' and more recently, 'WandaVision'. On top of this they are planning to produce more Marvel series (they own Marvel Studios daah...). These series will most likely be starring big boi action figures such as Electro, Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus, Doctor Strange and Thor. I don't know shit about these characters since I could care less about The Avengers (all I care about is stonks).

Secondly, Disney will rocket to Pluto when the Pandemic is over and they open up their amusement parks. All kids and/or your wives kids (from another boyfriend/husband) will beg their parents to ride Mickey Mouse's Roller Coaster and Disney is going to pump the revenues like they never have before. Do you remember when when you were a kid and always begged your parents for stuff? Well that is going to happen with both Disney+ and their amusement parks. Kids will cry till their parents take them there.

Thirdly, invest on your own risk. This is only food for thought! I will give you some more spicy investment advise should I be successful. No Profit & Loss, Balance sheet and Cash Flow stuff here, just pure future prospects, a.k.a. YOLO.

Damn grandpa this is some cringey shitDisney might be a good play but it will not go 'to the moon' for sureEconomy is shit and unemployment is crazy high. Thinking as soon as the vaccine is out and the parks reopen it will be the a moon is absurd. 

Disney + has been out for awhile and most people already subbed due to covid making them stay home with kids and stuff. If anything I think they may see cuts as kids go back to school and with money being tight . . .

As far as the parks go when they reopen yes it's good for business but again with the economy the way it is I don't see the same numbers of people vacation anytime soon. Thinking it will be higher then ever is a pipe dream.

My 2 cents, goodluck though.Price target? Disney is at an all time high as is

392,Is Melvin still shorting GME?,"Hey guys just want you all to check my smooth brain math and tell me what you think.

My understanding is that Melvin Capital held a short position of approximately 40% of GME shares, or approximately 38M shares.

E: 38M is a worse than worst case number 40% would be approx 28M. Also I don't even know where 40% comes from I've just seen it around reddit a bunch. It's probably much higher than reality.

Melvin reported losses of approximately $6B in January well before the share hit $300 and claimed to be out of their position on the ~~22nd~~ 26th when the shares were worth approximately ~~$50~~ $150. But for the worse than worst possible case scenario let's use $300 share price and see if the numbers add up.

https://www.tradingdirect.com/pricing/Interest-Rates#:~:text=The%20formula%20for%20the%20interest,Corp%20at%20%2425%20per%20share.

>The formula for the interest calculation will be: (Market Value x Rate x # of days) / 360.

I have seen the rates for GME reported at an insanely high 10%, let's assume worse than worst case scenario and and call that 15%.

Let's also not worry about complicated integrals and assume the price was $300 every day of january.

So, ($300 * .15 * 30) / 360 * 38,000,000 = $142,500,000

Last time I checked $142.5M is a whole lot less than 6B using every possible worse than worst case scenario. Seems like their losses were probably incurred exiting their short position.

I'm pretty uninformed, what am I missing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leberf/is_melvin_still_shorting_gme/,"Probably opened more short positions in the $300 range during the squeeze.We find out Monday.  Which hand filled faster.   The wish hand or the shit handIf you can provide a verified statement showing their $6B losses then i would certainly believe they closed a substantial amount of their shorts, if not all.

But you need to consider how since August 2020 Melvin have always doubled down and increased their shorts even while the GME price continued to climb from a $4 low, so i wouldn't really trust anything they said to the media without some sort of verification. Even then a $10-$20M fine for misreporting would always be less than losing billions in the stock market.

Edit: best that i could find: ""Melvin Capital Management, the hedge fund that has borne the brunt of losses from the soaring stock prices of heavily shorted stocks recently, lost 53% on its investments in January, **according to people familiar with the firm.**""

https://www.wsj.com/articles/melvin-capital-lost-53-in-january-hurt-by-gamestop-and-other-bets-11612103117I bet they are.Idk let me go ask themEveryone hold the bag: YES!
Everyone who paper handled :NO!I speculate that They bought shorts at $450 and rode it down to the low, covering. This most likely made the HFs a sizeable amount of cash. However, the volume and stocks available doesn't support them being able to cover their positions even in the fallout.

Then, once the stock plummeted HFs most likely purchased MORE shorts, synthetic or not, to push it to zero.

So, where are we? Nobody knows.

However, I think it is HF vs HF. There are many Call Options in place. So there is big money wanting this stock to push back up to ATH. This will cause bagholders to jump out, add more capital in a second wave of new investors, and pinch the Short Betting HFs.

Similarly, the short betting HFs will continue on with their gamble for the above not to happen  and push this to zero.

My prediction is greed. The stock will rise substantially over the next few weeks taking it to $500 or higher, allowing for the Calls to make cash, and once that is over-- for the shorts to make another epic run toward zero. Everybody wins....and loses.If the next level fuckery around here is any indication, I’d say yes.

By fuckery I mean reverse psychology and increased SUS activitity.We all will know on Tuesday when shirts report come out.. who is bluffing...What if he shorted at $4 and covered at $10 during the rise? Then after everyone piled in, he bought a fuckton more along with everyone else, and shorted it again?  Now he covers the shorts at $63.00 after buying at ~$300.",1612659209.0,41

What a legend. The [full article](https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/) is not behind a paywall or anything, it's a good read. 

Here's some parts of the article.

> Shares of KBIO had bottomed at 44 cent on November 16th, 2015, but then quickly spiked back to over $2.00 on November 18th.   Most observers attributed the rise to some simple (but unexplained) short squeeze.  As “an obvious zero”, KBIO attracted many small retail short sellers, looking to “play the fade”.  In fact, there was a very good reason why the stock had been spiking up from 44 cents.
> 
> After the close of markets on November 18th (just one day after KBIO received its delisting notice), KBIO announced that an investor group led by Martin Shkreli had just acquired “more then 50%” of KBIO’s shares.  So this is why the share price had spiked from 44 cents.   When the market opened the next day, KBIO skyrocketed from $2.00 to over $14.00 on staggering volume, as terrified shorts scrambled for the exits.
>
> After the close on November 19th, KBIO released a second announcement, stating that the group had now acquired a full 70% of outstanding shares and that Shkreli had been appointed as KBIO’s new CEO and Chairman.  Shkreli’s group had stated that it would inject an initial $3 million in cash with an additional $10 million following shareholder approval.  By November 23rd, KBIO had briefly hit $45 per share.  But, even then Shkreli was not yet finished with his plan.
> 
>  After briefly hitting $45, KBIO quickly retreated into the $20s.  After all, it was still just a defunct biotech stock without a real drug. Even with a bit of cash from Shkreli, the stock was worth nowhere near a market cap of over $200 million.  Short sellers piled in to short more in the $20’s on the basis that “this was just a squeeze” that would quickly fall apart.
>
> As KBIO’s share price had been spiking, short interest had been growing.  And Shkreli now owned 70% of the outstanding shares.   Then on Thanksgiving Day 2015, when markets were closed, Shkreli tweeted that he had decided to recall his KBIO shares that had been lent out to short sellers.  The resulting squeeze was just a simple math problem.  When Shkreli recalled his shares, brokers would be forced to buy-in the short sellers, causing it to spike uncontrollably.
> 
> When the market reopened on Black Friday for a shortened session, shares of KBIO continued to squeeze higher reminding some investors of the Volkswagen/Porsche infinity squeeze from 2008.  Shares surged 31% as shorts trampled over one another to close their positions.  The stock again surged back to as high as $45, and remained elevated for weeks thereafter.We're on the wrong timeline when people think WSB was a protest against wall street and greed lmao.

405,What happens when people buy the wrong stock...Over and Over...and cause a short to panic!,"So the Canadian stock Green Thumb Industries Inc. Which trades under the symbol GTII on the Toronto stock exchange has gotten a lot of attention lately due to legal weed. Well that stock trades as GTBIF on U.S. exchanges in U.S. dollars. The U.S. Stock GTII is a dirt cheap penny stock that is Global Tech Industries Group, Inc. Well, when I was looking to buy Green Thumb a few days ago I accidentally found myself looking at Global Tech...Which led me to wonder how many others might make this mistake. It turns out a LOT of people. Now what happens when volume spikes massively on a gently shorted over time penny stock? Well the short at first doubles  up thinking it's free money.

 However, when you get multiple days of spiking volume the short probably starts to panic. Imagine you've shorted millions of shares of a podunk stock with 50K a day volume and suddenly people are buying it up? You're going to burn.

I've been watching this. I got in at $0.24...and then got out thinking it was over...But no, I got back IN for bigger and more! So Friday it closes up 115% at $0.86 with over 2,000,000 shares traded.

424,I am $LGND 🚀🚀🚀,"$LGND DD

I seen on the box, the bird, and the printz  that LGND was part of the WSB squeeze however other then a few post that seemed largely exaggerated. Even if it’s an industry plant it seems like a good play, maybe even a a lay up for a short term grab. Probably some value in a long term play also. 

The play 
LGND has been buying back shares for the last 3 years. Reducing total shares from 21 mil to 16 mil. Average price paid per share on the buyback was $105. The shorts are already 62% of the float which is second to GME.  However, it appears that as much 9 mil shares are owned by insiders. 5 mil shares are actually owned by Investment 10 llc since 2014. Investment 10 appears to not be very active with only a handful of sec fillings mostly signed by a management fund. This LLC being largely inactive, I believe suggests that it belongs to one of the head insiders. This is big because 30% of the float is likely owned by someone who rarely trades shares- by their filings. The 5 mil plus the other insiders is near 9 mil insider ownership. 

16 mil float - 9 mil insider shares= 7 million available 
10.01 M shorted (62% of 16 mil)
21 days to cover 
*Average volume 1 mil shares 


Catalyst 
LGND beat earnings and shares jumped up $22 dollars on Friday— the risk of a squeeze is more and more likely with any significant push in volume.

Background info 
If hedgies ran a pharmacy. Ligand began as a biopharmaceutical company and failed then reinvented itself as a pharmacy  investment bank and also happens to be run - to some degree by investment bankers.

Sure as shit hedgies piled up on it to drive it to the ground.“Odeon Capital analyst Alexander Arnold earlier today upgraded Bed Bath & Beyond to Buy from Hold with a $38 price target, reversing his downgrade to Hold on January 27. The recent selloff in the shares has ""overshot fair value,"" with the ""Reddit exit providing an opportunity for more pragmatic investors to build positions at a discounted level,"" Arnold tells investors in a research note. The analyst sees upside potential of nearly 50% to current trading levels. Bed Bath remains Arnold's favorite story in the entire retail complex given the ""strengthened"" balance sheet and long-term strategic plan by new management. He believes Bed Bath is the third inning of a ""long-term pivot"" that will create ""significant investor value for at least the next 3-5 years.""

Bed Bath and Beyond stacks its merch too high (to the ceiling) and overall vibe comparison between the two is as follows:
Bed Bath Beyond: trip to the doctor
Home Goods: comfortable value feel of a Sandals Resort - is it top tier? no, but are your kids not there and you’re drinking in the sun seeing pretty things?  YES

The smart money play here was for someone to tell TJX (owner of HomeGoods) to get their ‘ish together with online sales and an Ap for HomeGoods.

427,ELI5 on Why the GME Rocketship is Done,"There’s been a lot of Misinformation on GME ever since it mooned last last Thursday. I’ve spent some time grieving my losses and want to make sure normies with diamond hands know what they’re getting into. In the simplest terms:

Reasons why GME rocket engines will fail:

- Another gamma squeeze is very unlikely. $800 OTM calls exist for hedging. Also, this thread explains the conditions of a gamma squeeze for apes. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1kor/the_gamma_squeeze_explained_gamma_theory_for_monke/

- Short sale restrictions lift on Monday. Expect more dips until GME stabilizes at market worth.

- If short interest is still >100%, that doesn’t mean that GME will squeeze. Shorts have been short at >100% for months and the conditions for rocket launches are no longer attainable.

- Robinhood and other brokers messed up, but it’s unlikely anything will change. The reasons they gave on why they limited GME, AMc, and meme stocks are enough to appease the SEC.

- The ITM calls that expired eod Friday will not cause a gamma squeeze

- Most folks who are deep in the red are experiencing internal struggles and facing the prisoner’s dilemma, will cash out at break even, and that’s ok

Wildcards:

- If institutional share owners decided to diamond hand GME like Porsche did Volkswagen, GME would reach Pluto

- which brings up the question, why do they own >100% of available shares?

- FTDs, if they are ever investigated, would probably make something happen

- don’t know the validity of this, but apparently an emergency shareholder meeting would force all shares to be called, also forcing shorts to cover. This sounds like fake news tbh so idk.

All in all, I’m just a retard, this is not financial advice

My position: 

115 shares avg @ $403

Down almost $35k

**edit1: forgot to add, I’m diamond hands on GME, a true re t a r d hoping for a cosmic event to unleash the Squeeze of legends. I just hope that my fellow apes can come to the bleak realization that they should probably look for new plays to regain losses since the stock market is still the Wild West at this point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le99vk/eli5_on_why_the_gme_rocketship_is_done/,"I've cashed out some profit from the first spike and have a diverse portfolio so I will.hold what I've left in.

What are you getting out of stressing out people who are already stressedIf anything, I keep mine for a reminder of hype buying and not selling at a good profit (for me)... also possibly to average down. 5@$330Funny thing is if enough people collectively believe the price will go up... GME will pull a TSLA and the price will mysteriously go up and there will be bears shitting themselves from here to their cave. The fact that so many people on so many sites are independently forming a bullish thesis hilariously will lead to the price going up because stocks often trade on psychology, not economics.

429,Why was robinhoods excuse bullshit?,"I am definitely not the most knowledgeable about the stock market and how it works, I just know the basics, so I was wondering why robinhoods excuse for restricting GME shares is bullshit. Everyone here seems to blame them for it and to me their explanation of the clearinghouse deposit requirements seemed to make sense.

Now I am not defending them at all, Im just acknowledging that Im pretty much a casual idiot in these sorts of things and was wondering if someone could explain why their excuse doesnt hold up, as Im guessing if everyone is blaming them this much then there must be a hole in their logic Im not seeing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le913o/why_was_robinhoods_excuse_bullshit/,"It's a fairly legitimate reason, but they handled it in the absolute worst way possible by suddenly removing the ability to buy but allowing selling with no explanation, then claiming it was to ""protect"" the users because of volatility.robinHood was fined 26 mill only two months ago company has been nothing but sketchy..source: [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321)NSCC (clearinghouse) can arbitrarily change deposit requirements which is what happened. [Listen to Vlad explain what happened on the Clubhouse interview with Elon Musk.](https://youtu.be/aicDIMtVld8) 

From his interview, it seems like a bunch of people/companies came together and made the decision for NSCC to raise the deposit requirements on RH and some other brokers. They likely did this to protect HFs and themselves from going bankrupt and also probably because of the looming liquidity crisis if the squeeze kept going. I blame this 100% on HFs who thought it was a good idea to short a stock over 140%.I’m just curious why everyone believes it was a liquidity issue when Vlad himself repeatedly denied it: “Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev shot down speculation on Thursday about the company's finances, telling CNBC's Aaron Ross Sorkin ""there was no liquidity problem."" Source is the business insider article. So a) we have a CEO who is manipulating the stock by lying to the public. Or b) we have hedge funds manipulating the stock by paying shills to lie to the public. As a shareholder, I’m not too happy about either one.Bullshit because they selectively restricted certain stocks and the restriction of those specific ones directly benefited Citadel who paid RH $12million in December alone to rout trades their way....thus they appear to have manipulated the market for a business partner by killing demand in that they blocked buy orders but accepted sells which flooded the market with stock that no one could purchase and drove the price down. Citadel has direct interest in Melvin Capital (gave them 2.75 billion to stay a float) who was primarily responsible for shorting a lot of those restricted stocks and needed the price to stop increasing.if you don't have a robinhood account open one. Get your free stock... sell it and leave Robinhood. 8 million free stocks is a lot of free stocks. GO RETARDS!! 🦍🍌 United we stand. I am not a financial adviser. I like FREE stock. I don't like robinhood... ps if your friend has robinhood have them send you a referral link... that's 2 free stocksFuck skinny Adam Driver ... punk ass bitchIt’s not bull shit, however it is extremely convenient that their biggest client citadel asked them to put up 4 times the collateral while they were invested heavily in a fund that was short GME$ and getting absolutely slaughtered and would have vaporized that investment and that fund.  Vlad can’t say something nefarious is going on for obvious reasons, he just needs to stick to his script like a fucking robot suit and he will get out scot free and continue to become a billionaire.  Robin Hood relies on citadel for free trading*(it isn’t free as you may have found out) however their whole business would go under if they started charging people for trades.RHs excuse was fine. People are looking at the wrong institution. 

DTC/NSCC are the ones who raised the deposit massivelyI think Robinhood was somewhat forced by the clearinghouse that processes their trades. Still, they should've told their customers immediately.",1612652020.0,2

435,GME Institutions Likely DON'T Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze has likely Squoze,"Y'all honestly just believe anything anyone says without looking into things for yourself.

I'll admit, I am not entirely familiar with Bloomberg Terminal but I use ORTEX and know that a shit ton of the data is usually outdated.

In the [other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/), OP states that ""up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings states institutions currently hold 177% of the float.""

[Bloomberg states here](https://data.bloomberglp.com/professional/sites/10/Security-Ownership-fact-sheet.pdf) that they use a company's 13F filings to determine security ownership data.

[You can see here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-13f.asp) that 13Fs are only required to be reported quarterly and some institutions purposefully choose to hold off data until the very last day (45 days after end of quarter) to file theirs.

Meaning the main data that OP of the other post is using **is outdated** by at most 4 months.  It doesn't matter if Bloomberg says that it's updated as of today because **companies don't report their fucking trades every single day**.

It is entirely possible that when the Short Interest was at 120% 2-4 months ago that institutions held 177% of the float as that means there were 60M actual shares and 72M synthetic shares created by the shorts, and institutions only had to hold 106.2M of the 132M total.

And it is more than likely that after a shit ton of those shorts closed and a bunch of retail got trapped at a $300+ cost average that the % held by institutions will go down considerably.

[Max Pain Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp#:~:text=The%20maximum%20pain%20theory%20is,a%20case%20of%20market%20manipulation.) on even normal securities is controversial, let alone on a stock that went through a short squeeze in which all of those written puts will be hedged against.

Short Interest is also a lagging dataset but S3 and ORTEX both try to estimate it.  ORTEX does so using data from lenders, brokers and broker-dealers who submit inventory and [they believe SI is below 29M](https://imgur.com/hdMd2UL) (too lazy to get an updated screenshot but it's at 26M as of Fri).

I won't even go into the fact that [borrowing fees](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) are back down to 3.7% and Interactive Brokers has shares back that are now lendable.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le8u1s/gme_institutions_likely_dont_hold_177_of_float/,">I won't even go into the fact that borrowing fees are back down to 3.7% and Interactive Brokers has shares back that are now lendable.

Biggest indicator right there of what the real situation is.If you guys and gals want to be good at this stuff, then you need to learn how to read the data yourself and not decide that it’s true or false based on someone’s post history.OP sure seems to have spent a lot of time bashing GME these past couple of days for someone who hasn't posted anything before a week ago. If you catch my drift.So what do you think of the FINRA report coming in Tuesday? I don’t trust anyone’s data at this point, to include, Bloomberg and Ortex. They are estimated and probably work well for normal flowing stocks. GME was not normal.Hedgies file 13Ds or 13Gs when they make a major position change, retard. 13Fs are quarterly but 13Ds and 13Gs are filed within 10 days of when they change their position. Bloomberg uses all of these forms.Comments date back about 2 days and 1st and only post on a 7 year old account you fake cuck suck my dick melvinFirst off I don't know where this will go. I just want to say I do find it interesting that there seems to be well thought out DD on both sides. I don't think it's as simple as 'believing anything' ... there was a post just last night that tried to break down the volume -- well reasoned and the math supports it (it did have the issue it didn't cover this week). At this point, I'm not sure what to believe so not confident in either side really. I am really hoping that sometime in the future we do get the full picture of what happened.Owning GME is like having a piece of the Berlin Wall. Lol. I am holding itI noticed a big shift today. All the positive GME DD is gone, all the gain porn pouring in for GME, all the negative DD showing up.... if we are comprised as a sub, it’d appear they are priming us to sell, to FOMO the gains... however beware... Monday we aren’t on short sell restrictions and I think there is enough shares to drop price again due to shorts. If I was in their shoes I would try to hit 9% loss every day this week. 10% would trigger short sell list again and we’d get a Green Day.. this is pure conjecture and all of it is just the ramblings of a smooth brain. Think like the enemy, know their intentions, know their ammo....I am now 100% convinced that we are on the attack by reddit alongside with a select WSB mods that sold out. This is far from over.

441,BB: My totally not made up girlfriend who lives in Canada,"This is not financial advice or an attempt to convince you to buy. I am merely sharing an opportunity I believe exists because the market has not yet come around to how BB has repositioned itself.  

There’s also better DD on Blackberry than this and if you’re interested you should search it. 

**TL;DNR why BB?**

1. Because they are a key player in the ridiculously lucrative software fields of advanced AI, cyber security and autonomous vehicles. 

2. Because they are criminally undervalued based on their partnerships and future prospects (more below). 

3. Because there is value. This is not GME, there won’t be another GME. But like GME in the fall when shorts didn’t understand the gaming cycle, there is a gap between prevailing opinion and reality. 

**Don’t they make boomer phones?**

No. They don’t make *any* phones. In fact they sold all of their phone patents to Huawai. They have completely reinvented themselves as a software company and are on the cusp of a monumental turnaround. 

**Wait, so what do they do? (This part is IMPORTANT)**

Software. And not just any software, but software that the market generally values extraordinarily high. 

They are about to be dominant in automobile operating systems. Seriously. Blackberry. As u/gangusgun pointed out their QNX OS is in more than 175 million cars. They inked a deal with Baidu to develop their autonomous vehicle. They inked a deal with Amazon to develop and market BlackBerry's ""Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform"". They inked a deal with Sony to provide the basis for their EV. Their integrated system will be mass-produced and available on Guangzhou Automobile Group electric vehicle arm’s upcoming GAC New Energy Aion models. GAC has a joint venture with NIO. 

19 out of 25 EV companies currently use QNX. **With GM and others moving away from ICE in the near future who do you think they’re going to partner with? Mother. Fucking. Blackberry.**

Amazon. Baidu. NIO. Sony. (And SpaceX but that’s unrelated to cars). Do these seem like bad companies run by stupid people to you?

And yet, the market is still valuing this stock as if it’s making phones, rather than being the eyes and ears of every vehicle on the road. As u/forshakuras pointed out in their DD that you should really read if you have any interest in the company, BB is valued at $6.5B despite $475M in recurring revenue and 26% year over year growth. Similar companies that have had slightly better growth but perhaps not as bright of a future (my opinion, not his) are valued at 8 times as much. 

**But it’s still just a meme stock right?**

I’m not judging GME or AMC. You can see from my comment history that I have been talking about GME for a really long time. But GME was a fling. BB is not a company that sells physical games that no one buys in 6,000 stores that no one goes to. And while I think AMC could have a monster summer if people feel safe going to the movies it still has crippling debt and a fundamentally changed market where direct to consumer releases are now a thing. 

BB got caught up with those companies because it’s viewed as wsb ‘tards making nostalgic picks. *Which proves my point that people don’t yet get what’s happening with BB.*

BB is not a fling. It’s not based on a squeeze. It’s just a really, really good company that will steadily rise and could have occasional massive pops (consider the 65% increase the day their amzn deal went public).

451,GME Guide and Common Misconceptions,"**Gamestop Guide:**
&nbsp;

I spent some time browsing subreddits and reading a lot of misinformation regarding GME and its future. I am by no means a financial expert and I guess I am obligated to say this isn’t financial advice. I am just an engineer with too much time on my hands and I hate to see people get taken advantage of. I don’t know that I am 100% right, but hopefully my post helps at least one person. 
&nbsp;

**1. Was there already a squeeze?**

By definition, yes, there was a squeeze. According to the S3 Partners estimates (graph linked below), the short interest on GME fell from approximately 69 million shares on 1/13/21 to 26.39 million shares on 2/3/21. This means that a portion of the price increase that we saw during that time was due to these short holders covering their positions. 
&nbsp;

**2. What if the short interest data is wrong/intentionally falsified?**

More short interest data will come out on 2/9/21, but it is important to know that it will only show the short interest as of the end of January. If you think S3 Partners and the other players are intentionally falsifying data then there isn’t anything that I am going to say that will change your mind.
&nbsp;

**3. Could there be another squeeze?**

There is the potential for another squeeze since the short interest is not zero.
&nbsp;

**4. What would it take to cause another squeeze?**

Since the short interest is significantly lower, it would require more pressure to cause the short players to exit their positions. Based on the short interest chart below, it appears that most of the short positions were closed right before 2/1/21. In order to get to this point where the short holders decided to buy, GME bulls had to buy approximately $90 billion in shares. (This was calculated by multiplying the volume traded on every day from 1/25/21 through 1/29/21 by an average daily price and adding them together. I chose 1/25/21 as the starting point since the price was similar to where it is now). Since the current short interest is significantly lower, it would require more squeezing for the short holders to feel enough pressure to cover their positions. 
&nbsp;

**Common Misconceptions:**
&nbsp;

**1. I lost 70+% on my GME shares. I might as well hold since it’s basically worthless.**

This is called the sunk cost fallacy and it occurs when we continue behavior because of previously invested resources. There are plenty of things that you can do with the money that you still have. There is an opportunity cost to holding the shares because you are missing out on other possible opportunities to make money from other investments.
&nbsp;

**2. I should hold for the long play since I am down.**

Unless you purchased GME for the long play originally and are comfortable with their fundamentals, this is probably not a great idea. GME is still significantly above its price before the short squeeze started (~$5 per share) and even with the new executive leadership, it is highly unlikely that it will reach the current value in the long term.
&nbsp;

**3. Everyone is saying hold and diamond hands and I don’t want to disappoint them.**

People who are still holding GME and hoping for another squeeze understand that if people exit their positions, there is no chance that they get another squeeze and they will likely lose more money. People telling you to hold or to buy have a vested interest in you not selling. It is also possible that they are trying to get more people to buy or hold so that they can exit their position when the price goes up. It is important to think for yourself and not just hold/buy/sell because someone tells you to. Do your own research and make your own decision. This is not a family or a team, this is the stock market and it is everyone for themselves.
&nbsp;

**4. I only lose if I sell.**

You lose liquid assets when you buy and you gain them when you sell. The idea that by not selling your positions you have not lost anything is just not true.
&nbsp;

**5. I should average down by buying more shares at a lower price.**

Buying more shares at a lower price reduces the average price paid for your shares, but it increases your exposure. If the stock continues to fall, you will lose more money.
&nbsp;

**6. We did it before; we can do it again.**

The short squeeze that happened was the perfect storm of media attention and coordinated buying. We saw that there may have been some shady business by certain brokers or media outlets that stopped the momentum of the squeeze. I agree that it does seem like the momentum was stopped by outside forces early, however, that does not mean that it can be done again. There is no longer much media attention on GME and the attention that it is getting is not always positive.
&nbsp;

**7. What about stimulus checks, won’t that cause another squeeze?**

I would not count on people putting their stimulus checks into GME stock. The media attention isn’t there anymore and a lot of people believe the run is over.
&nbsp;

**8. All the paper hands are out now so the stock will only go up.**

Everyone has a price that they will paper hands at. Some people are not at that price yet so they are holding still. Some people just bought in for the first time. The paper hands traders are definitely not gone.
&nbsp;

**9. By holding, I am sticking it to the man.**

While it feels good to think that you are taking down the establishment that you think has wronged you, it is important to understand that the short holders do not need your shares. You are not causing them extreme pain by holding. There are plenty of people trading and shares being sold that they could cover if they wanted to.
&nbsp;

**10. We are at (insert place) in the VW short squeeze graph.**

This information has been shared over and over to try and make people think that the squeeze is yet to come. The VW squeeze was very different to the GME squeeze and trying to act like they are the same is incredibly misleading.
&nbsp;

**11. Anyone posting negatively about GME is a bot from the government or the suits.**

I’m not saying there are no bots, but this is not a real argument. A lot of people who haven’t posted on WSB before were just lurkers. The amount of misinformation and garbage on the sub are causing people to start saying things to try and sort it out.
&nbsp;

For transparency, I believe that we have already seen the top of the GME squeeze and it will return to its old price so I have multiple GME put options. That being said, this post is not designed to make people sell or drop the price of GME, only to help people make their own decisions. As always, make your own informed decisions based on the amount of risk you can tolerate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le86o6/gme_guide_and_common_misconceptions/,"I’m holding until Tuesday. Even though I’m long, people should read both sides. I personally don’t think that shorts covered with enough volume to move the premixed much. Yesterday’s spike was likely some short covering, but I’m also pretty sure there were a lot of new shorts on the way down. I see that the interest rate to borrow shares is going down, but there’s still a lot of shares short. If GME does an offering at a high price, they can raise tons of cash and pay off their debts.Sir, this is the unemployment line.

Make informed decisions but don’t be a victim of “sunken fallacy” shills.I’m holding simply because I’ve been massively burned by the opportunity cost rationalizing in the past.

Hopefully it doesn’t get down voted out of existence.Just my opinion: We've definitely already seen the top ($400+) of GME. It's possible with 25m+ shares still shorted that we can see some spikes to $100, $150+ maybe, subsiding quickly afterwards. I don't think we will see $500 again.

Made money and I'm happy.Honestly I can't fault you because at the end of the day most people are paper handed bitches - and you entered really early before any of the madness and it's fair play. So congrats on your gains good sir.  


But I can't help but wonder how different the situation would be if people actually held instead of the dozens of people posting gains porn selling anywhere between 100-400. I still think GME is fucked and is going to squeeze, I just can't help but think how much faster and smoother it would happen if the hundreds of people who quietly sold in the first 3 days of the rally would've just held.This is the real big brain move.Awesome stuff. Sucks you couldn't make the 1year line for long term gain, but that's still a hell of a lot!i paper handed on monday before the dip. gains are gains",1612649492.0,139
453,THIS ISN'T ABOUT GME.,"*Disclaimer: THIS WAS POSTED BY* u/Foolmonso *BUT KEEPS GETTING DELETED. IT IS IN FACT ABOUT GME.*

*MODS COMRPOMISED. IF YOU THINK THIS IS SOLID DD, POST AS COMMENTS OR RESHARE, AS MODS KEEP DETETING.*

This analysis is not meant to influence, inspire, or inform you regarding your trades. This analysis was written purely as speculation and could be entirely incorrect. I found my own analysis interesting and wanted to share my unprofessional opinion. Furthermore, while these numbers are accurate as per their sources, they may not account for other factors that relate to the stock’s activity. I own shares of GME.*

**TLDR:** This is currently a war between funds. Your 1.41 shares don't move markets, you little fractional bitch. But if you sell at a loss right now, you're literally just giving them money like a fucking idiot.

Background: GME is owned almost exclusively by institutions and funds. [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders/)

The combined top 10 institutions + 10 funds own 88.93% of the shares. I don't know what the fuck 122.04% of Shares Held by Institutions means (may have the do with the made-up shares fuckery, but I'm not going to get into that). The point is, institutions and funds own almost everything, retail owns almost nothing.

GME was already heavily shorted by late 2020. Likely more than 80% of those shorts occurred at $4 or less.

Late 2020 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ: [https://imgur.com/a/6lH0nx5](https://imgur.com/a/6lH0nx5)

Note on shorts: When you short a stock, you have to pay interest **DAILY** on that stock at the **CURRENT PRICE**. If the stock's price decreases, you will likely make more money from the decrease than you will lose from the interest. When the price increases significantly, the daily interest may eat at all the potential profits you were hoping to make.

Early 2021 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ: [https://imgur.com/a/BlQDgI4](https://imgur.com/a/BlQDgI4)

As you can see above, in late January, the price of GME kept rising, and it likely became unprofitable/risky for these short sellers to continue holding their short position at these prices. They likely knew that the price was eventually going to go down, but it must have cost them a fortune on a daily basis to continue holding. This leads to some of them trying to cover their shorts, which led to the price rising even further, which led to others trying to cover their shorts, etc. Combined with retail mania, this is what created the ""squeeze.""

So the short interest goes from 102.08% to 88.58% and the price went from $35.50 to $347.51.

**Now, we know that the shorts were NOT covered.** I refer to this excellent post here as to how it's basically mathematically impossible for them to have actually covered: [https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis\_on\_why\_hedge\_funds\_didnt\_reposition\_last/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/)

**But there's another simple reason why the shorts weren't covered:**

**Who the fuck is going to leave their money with a fund that loses 53% of assets in a single fucking position? The ultra-wealthy whose assets these hedge funds manage would all immediately withdraw all their fucking money and sue for breach of fiduciary duty.**

Melvin may have told the media that they covered their shorts, but I guarantee they fucking called every one of their clients and told them they hadn't covered, and that they had a new plan. Get an injection of cash from Citadel and Point72 ($2.75 Billion) to pay the daily interest rates on their shorts, and run a FUD media campaign against these retail morons to sell and tell them that the squeeze is already over - while Melvin waits it out. ""The shorts have been covered, anyone left holding the bag is a fucking moron.""

So what's the current situation?

1) **Team A Hedge Funds:** These are the morons who shorted the stock at $4 and below and are currently bleeding. Some of them definitely covered and exited, but it's mathematically impossible for all of them to have covered. These are the REAL BAGHOLDERS. They literally lose money every day that they hold the short as long as the stock is over $4. They need the price to go down to reduce their daily bleed. They need to buy to stock back eventually to stop bleeding or reduce the price to $4 or below again.

2) **Team B Hedge Funds:** These are the sharks who sensed the blood in the water and shorted the stock as it was rocketing up. They hold shorts likely in the $150-$450 range. On paper, they have made a fucking fortune and are planning their next move. They love these currently ""low"" prices and want to buy back the stock and cash in their profit, but they can't do so too quickly without shooting the price up again and losing that profit margin. Because they shorted the stock, they are also bleeding. They will need to buy these stocks back eventually, before their profit goes to nothing (this could be a long long time).

3) **Team C: Institutional Holders and Fund Holders:** These guys basically hold all the shares that Team A and Team B Hedge Funds want. They're currently sitting on massive paper gains and want to squeeze Team A and Team B for every cent they have. They know Team A and Team B are bleeding, and that they must eventually buy back the stock (especially Team B since Team B wants to actually realize their profits). They're comfortable sitting on their profits, but they're also very comfortable bleeding these guys out knowing they have to buy back, and they can wipe out a competing fund in the process. They are also very happy if there is another squeeze because rather than sell 5 shares, they would love for the price to jump 500%, sell 1 share, keep 4, and continue bleeding Team A and B.

What's happening right now is that there is a war being waged between these three groups. Do not underestimate the people who work at hedge funds - they are extremely intelligent, extremely greedy, and extremely competitive. If a moron like me can dissect the situation, they all have certainly figured it out as well. What's happening right now is they are trying to find a market equilibrium price without giving away their positions. Team A wants to cover, but can't seem desperate or else the price will skyrocket. Team B wants to ""cover,"" but can't seem greedy without eating into their profits. And Team C wants to sell and realize their profits, but they can't all do it at once without tanking the price.

**And you, my paper handed fucking mongoloid friend, when you buy high and sell low, you literally throw your fucking losses into this pool for these three to fight over as they try to minimize their losses/maximize their profits.**

The short interest is still massively high and this story is just beginning. This is not the end, despite the FUD and the shilled pessimism in WSB. Will it hit $300 again? Maybe not. Will there be massive volatility as they duke it out and the opportunity to break even/profit? Yes.

You forgot one thing: Team D.

Cohen and his team of rich execs who do not give a fuck about Wall Street and their little civil war, will scoop up at least until the soft cap of 20% as stated in the 13D/A filing if not more. And that's just Cohen himself.

Alan Attal, Jim Grube, Kelli Durkin, Matt Francis, and Josh Krueger are all going to slam their massive dongs on the desk with multi-million dollar block buys that will be subtracted from the free float. 

We are going for Round 2.Good DD. Unfortunate that it'll probably be deleted shortly.Never left a show early in my life, why start now?

GME: Hedge fund insider reporting

Edit: this is not financial advice

As you can see, most of things going on with GME right now are just MSM being paid to lure normies into selling their positions. For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep shit going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.

First of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ? Why ? They want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium, WSB opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others.

Maybe people here didn't realize yet what they started, but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now. Second, big hedge funds are partnering up, but this is where comes the problem, imagine that you will try to rob a bank, what make you sure that the people that you partner with won't kill you to have less people to share the money with ? This is the current situation, this is the waiting, hedge funds, including the company that I work with are waiting for the money, and to see who they can trust.

In the end they will all backstab each other, this is the finance industry, you can't deny it. Because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri, guess who will be greedy to start another fucked up short ? Yes, the hedge funds, all over again, but is far easier to short at 750$, so is just a matter of who will short first. At work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it, that was what created this opportunity, but some people never learn.

This is why you should hold, I'm holding just for fun and to see this shit show, if one day I sell, I will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall, we are living the WW III of financial markets, now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new D day, meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side (long, but don't think that they care about you as a person) coming with the atomic bombs. One risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands (as you like to call them) may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack, rendering all this useless. Hold if you can, this is a game of patience, soon the direction will change, fucking huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner, or be bankrupt later.

Can't say much, but few funds already gave their CEOs and managers some quite fat bonuses, why ? This is the last song, last dance, they are looting the ship before it sinks. You have no reason to believe in me, I'm a random guy on the internet, but pay attention to the fucking events that are going on, and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks. If you put all of this together, you will see that the silence of operations (see the fucking low volume) means the silence before the storm. Wait to see the news of hedge fund managers hanging themselves

# DD

I was up sniffing glue at 3am on a sunday, when my last TWO brain cells rubbed together and had an epiphany 💡:

>DFV and **BURRY** are two absolute SAVAGES sticking their noses to the ground and 👃sniffing out **VALUE** 😤.  The only color they know is GREEN 🤑 THEY'RE DOING ALL THE LEG WORK FOR US BOYS.

That's when I found [https://fintel.io/i13f/scion-asset-management-llc/2020-09-30-0](https://fintel.io/i13f/scion-asset-management-llc/2020-09-30-0).

# Sure, the data is 3 months late by now.  But so are you on your rent payments so listen up.

Looking at **BURRY's** new holdings as of last quarter, he started a 🚨new position🚨 with **800,000 shares** of 💡**$LUMN**💡

What is 💡**$LUMN**💡 you ask?  It's a merger of two boomer ass telecoms CenturyLink and Level3.  It's got the most boring, bag-inducing, 5 year chart you've ever seen.  *Translation:  many bag-holding boomers will sell you covered calls for CHEAP* 🤑🤑🤑

I'm too stupid to read an earnings report, but here's a link to their latest one anyways: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000018926/360b3b44-7408-427c-98bb-c3978b239158.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000018926/360b3b44-7408-427c-98bb-c3978b239158.pdf)

Their **CORE** business is **INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE** delivered over their **FIBER** network (think: **FAST**).  I personally have fiber internet at home, even though it costs me double shifts at Wendy's. It's damn worth it.

ALTOGETHER, what this means is that 💡**$LUMN💡** is **cranking up operating efficiency** in an industry with RAZOR 🪒 thin margins 😬

Been looking at LUMN as well, there's something there for sure and it does have a cute divident to keep you interested at least for the time being. No major insider selling happening at all (no buying either though) and Seeking Alpha analysis are also bullish.

458,A guide to the Moon for new investors around here.,"This came from a conversation with a friend who's getting into the game a bit. I started trading right before Rona (Feb 23rd I picked my stocks, before J-Pow even unveiled the money machine!). I use strategies ranging from dedicated ETF portfolios to charting, and have found success in both (trading account around 130% this year). Here's some help based on what I've seen on here over the last year and the pretty significant reading I've done on investing theory-  


1. Start finding formulas that work. That’s a good way to learn a lot about different elements of a stock For example, a “buffet” style approach might have you look for a PB under 1 and a PE under 15, throw that in the screener (I like [https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&ft=4](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&ft=4)) Find filters that stand out to you and google them. Play around and you'll learn what's useful to you.  

2. Cross it with some trading strats. See which the best trades are based on those Then do some real DD (personally I check the financials a bit, Google news, Reddit search, and then whatever else makes sense at the time). ""Time in beats timing"" for sure, but there's no reason not to understand what RSI is. Having more tools to make decisions with is usually a good thing, just dont use them all every time.  

3. Expect to lose some trades, but it’s the price of the lesson. Losing money isn't that bad if you stick to the rule of only investing what you can afford to lose.  

4. Things that make sense sometimes don’t actually make sense because of some absolute shenanigans. It happens. Move on and laugh it off. There's forces at play that you don't even know exist.  

5. Don’t get cocky, it makes you sloppy. Develop a system and stick to it. Do you only invest in companies with positive PE ratios? Sure, if you have a reason for it why not. Change when the evidence suggests it should, but remember to keep learning new ways to evaluate and cross check moves.  

6. Largely disregard other people’s opinions, as they’re based on their situations. Someone who just bought a house will have a very different approach than someone in college, and someone with $2k has a different approach than someone with $20k, and $200k.  

7. YouTube is really helpful, so is Reddit, but keep in mind they all have personal motives and likely already own the stock they’re talking about so they are pumping it. Not that that’s a disqualifier, but it is a factor.  

8. Don’t be afraid to be wrong. It can be a lot of fun to experiment, and 'losing money' on a lesson learned can be more valuable than a monetary gain if it helps you make better choices in the future.  

9. Once you start having significant profits, it gets a lot easier to take losses. When you can lose $1k and still be positive by a healthy percent, it’s nbd. You'll get there, be patient and consistent. $1k seemed hard, and then $10k seemed hard. They say $100k is the hardest, but it’s really just discipline. It’s not like we’re throwing money at garbage, and we have thought out systems guiding our decisions (develop those)  

10. The coolest thing is how it compounds. It’s actually my favorite thing in the world. The snow falls on last weeks snow and gets bigger and bigger. Eventually, there's so much snow that it causes an ice age.  

11. Other people’s limits are not yours. Just cus they can’t do it doesn’t mean you can’t. This is all pretend, and literally anything is possible. Don’t get discouraged by bears, they just don’t see green. 'The crash' has been coming since April, but ""time in beats timing""  

12. Take breaks. You don’t need to make every dollar on the market, and it can deff get addicting/drive you to a breakdown since there’s so much to learn  

13. There’s a lot of noise. Tune it out and focus on your niche. You’ll find what you’re good at by experimenting, and the trend changes about every two weeks, so it’s pretty fun!  

14. Knowledge is a great investment. I haven’t bought a single piece of investment literature/course that I regretted (check out One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch or Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel)  

15. For every buyer there’s a seller. Someone has the exact opposite opinion of you on every move.  

16. When listening to old wisdom, consider that the infrastructure that makes today’s trading possible wasn’t even an idea yet (discount brokers, social media trading, internet, the lack of fees). The new rules enable a new approach.  

17. Whats best for you is different than whats best for me. You need to go through the learning process to grow as a trader and investor. And there is a big difference between trading and investing. Both are viable, as they both make money, and I find using them in tandem is most effective.  

18. Lock in your profits. If you can protect your initial investment, do it.  

19. ""Get money, buy income."" Take your trading wins and roll them into safer dividend moves to lock in your victories, or open new positions! (This is for trading, buy and hold your investments. Again, there is an important difference)  

20. Please learn what a share of a company actually is, why they go up and down, and what market price actually means. This will allow you to make much more informed decisions.

Obligatory Position: HRB $17 C 4/16",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le7w3f/a_guide_to_the_moon_for_new_investors_around_here/,"Good post OP.I have my autistic son pick out random stocks for me to invest in. So far up 82% this yearWhat does C 4/16 mean?This is good advice through and through. Not exactly traditional WSB material, but I’m not against it. 8 million people in this sub now. Most of them are probably so burned from GME that we will never see them again. But I think a new generation of traders is going to rise up and make this sub even more valuable. It doesn’t take long to learn enough to give a good DD. I think WSB will start to benefit from this blow up sooner than later.is this r/investing???im sorry do i eat the green or the red crayon?  I cant read to smooth brained for this.RemindMe!This is a good post but if I were you I'd go back and edit to add spacing between paragraphs so it's easier to read.Not investment advice.  Ignorant investment rambling at best. Not a broker.  Lover of index funds.  Very smooth brain.

Good stuff but I DISAGREE WITH OR WOULD REFINE:
I don't think any indifidual can out perform the market in the long-run on fundamental analysis. Even pro fund managers rarely out perform for more than a few years.  They usually understand some trend in the economy that is relevant for a short time and make a name for themselves.  You check backn2-3 uears later and their funds are under performing. Too many people with too much technology crunching that data. The way individuals can make money is by understanding the non-quantifiable characteristics of a company. And recognizing the market shenanigans and knowing how to take advantage of them.  Also, you are up against people with insiderninformation on these companies to which  retail investors will almost never get access.  Also, realize the big investors are buying chunks of companiesnthat allow them to influence the company. Double digit % of company stock. That is an ENTIRELY different game than owning .001%
6.  Pay attention to people with big megaphones.  Cramer or Mark Cuban for instance.  Even the WSB mob. If you agree with what they say it is usually too late to move on it once they say it.  They aren't always right.  If you disagree there is a very real likelihood of there being an opportunity.  Don't pay much attention to people who haven't been through a full business cycle.  Everyone is gaining right now and has been for years.  Some pretty bland index funds are returning 20%.
8. Losing doesn't mean this isn't for you.  Losing without learning means this isn't for you.  If you just got your ass handed to you on GME and you didn't learn anything from it close your account or move to index stock.  If you spent the last two weeks sucking up information like a sponge stick with it.
12. If you are going to take a break move into something secure or being managed by others.  I took a 3 month break while traveling and paid no attention to markets whatsoever.  When I returned and opened my portfolio two of the companies I held had basically gone bankrupt b/c financial fraud was uncovered.  They were down to a couple of pennies a share.
20. Get an MBA level textbook on corporate finance and/or managerial finance.  Use other resources like investopedia and wikipedia to explain it, but make sure you know all the concepts in that book.  You need to know and understand not just what the traders are doing, but also what the board and officers of a company are doing.  Or thinking.  That is a start, not the finish.

462,Robinhood's Collateral-Crunch Explanation Puzzles Wall Street,,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-06/robinhood-s-collateral-crunch-explanation-puzzles-wall-street,"A week after Robinhood Markets tried to clear the air by explaining why it slapped controversial limits on trading hot stocks, Wall Street’s risk professionals are still perplexed: How was the firm so ill-prepared for an obvious surge in collateral calls?

To the financial industry, anticipating collateral demands from hubs such as the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. is Brokerage 101. Major firms assign teams to study the DTCC’s methodology, estimate its requests and make sure ample cash is available. Everyone grumbles, sure, but they also know what happens when firms fall short: They scramble for a lifeline or shut down. Robinhood gathered billions from backers to keep it going.

“They obviously fell very, very short,” said David Weisberger, a market-structure consultant who built trading systems at Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley. He said he’s been puzzling over Robinhood, given what he called the “well known” requirements of clearinghouses. “This was a franchise-threatening event.”


The Silicon Valley startup left users fuming by temporarily restricting certain purchases at the height of January’s mania over GameStop Corp. and other “meme stocks” that were in the midst of skyrocketing. By the end of this week, as millions of customers were downloading its app to trade the fallen darlings and new ones, risk managers were still stuck on how Robinhood ended up in the predicament.

Reached for comment, a company spokesperson referred to a Thursday blog post by the president and chief operating officer of Robinhood Securities, Jim Swartwout.

“We have grown rapidly. And we have, at times, encountered challenges as we’ve scaled to meet this moment,” Swartwout wrote, describing how the firm’s growth and a surge in trading volume fueled collateral demands. “To say the overnight increases in volume Robinhood experienced last week were extraordinarily high would be a vast understatement. The surge was magnitudes higher than the norm.”

Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev has linked the trading restrictions to a roughly $3 billion collateral call that arrived early Jan. 28 from part of the DTCC, which Robinhood has said contributed to a 10-fold jump in weekly clearinghouse deposit requirements for equities. While Tenev has credited the DTCC for being reasonable and ultimately accepting $700 million, he has at times portrayed its formulas as opaque, noting they include a “discretionary” component.

ADVERTISEMENTSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT
“We don’t have the full details” of how the DTCC arrived at its initial demand, Tenev told Elon Musk last weekend in an interview broadcast on the social-conversation app Clubhouse. “It would obviously be ideal if there was a little bit more transparency so we could plan better around that.”

The rejoinder from industry executives: It’s pretty much just math.

‘Shame on Them’
In interviews, more than a half-dozen senior risk executives -- some from Wall Street’s largest firms -- reacted with bemusement to any assertions that the magnitude of the DTCC’s demands can’t be anticipated. They spoke on the condition they not be identified, in some cases because they interact with Robinhood.

They acknowledged there’s always complaining about the difficulty of pinpointing what clearinghouses will seek, and that things can go wrong. Some executives even recounted times when they got pressed for millions of additional cash on short notice. But overall, the group said that large, well-run firms don’t get surprised by requests that threaten to empty their pockets.

One brokerage executive said Robinhood should have ensured it had enough capital or stopped processing trades of volatile stocks. Charles Schwab Corp.’s TD Ameritrade, for example, began limiting bets on certain meme stocks the day before Robinhood did. Robinhood’s later restrictions were more severe, tapering off into the week that followed.

“Once every decade or so there are improbabilities that occur,” said Weisberger, who now runs cryptocurrency venture CoinRoutes. Self-clearing firms such as Robinhood need to know what potential demands they could face. “If they studied it and came up with an answer and it was wrong, well shame on the people who studied it,” he said. “If they didn’t study it, well then shame on them.”

Avoiding Surprises
The DTCC bases much of its deposit demands on elements including a clearing member’s concentration in volatile stocks, the volume of trades occurring, imbalances in buying and selling, and the firm’s financial condition. The more a brokerage is exposed to erratic shares, the more collateral it has to post. The less capital a brokerage has on hand, the more severe its surcharge may be.

The goal is to protect the broader financial system from trading defaults. To make collateral calls predictable, the DTCC says it provides “reporting and other tools to our clearing members to help them anticipate their margin requirements for a particular portfolio.”


The nightmare that clearinghouses are designed to avoid is that a brokerage loses so much money before a trade is completed that the firm can’t hold up its end of the transaction. Without a clearinghouse, one firm’s failure could cascade through the financial system. Unwinding just one trade means undoing all of the subsequent transactions if that share already was resold.

A broker-dealer’s collateral burden rises if it lends money to customers, and especially if they bet heavily on, say, stocks that have recently multiplied in value, as GameStop and others did last month. If prices suddenly crash -- which also happened -- it raises the risk that clients may not be able to repay their margin loans, leaving the brokerage to eat their losses. Some of the recent stock declines may be attributable to Robinhood liquidating clients’ positions to head off defaults on loans, according to Wall Street risk managers.

“Someone’s got to pay,” said Eric Budish, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. If you’re a brokerage, “you have capital to deal with that existential risk. I was surprised Robinhood didn’t have more capital for that scenario.”

Margin lending constituted about 20% of Robinhood’s $6.7 billion balance sheet in mid-2020. Robinhood tapped credit lines and raised about $3.4 billion from investors at the end of January.

Robinhood, founded in 2013, has been hiring Wall Streeters to help integrate the startup into the more traditional financial system. The firm appointed former Securities and Exchange Commission member Dan Gallagher, Fidelity Investments’ Norm Ashkenas and Wells Fargo & Co.’s Kelly Zigaitis to senior legal and compliance roles.

Robinhood’s Prescription
This week, Robinhood offered its own prescription to avoid future problems: The U.S. stock market should abandon its two-day settlement system and switch to a real-time process.

Moving the U.S. equity market to instantaneous settlement is a huge undertaking that would require years of work. Two components of trading would probably need to be digitized: The securities and the cash to pay for them. Digitally representing a security like a stock or bond isn’t difficult and a small-scale effort by Paxos Trust Co. to use blockchain to settle stock trades in near real-time received a green light from the SEC in 2019.


Digitizing U.S. dollars to pay for stocks is years off, if it ever happens. Another hurdle is all of the banks, brokerages, hedge funds and trading firms that buy and sell shares would need to update their systems to make the change. The transition would no-doubt be expensive.

Australia embarked on a plan to do just that in 2016 when Digital Asset Holdings announced a deal with ASX Inc. to remake the Australian Stock Exchange so settlement times could be cut from days to minutes. The project has been extended repeatedly and is currently two years behind schedule.

Meanwhile, Robinhood is fortunate to have access to venture capital to weather a rough patch, said Joanna Fields, founding principal at market structure consultancy Aplomb Strategies.

“There are firms that have controls, governance frameworks and processes, and that do not have the capability of getting that kind of capital infusion,” she said.

464,Bored of GME now. I've been following Aston Martin for the last 3 months and here some DD,"So been tracking James Bonds favorite car company for the last few months and all I can say is I'm glad I put money into it as its currently up 25%. 

Early last year the ass fell out of the company and  they almost went bankrupt. This is where the big man billionaire Lawrence Stroll entered and bought a massive stake in the company and used his contacts at Daimler Mercedes to help turn them around. 

Mercedes currently own a 5% stake in AM which will rise to 20% in the next few years. 

AM have a technical partnership with Mercedes to supply technology for engines, mechanical and electronic parts. 

They will have their own F1 team this year which is free advertising and promotion to a global audience. They are also supplying the safety cars this year instead of Mercedes. 

The head of AMG is now tasked with turning the company around. He is more than capable and with Mercedes getting a 20% stake they are not going to let it fail after all their investment. 

Stock is currently priced very low. Look at the graphs from 12 months ago before the new guys stepped in. If we get back to those levels then it would be more than a 400% increase from where we're at now. 

Their new car the DBX has been recieved very well and it caters to a new market of family friendly Aston rather than supercars. When they switch to EV they will have all Mercedes tech to play with. 

Get on board early and get into a position to get blasted on Martinis and buy some sick James Bond cars (headlight rocket launchers and ejector seats not included).

Link to Financial Times article with Tim Moers 
https://amp.ft.com/content/33613086-dbcb-4720-9805-49544200944d

Pasted from article
The brand will release 10 derivatives of existing cars within two years including two offshoots of its new DBX sport utility vehicle, as part of a planned model offensive, he told the Financial Times.

Mr Moers wants to refocus the company on engineering and bring more of its development in-house from suppliers, while working more closely with Mercedes-Benz to produce bespoke engines for the company.
Daimler, Mercedes’ parent company, owns a fifth of Aston’s shares and already supplies the British carmaker with some technology.
He also plans to boost Aston’s German engineering outfit, which is based at the country’s famous Nürburgring race circuit.
“Our technology partnership is there [in Germany], all the engineering suppliers are there, we should do something there to get the most efficiency out of the whole corporation,” he said.
Mr Moers was parachuted into the role from head of Mercedes’ AMG, the high performance subsidiary, over the summer by Aston’s chairman Lawrence Stroll, who led a rescue of the business earlier in the year.
Mr Stroll aims to restore the marque’s luxury credentials, and has installed a team he believes will help the business begin generating positive cash by 2023.
His arrival at the company this year also coincided with a large-scale clear-out of its executive team.
As well as a new chief executive and chairman, within the last year the company has replaced almost every top flight position, including the most senior executives in finance, sales, product planning, operations, engineering and the US, its largest international market.
The company has pushed back its first battery electric model, which will now be an Aston Martin instead of a Lagonda, the luxury sub-brand that is part of the group. The company has yet to reveal its new plans for the Lagonda nameplate.
“The electric car has to be an Aston Martin,” said Mr Moers, “because if you bring a new brand to life for electric vehicle cars, that’s wrong in my perspective.”

Most of us have positions in GME and AMC. But, most of us also are short attention spanned autists who need more than “*hold the line*” to keep our attention. Also, while we wait for the outcome of those tickers, we need to earn profits elsewhere. 

This is not /r/investing (nor is it /r/conspiracy by the way). 

If you wanna talk about GME or AMC, talk about them in the appropriate thread.I’ve looked at them too. The Financial Times ran a piece about them a few weeks ago and they took a little bounce off it, the main point of the article being that their lack of SUV was crippling them because that’s where demand was in their range. They’re now releasing (or have released one). If you want to keep going on your DD I recommend you find that short article because it talks about aspects you’ve not covered. 

Sentiment in the UK toward them is low though I must warn, purely because it burned people on the way down and so for quite a few UK investors there will be hesitation before getting on board and driving that demand. That said though, we undoubtedly like their cars and see them as a Jaguar+ which isn’t anything to be scoffed at.[removed]Interesting to think about.  I was doubtful Jaguar could turn their fortunes around but from what I see on the street they're pretty popular.  This could be a good buy.  Gonna dig into it more.Positions?

466,Just a thought...,"First, the formalities:
Not exactly new to investing, but still going through my paces. New to WSB, fresh retard here, bough into FOMO, holding because I have nothing much left to lose. 13 shares of GameStonks @130 avg. 11 of AMC at ""idc, like $13 or something""

Now. I see so many posts about ""you only see the message the mods want you to see"" and also do many ""sell and cut your losses"" posts.
But I've also seen some well thought out DD on GME, and I have massive confirmation bias for this, seeing as I'm banking on it to go up to ""win my money back"" (money I *could* lose, but really don't want to.)
I'm not selling, I don't have too much left to lose at this point, I'd rather stay in it on the chance of a second squeeze.

But back to the main idea here: I've seen a lot of ""sell, cut your losses, reinvest"" posts. I've seen a few notably good DD's on a probable second GME squeeze.
I'll two and two together, and that adds up quite nicely with that old advice about ""buy when others are selling"".
Point is, I got into this on mob mentality and hype. I learned my fuvking lesson about that, and now I'm sitting on >50% loss. But it doesn't seem quite right to get out of this on mob mentality, right after learning that lesson.

Two reason's I'm staying and holding then:
1. I have little left to lose on this, I believe that GME fundemental are changing enough so that selling now would be at a low, which is a terrible. ""How much worse can it get?"". I'm willing to gamble what I have left for the next week or three on the DD and possible second squeeze.
2. If everyone is here for thier own gain, and everyone really IS manipulating my noobiness for thier own profit, and those same people are the ones telling me to sell, then I'm not fucking selling. I'm not selling and getting left in the dust like this. If have to die on this hill, then good luck killing me, because I already have.

I have a gut feeling that this is the dark part of the tunnel, and I'm not quitting just because I can't see the light at the other end. This is the part of the movie where all seems lost, right before the final spectacular triumph. I'm gonna be there for the end.

To all the other holders out there:

If you can pull out with gains, or at least minimal losses, then evaluate your position and decide what is best for your situation, your mental health, and your long-term stability. Don't gamble your life on a meme, even if it's more than just a meme. Keep a stock as a souvenir or a ticket to the launch, if you do decide to leave. I think you would regret selling at a loss now, but there's the chance that it could be the right decision. Either way, pull through and commit to and live with that decision. Most importantly, take away your lessons. Write them down, or tell someone else exactly how you feel right now, and what you think you should remember from this.

If you're in this like me, balls deep and waiting for the squeeze, then I think our best move is to HOLD together. I don't think that selling for substanial losses is worth it at this point. Look at it. You sell now for -50% or more, decide to take a break, put it in an index or something and it grows a measly 8%? Meanwhile, you'll be glued to GME. Imagine if it moonshots. Your realized losses might feel bad, but it will be all that much worse if just a week or even a day later it moons, and you took your losses in vain. I think the game is worth it.

Either way, I would wait for us to get numbers on the 9th, that's when we will be the best informed to make our decisions. I foresee a lot of quality DD on that data we get, so watch out for that.
Hedges seem scared, that gives me a bit of heart too. What have they to be scared of if it's all truly over?


TL;DR: 
Ignore the haters, check your fundamentals, make a realistic assessment of your situation and your risk. Wait for the data on the 9th.
If minimal losses or gains, I suggest hold, as this is probably rock bottom, and we only go up from here. But make your own decision, based on your financial stability.
If balls deep and all in, I say HOLD, and hold strong through this week.
We're in the worst part of it right now, but no one ever said it would be easy. The best things never are.

This is not financial advice but I have tried to do some DD on this so please read to the end.

For those of you who might not know what Corsair is, they are a computer parts and peripherals company founded in 1994 that went public in September of 2020. If you have a desktop PC, keyboard, mouse, or are a streamer, chances are you have seen their logo. Corsair Gaming ($CRSR) reports earnings this coming week on Tuesday. In light of that, I have put together a few insights that some of you may find interesting.

Earnings. Tuesday February 9th

First, a look at the previous quarter’s earnings (Q3 2020)

**Q3 2020 Highlights**

\- Net revenue was $457.1 million, an **increase of 60.7%** year over year

\- Gamer and creator peripherals net revenue was $161.6 million, an **increase of 128.8%** year over year

\- Gross profit was $129.9 million, an **increase of 112.4%** year over year

\- Gross margin was 28%, an **increase of 680 bps** (that’s 6.8%)

\- Gamer and creator peripherals segment gross profit was $60 million, an **increase of 200.8%** year over year

\- Gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $67.9 million, an increase of 68.7% year over year

\- Operating income was $49.7 million, an **increase of 353.6%** year-over-year

\- Adjusted operating income was $61.4 million, an **increase of 193.7%** year-over-year

\- Net income was $36.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.02 per diluted share

\- **Adjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.**

**-** Adjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, an **increase of 184.9%** year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.9%, an **improvement of 610 bps** year-over-year

**Q3 Earnings Call Highlights (quotes from the call)**

\- “This last quarter was one with very strong demand, with many major retailers running out of stock of our gear. Our stock situation has gotten better but only a small part of Q3 revenue came from restocking shelves, **with most gear selling as soon as they hit the shelves**.”

\- “We also recently launched two new microphones under our Elgato brand, Wave 1 and Wave 3, **which were sold out within the first few days of launch**.”

&#x200B;

**Catalysts for Growth**

According to data released by the International Data Corporation (IDC),

\- Global gaming PC shipments are expected to jump by 25% by 2024, while **global shipments of gaming laptops, desktop PCs, and monitors jumped 16.2% year over year in 2020 with December 2020 seeing the highest sales of PC components and peripherals on record**.

**-** IDC predicts 2021 to witness a real surge in gaming PCs as new graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD and Intel are expected to drive prices down and performance up.

**- Global gaming PC sales revenue has jumped 60% in the past 5 years.** In 2015 the global gaming PC market reached $24.6 billion in revenue, which has increased to $39.2 billion in 2020. High end gaming computers represent the largest revenue stream in 2020 at $18.5 billion or 47% of combined profits in 2020

\- Not only will Corsair be able to capitalize on a gaming PC super cycle upgrade with new GPUs but on October 22, 2020, Corsair announced the launch of their first officially licensed headset for Microsoft Xbox. Corsair will also be able to capitalize on the Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox console super cycle using their headsets and Scuf Gaming controllers for consoles. Corsair currently holds patents on several console controllers, Microsoft has licensed these patents to create the Xbox Elite Controller.

\- According to Corsair

\- There were 2.6 billion gamers (across all platforms) as of 2019

\- 11% of leisure time in the US is spent on gaming

\- 12 billion hours of gaming content was streamed in 2019

\- 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming content on streaming platforms

\- Corsair will be able to capture this enormous rise in streaming using their Elgato line of products which enhance the ability of content creators to stream.

&#x200B;

**Market Share**

\- Pulled from Corsairs S-1 filing, they currently command over **18% of the US market share in gaming peripherals and nearly 42% of the gaming PC components market share**. This will allow them to capture a substantial portion of revenues from the global gaming peripherals market size which is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate **(CAGR) of 10.4**% from 2020 to 2025 according to grand view research.

  

**Ranking of Corsair’s Total US Market Share by Product:**

**-** Keyboards: 2nd

\- Mice: 3rd

\- Headsets: 4th

\- Streaming Peripherals: 2nd

\- Performance Controllers: 2nd 

\- Memory: 1st 

\- Cases: 1st 

\- Power Supply Units: 1st 

\- Cooling Solutions: 1st 

&#x200B;

**-** Releases of gaming content with ever-higher graphical requirements will drive consumers to upgrade their components and subsequently their peripherals as well.

\- **Corsair gaming is an ecosystem of products with a strong and recognizable brand which creates extreme brand loyalty amongst its customers.** This is more of a personal opinion but through my own experience and observation, it seems that when a customer goes to upgrade 1 component from Corsair, several hundred dollars later they come out the other side purchasing a number of internal PC components and have upgraded all of their peripherals (keyboard and mouse), but this is anecdotal.

&#x200B;

**Q4 Earnings & Beyond** (released before the bell on Tuesday February 9th).

These are predictions and can obviously be taken with a grain of salt but I hope you can understand my rationale

\- I believe we will see a huge beat on Tuesday’s earnings release. This will be led by the compounding effects of the pandemic stay at home orders along-side an extremely strong holiday season. According to the site: Super Data, sales of digital games experienced a record number at $12 billion in December alone. This was the highest monthly revenue on record with PC games taking the lion’s share of this with a year over year revenue jump of 40% thanks to Cyberpunk 2077. This extremely high demand for PC games will drive the upgrading cycle and demand for Corsairs PC components and their peripherals.

\- I also believe that Corsair is a long term hold with substantial growth potential as the adoption of gaming grows.

&#x200B;

**Competitor Comparison**

**-** Corsair is frequently compared to Logitech.

\- Logitech currently has a market cap of $18.63 billion, Corsair has a market cap of $4.15 billion.

\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $2.9 billion, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $1.65 billion.

\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $300 million, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $192 million.

\- Logitech currently has 169 million shares outstanding with a float of 162 million share float (6% is shorted), Corsair currently has 92 million shares outstanding with a 25 million share float (24% is shorted)

**I believe Corsair is severely undervalued**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le74iq/corsair_crsr_dd/,"Ive been holding 5/21 $45 calls since nov. they are almost back to my buy price. Agree they are undervalued, and I def wish I’d double up when those were even cheaperTo those comparing $LOGI to $CRSR, $LOGI had a 30% run prior to earnings and now it hit an all-time high once again.I see Corsair I upvoteCorsair is solid. You may only know if you are involved in the PC building space and that space in general is exploding. Tons of console converts. 

They may have some what over priced products but they are very popular. Plus they now own Origin, Elgato and Scuff. I don’t even need to look at your DD. I already know.Sir, this is a slot machine. 

I agree, it’s a good investment stock. But, do you foresee enough volatility and volume for it to moon off of shorts or leaps, is or this gonna be a theta fucker?

Edit: For the record, I upvoted your DD. I just wanted clarification.As a pc gamer, I am totally biased and I love this stock.While I have a personal dislike of Corsair as a company after some stability issues that they were lazy to address, the supply constraints of the Xbox and PS5, combined with the ever rising popularly of live-streaming put Corsair in a fantastic long position.I like Corasair but just missing that extra sparkle to hit that next level, their stuff is solid though.  They need to buy NZXT and power mesh those NZXT aesthetics with Corsair quality.  I mean NZXT makes some damn sexy MoBos, put Corsair on top of that and I would leave MSI in a heartbeat.  Logitech saw that they needed some freshness and gobbled up some good companies.  Sometimes your internal talent pool can only take you so far.

Thanks for the DD though, worth looking into.  I agree that volatility will be at best very short if at all though.

Edit: spellingsGood DD. With the high short interest, good fundamentals, and greater “meme potential” I’m also hoping in the chance that it squeezes coupled with good ER. With my luck it’ll tank though, like my FB /tech earning play calls earlier (except the one that I don’t, GOOG, moons)I wish corsair AIB GPUs for Nvidia and AMD like Asus and MSI do",1612646412.0,347

477,"If You Don’t Know Whether The GME Squeeze Has Squoze, You’re Right","(Disclaimer - this was a reply I posted in a previous thread - you may have already Reddit. Also not a financial advisor do your own DD)
_____________________

To those who think the squeeze has squoze and those who have not. You’re both right 

To state the obvious, last week Hedge funds were caught completely off guard and there was a massive massive gamma squeeze / short seller meltdown which crescendoed Thursday morning. 

Many are looking to the next short report to determine how squozen we truly are. Do not place too much faith in the 2/9 short report. It won’t tell you much imo. 

Why? We sat at 100% short interest for 6 months+ with no squeeze. Squeezes require catalysts and multiple catalysts are in play at the moment. 

So how do you determine if HF and others are still massively short? 

One Answer: check your own broker. Can you short the stock? Are there shares available? If cost to borrow is over 15% and/or there are no shares available - it’s a crowded short no matter what the report says. You can likely check on the weekends too. 

The current rate on IBKR is 3.7% and there are 800k shares available to borrow. This rate is lower than the previous average of ~20%. Shares available to borrow  have been anywhere from 0 to 1 million.  So IBKR to me indicates some potential covering and slightly less squeeze potential. 

But also keep in mind, if the short report says 44% of the float is short - this is still insanely high and about 2x what I would consider a crowded idea (20% is crowded imo). So don’t be fooled into thinking the covering is over even if short interest dips to lower levels. 

To me it feels like Old Wall wants the price down. Why? I’m not sure exactly. But even the dreamers on Twitter who have spent the past year pumping Tesla think GME is a bubble. Lol. People thought the Tesla bubble popped last year in Feb when it peaked at $968.99 (pre split, so actually $190 versus $850 today.  Again. People thought the Tesla bubble popped at $190.)

As for GME, Hedgeye had a $100pt. Citron covered and is scared to short. Lots of other hedgies will probabaly never pile in short to this name lest they have to explain to investors why they were burned twice. 

I don’t think RC bought at $16, risked locking up his money for a long time, simply to EaRN 5 pECEnT PeR YEar. 

Insiders haven’t sold except for one. Company hasn’t sold and is instead pumping the news flow up with Amazon hires. DFV was in at $4. He could have sold at $60 and have still been a legend.

Dr. Burry is currently - as recently as last night - been tweeting about Gamma squeezes. 

So let’s not pretend like any of us know exactly what’s going on. But uncertainty creates opportunity. 

If everyone knew we were going to squeeze again, the price would be much much higher and you wouldn’t be able to buy at these levels. 

This is still a highly volatile situation. In my opinion, the risks are extremely high both ways but I would be terrified to be short right now. 

Mainstream media’s mis-reporting of GMEs prospects, literal trading suppression by brokerages, threats of investigations, etc - if you just think about it - can only be doing one thing which is holding the price down. 

So to the extent GME is being manipulated at all, it’s very much to the downside imho. 

While it’s frustrating to be misunderstood by big media, big Twitter - whatever. In the end, it literally will not matter. 

The ball spiking that CNBC did to Elon and TSLA while they were down - may have felt good at the time to them. But boy did it cost them in the long run. 

And it’s not like CNBC made a mistake and then changed course overnight. They tried to FUD Tesla into oblivion through the entirety of 2020 while the price ripped in their face relentlessly. And then ripped some more. And some more. Sound familiar?

This suppression can be reversed explosively with:

More Insider Buying
New Insider Buying
Strategic Partnerships
Earnings Beat
More short covering 
Possible Gamma Squeeze Round 2 (I think unlikely)
RC memes


Speaking of Gamma squeezes - and I would love some fact checking on this - but I think one of the reasons we cannot repeat is because deep OOTM ($800) calls now exist. MM can hedge with those rather than only through purchasing shares which they had to do when every call written was a Delta 1, thus very in the money. 

But finally - an investment thesis that relies on a squeeze is not much of a thesis. It’s really a combination of A) the market realizing fundamental value is much higher all at once .... which causes B) forced short covering with limited exit paths. 

VW squeezed for purely non fundamental reasons and it came back down to earth.  I firmly believe GME “squeezed” for fundamental reasons which could make this rally far more sustainable. Again, see Tesla. 

Just take a look at RC, e commerce valuations, and the types of $$ GME is doing. There’s value here. 

Other than all that. I have no opinion on the matter. Excuse incoherent rambling and any typos.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le726v/if_you_dont_know_whether_the_gme_squeeze_has/,"youre assuming they covered, id argue they tried to get as many shares to short again but at a new price target... now i heard a compelling argument that si could be the same thus implying synthetic longs... i think the interest is sky high(but its a guess) bc of how volatile this is... id also argue they couldnt get their hands on enough shares for them to adequately go after it... but this would be a brilliant strategy(and not sure bout other legalities).  now if another HF cones to play taking on an opposite position... they could try to keep the stock flat long enough for this strategy to fail(which i DO believe is happening) and it wouldnt surprise me if cohen and others tried to buy more...even at tops....this game is fin fun to watch and im long....Why did they spend so much money promoting silver, infiltrating reddit and changing their shorting formulas as well as telling people to sell? As well as short ladder attacks? All the data i see, people are holding and buying. Wjy would anyone care so much about you holding shares if the squeeze was squozen? Honestly just doesn't make sense to waste so much money ""caring"" about people holding stocks especially right after mark cuban said to hold and buy. Don't they have other stocks they could just move on to if this was really true?For me the 2 most important factors for GME potentially going up is dependent on 2 factors:

1. Shorts with big gains cashing out so 200$+ buy in shorts not wanting to wait for more gains and taking the 100$+ per share gain thus reducing the average price of the shorts.

1. The amount of new shorts at current price, if we see large amount of shorts at this price and the price refuses to go down the chance of GME going up increases a lot. So if we see continued shorting in 50-70 range the pressure on the stock to go up will increase significantly since it will compound with 1. in shifting shorts rapidly into a worse position.

I am currently not really interested in holding a position in GME but there is some reason to hold depending on what you feel like is going on but I don't think it will have the same pressure as before.All 115 stocks transferred from robinhood to fidelity are on Margin if that helps (meaning their shorted) calling now to move them to cashsqueez has had and not happened 🧐How are they hedging with 800 calls? There’s a wide gap from 130 which is believed to be the approximate new short break even and 800One difference between the Volkswagen short squeeze and the one people.want to happen to GME- SURPRISE.
There is no element of surprise in this situation. Porsche blindsided everyone with their announcement of acquisition of over 80% of shares I believe.
The GME shorts saw this coming and cut the power cord (robincrook and others removing the buy option).
At this point, it will likely take a lot of capital to initiate another spike. Meaning long whales vs short whales.I don't think the HF were caught off guard last week, they just realistically had nowhere to go without screwing themselves over in the process.Congratulations, or sorry to hear that.But SI isn’t all that matters. I’d bet all my money the SI is still the same, just at much higher positions now. So to trigger the squeeze you’d have to run up the price way, way, way up to 300/350/400 to even start putting pressure on them. 

Which won’t happen because retail doesn’t have nearly as much power as they think they do. 

TL;DR - focusing solely on SI is misleading and missing the crux of the issue. Not all shorts are made equal.",1612646207.0,160

479,The Interstellar Yoyo ⭐🪀⭐,"Hallo all. I've been watching what's going on with great interest. There have been many things I can't explain. So I sat down and did a Think. But I know we're all just simple apes here, so why don't I tell you a bedtime story instead?

**Story Time**

Imagine there's a GME market participant, looking for a quick buck, with not the best grip on morality. I know that's a big stretch, but just go with me. We'll call him 'Snidely'.

Snidely is big into shorts, where you borrow a stock from someone, sell it immediately, and have to buy it from someone else later. But normal shorting isn't quite exciting enough for him. He wants to go naked. A naked short is when you skip that whole 'borrow' step at the beginning.

So Snidely notices that, due to [17 CFR 242.203 b 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.203#b_3), he can issue a short without actually having to go through the annoyance of borrowing it, and has 13 ""settlement"" (""business"") days to actually find someone willing to lend him that stock. This is great news for Snidely! It means that he can sell a stock he made up on the spot, then look for ideal times in the next 2-3 weeks to find someone he can borrow from to un-make it. So long as the stock price even temporarily falls below his sale price sometime in the timeframe, he can make money by borrowing at that point. He just found a freakin' cheat code for cash!

And so Snidely issues the naked short sell, and sells off his newly minted ""stock"". He finds ample buyers, and has no problems with that bit. Shucks, he can actually sell a little under market level if he needs to - After all, he can always just print more stock. Hahaha, Snidely goes brrrrr.

But then the unthinkable happens. Some idiots actually buy the stock, and the price stays higher than he bought for the entire 13 settlement day period. FUCK. Now he HAS to borrow, or he loses access to his wonderful money printer, as per [17 CFR 242.203 b 3 iv](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.203#b_3_iv).

So he does. And loses some money. It sucks. Oh, and the stock price went up, because he had to buy so much. And then some moronic internet forum notices him doing this, and starts to buy too. Fuck. FUCK. If this idiots actually manage to peg the stock at this level, he'll be out of a job. He might actually have to buy the cheap caviar, or whatever it is the poors eat.

So Snidely looks in his bag of tricks... and only sees one trick. And so he begins naked short selling stocks that he knows he doesn't have yet. He does it a little below market rate, because that helps cool the stock off, which helps him. He has 13 whole days for the stock price to drop, after all. He uses the money from the new shares to start borrowing shares to cover his old ones. Weirdly, the liquidity isn't as low as the numbers would suggest, and he's able to borrow enough to cover his position fairly easily.

Plot twist - Snidely isn't the only Snidely. Snidely is legion. And as each Snidely pursues this plan, the stock price drops, since they all feel comfortable selling a little below market. And while they're covering, they *buy up each other's made up stocks*.

They haven't fixed the problem. They've just moved it 13 settlement days down the road. And made it bigger.

And once one of them starts buying to cover their new position, the rest will panic and join in, and the stock will soar again.

**Evidence**

Sooo... if this story is somewhat true, what events should we have already seen?

* We should expect to see a slightly less than 13 settlement day period between stock increases, because if Snidely's wait too long they lose access to the ability to naked short. Given that GME first jumped in price on [Jan 12th](http://www.google.com/search?q=gme), then again on the 26th, that gives an 11 day period - Exactly in line with what we expect.
* We should expect to see anger and push back from wall street in that same slightly-less-than-13-settlement-day period, fading rapidly as they choose to 'cover' their positions by selling more fake shares. This is more or less exactly what we saw on this subreddit.
* Shorts should be extremely eager to tell us the closed out their positions, because they also opened new positions and NEED the stock to go back down before their time limit runs out. Yup, we sure as fuck saw that.
* We should have seen Failure-to-deliver figures high, and growing. [Yup, that's exactly what we see in GME.](https://wherearetheshares.com/)
* We should expect to see a sky-high official short rate that *isn't* reflected in third party data. We already see that in the existing data.
* We should see the SEC being uninterested in the shorts/Snidely, because no actual laws were broken by this behavior. And wow would ""uninterested in the shorts"" be a motherfucking understatement for what the SEC is up to.

**Anti-Evidence**

Some stuff doesn't fit neatly into this theory, and needs other explanations or caveats.

* Robinhood and other brokers shutting off buying is not directly explained by this. Buuuut I feel like the current explanations of increased capital requirements due to Snidely-induced volatility mostly does a fine job of explaining this.
* We shouldn't see firms resorting to illegal tactics like ladder attacks, since they can accomplish their goals legally. But every instances of a 'ladder' attack we've seen is better explained by a Snidely bulk selling naked shorts.
* The push for the fake 'Silver squeeze' is not explained by this. I think that was just an opportunistic play, rather than an actual distraction attempt.

**Predictions**

* An actual short squeeze will never happen. The Snidely's can just print more naked shorts whenever they need them.
* We should see Failure-to-deliver figures jump when the next data dump occurs. [Watch here.](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)
* We should see a growing official short interest that isn't reflected in third party figures.
* *We should expect to see a massive rise in the stock price about 11-13 settlement days after the last large stock rise. Which puts the date for expected movement around Feb 10-12*

**Conclusions**

Sorry friends, this isn't a VW-style short squeeze, infinite squeeze, or rocket to the moon. It's a fucking interstellar yoyo that's going to keep shooting up higher and higher in nearly-13 day intervals until *something* breaks.

Stock owners aren't the bag holders. The Snidely's are.

**Dirkson, what should I doo^o^o^o ?**

Oh, hell if I know. I'm not a lawyer, your lawyer, a stock dude, CPA, CFA, CFP, or whatever. I'm just some idiot who thought it was a good idea to buy two shares at $300. I wasn't even one of you before the Vast Migration, and I still don't talk right.

None of this is legal or financial advice, I'm just discussing what I think is happening. Think for your own damn self!

Snidley/Dr Strange is facing a world savaging beast (WSB) but they keep resetting the clock (reselling naked shorts). This locks the world destroying beast (WSB) in a stalemate until WSB cave in (sell)

No one will want to invest with them again after that.Nice write up dude! I have no idea what’s going to happen either but there are large costs associated with naked shorting, mainly the interest involved. So hypothetically they are just bleeding money on these positions and opening up new ones isn’t helping. A margin call or if a stock holders meeting were to occur would trigger a large buy back akin to a short squeeze.",1612645669.0,463

#Stay Fucking Strong
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🙌🦍💪🦍💪🦍💪

If you were faced 70 BILLION in the hole, losing to self proclaimed retards, autists, and degenerate gamblers you’d be doing EVERYTHING in your power to not lose.

I read a post that said this is financial warfare, we’re in WWIII right fucking now. It’s the 99% vs the 1%. It wasn’t a joke. We broke the market last Thursday and they want to keep us down. 


It will not be a big swoop, currently it’s psychological warfare - want confirmation look at any social media or main stream media. They’re either silent or telling you you’re an idiot. The hedge funds want you to sell, they want you to feel like an actual retard. Look at the Melvin citadel tropic thunder meme, look at the “ladder attack” meme. Fuck look at all the shit head memes that are not making any of us feel good. 

#hold the fucking line because this IS bigger than all of us. Realise your place in history and take part in showing Wall Street that retail investors can say what the price is at. 

These fucks are mad that you are not doing what they say and what they want to you to do. The free market was established to let the people (common people) invest in what they want & make bank collectively. 

With every decision you make comes a form of belief, which is a truth in this world. You believe in love, laughter, family yet it can’t defined by any one word sentence or photograph. The shorts -are- still higher than the float, and what the fuck are people missing here?? 
WE LIKE THE STOCK BUY THE STOCK STOCK GOES UP HOLD THE STOCK UNTIL WE FUCKING WIN. You’ll know when we’ve won. 

I’m fucking disgusted by what this sub has become. Infiltrated by bots, shills, provocateurs. The old crowd might never come back unless we grow a pair of balls stop wallowing in self pity and fight together like the wallstreetbets we are. 

Please think for yourself. Do not yolo your life savings in hopes it will rocket to the moon, do not put yourself at risk of losing the little stability you’re holding onto right now in hopes this will be your light in the glory hole tunnel. 

But if you can... Do you want to stick it to the people who said “hell is coming” and then made BILLIONS of dollars off the little people??? Do you want to fight for the people who worked 20 years day and night to grow their restaurant, ma and pa retail stores who are locally owned??? Fucking fight for all of those people. The situation seems absolutely ludicrous and ridiculous that THIS RIGHT HERE is our fight, but do not get confused or allow the media to gaslight you. We DID break the market, we did make every single hedge fund shit their pants but this fight isn’t fucking over. 

You need to dig deep as this is emotional, hope is emotional, making a change and defeating a bully is hard as fuck. LOOK AT EPSTEIN. Guilty as mother fucking sin. We don’t even have a mother fucking answer about that one. 


You think the people in charge are just going to give up? That they won’t pull every single dirty, manipulative, callous, petty, illegal trick in the book to make sure a bunch of autists and retards lose it all??? Fucking wake up and ask yourself where you want to be next week, a year from now. Do you want to look back 20 years and feel like you got fucked in the ass?? Fuck no. It’s that simple. Hold the fucking line and make sure everyone else does the same (within reason!!) or we deserve the royal ass fucking these elites give you every single day, stroking it to the loses you took in 08. 

This is not financial advise. I’m not a financial advisor and fuck you to everyone trying to destroy mother fucking retail AGAIN. Seriously when the fuck is it going to be enough for you greedy ass fucks?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le6v37/my_thoughts_on_the_current_gme_situation_i_invite/,"> hold the fucking line because this IS bigger than all of us. Realise your place in history and take part in showing Wall Street that retail investors can say what the price is at.

It's very simple math.  75 million shares.  Anyone holding long is either fine with a rise in profit, or will sell to take profits. I don't know if most institutional investors have a ""sell"" threshold for their stocks, or if they're in long and they sell when something changes.  That's what mark Cuban said he did, he does his analysis and holds until they changes, not necessarily the price action.  Who knows if that is common.

Who has an interest in the stock going down? Anyone who is short of where it is.  Every hedge has a basket of stocks and they have a range those stocks they're short on need to be in to remain profitable.  So, there is a price, X, where they can no longer afford to cover their short position, whether it is 20% of the shares or 100% of the shares, and this means their bets are overall in the red.

If 100 million ppl with cellphone stock apps all wanted a share of GME for X+1 (1 dollar over the Hedge fund's profit threshold) then GME would rise to that level and because 25 million ppl would still be trying to buy at that level, it would oscillate around X+1 +/- something. 

Are we there yet? No, but that is because there are millions being spent to get people to look the other way or to think that the ""smart"" thing to do is buy low sell high.

Buy high, sell higher. That's how common people can use the stock market as a store of value.

Value is completely in the mind, don't let anyone tell you anything has a ""natural"" value, all that is tracking is the psychology of everyone else.  You need to set your own price for yourself and your holdings, not follow the crowd.  That's the ultimate lesson they don't want people realizing, you set your own price: you either get it or you get nothing, but this is a powerful stance.  I'd rather take nothing than less than I am worth.  It's not about stocks, it's about the ""prisoner's dilemma"" world they've built for us where co-operation is 'stupid.'

Can you imagine a family with children or elderly people running on game theory/prisoner's dilemma logic? ""Should we eat grandma? What maximizes our caloric return...""

It's how unions work.  If they can monopolize the work, they can set the price.  If they can't, then there's always some paper handed bitch willing to sell/work for peanuts.  Who does best of the ""common people"" who are not elites in law, plumbers, etc. etc.  Mostly ppl in unions, because they are allowed to picket and set the price for their labor.  If you are majority shareholder, you can simulate that, set the price.

Shareholders Union! Never sell for less than you are worth!I'm genuinely wondering if it's not going to be one BIG pop, but rather a bunch of little pops.This discussion contains the most words my shitty brain has ever attempted to read.

Okay so, hear me out...

O.G. Shareholder Hold All 100 shares and refuses to sell (there is zero market liquidity, zero supply to even one buyer = infinite demand to supply ratio; share price skyrockets)

Short Seller borrows 50 shares to sell to the market (liquidity emerges, supply and demand becomes a rational ratio, prices stabilize)

O.G. Shareholder buys 'new' shares directly from the market (all 50, s/he is willing to pay the price to get every share out of the market's hands).

Original shares = 100

Borrowed shares = 50

O.G. Shareholder = 150 Shares

Then O.G. shareholder calls the 50 borrowed shares back... and refuses to sell.

Is this something that can happen? And if so, what is the absolute cheapest stock on the market (market-cap-wise, I mean) that allows options trading?

Asking for a friend.
_______________________

*edit: Seems like if a company is 100% owned by a single investor it is no longer a publicly owned company, and would get delisted. This still raises two questions:

1) What happens if there are already short sold shares out there floating and someone just buys up enough shares to own 100% of the company. Do the shares then get called back in order to delist the company? Does the company simply get delisted with one individual owning more shares than originally existed?

B) How many people would have to own 100%, collectively, in order for this to occur ""organically"" within the market (at which point the company does NOT get delisted)? Obviously y'all are gonna be like 'cOlLuSiOn iS iLlEgAl"" but yeah like we haven't seen plenty of collusion and no one got sent to jail for it. One of y'all said it best on another thread: SEC fines are just budgeted in.

Not financial advice.Won't work.

In order to be listed on an exchange you require having a set number of stocks already outstanding (i think NYSE is 1 million or so).

If you hold all the shares, you can't be listed, as such if you are unlisted someone can't short you.

&#x200B;

If a single person owns all available public shares they become a defacto primary owner of the business, and the stock is delisted until they meet requirements again.

&#x200B;

They could buy up like 90% and effectively initiate a squeeze. This is basically what happened to VW when Porsche became a 90% stake holder and basically took over the company minus some outstanding shares and the shorts.Well, if someone bought all the shares in existence of a particular company then they'd corner the market. There are laws against that so you might end up in jail before any of that borrowing/lending stuff.

488,A case for going long on $LUV (Southwest Airlines),"Heyo WSB

Forgive the degenerate writing, I just like this stock and want others to know about it. 

**What is Southwest Airlines?** 

**Southwest Airlines Co.** is a major American airline headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and is the world's largest low-cost carrier.  The airline was established on March 15, 1967, by Herb Kelleher as **Air Southwest** Co. and adopted its current name, Southwest Airlines Co., in 1971, when it began operating as an intrastate airline wholly within the state of Texas, first flying between Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.

Southwest operates a leisure-focused low-cost carrier, **which is well-positioned for a leisure-led post-pandemic recovery in aviation**.  Southwest has generally been able to achieve low-cost carrier unit expenses and passenger yields close to legacy carrier levels.  **Southwest’s focus on providing low fares could allow it to make inroads with business travel in the current recessionary environment.**

**Why get in now?**

1.  **CFRA Maintains Buy Opinion on Shares of Southwest Airlines Co.**

* ""We lift our target to $53 (from $48), 20x our 2022 EPS estimate (raised to $2.79 from $2.66; 2021 unchanged)."" 
* Q4 adjusted EPS of -$1.29 vs. $0.98 beat consensus by $0.39. 
* Revenue fell 65% Y/Y in Q4 as the pandemic continued to depress air travel demand. **Yet, despite the quarter’s major resurgence of Covid-19, which led to new travel restrictions and business closures, LUV’s revenue grew 12% vs. Q3.** Such strong sequential revenue growth in this harsh environment suggests that there is significant pent up air travel demand. We think this demand will start to be unleashed this Spring as vaccines become widely distributed, allowing LUV to soundly beat revenue and EPS estimates for 2021. 
* Additionally, despite the unprecedented demand weakness, **LUV has maintained a strong balance sheet with negative net debt throughout the pandemic.** 
* Manageable debt, strong customer loyalty, and efficient operations will lead LUV to be the first major airline to recover profitability, in our view, which we expect midway thru Q2. 

[ For the first quarter 2021, analysts estimate LUV will earn -$1.90 non-GAAP per share, a decrease of 1,168.00&#37; over the prior year first quarter non-GAAP results. ](https://preview.redd.it/nfs70jt76xf61.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=72de9a23e3ff7d48c85c818d94c6272ec13ff2ab)

2.  Southwest has used the pandemic as an expansion opportunity, adding 14 new destinations since March 2020.   Overall, the 14 new destinations added or announced by Southwest since March 2020: 

* Chicago O’Hare (ORD)
* Houston Bush Intercontinental (IAH)
* Jackson, Mississippi (JAN)
* Savannah, Georgia (SAV)
* Miami and Sarasota in Florida
* Fresno (FAT), Palm Springs (PSP) and Santa Barbara (SBA) in California
* Colorado Springs (COS), Montrose/Telluride (MTJ), and Steamboat Springs (HDN) in Colorado
* Cozumel (CZM) in Mexico. 

&#x200B;

[$LUV recovery is going well as the pandemic persists.   Massive demands for travel coming in March... Summer of 2021 will be a record for air travel... Thanksgiving and Christmas will be off the charts... ](https://preview.redd.it/4k8twynv4xf61.png?width=1994&format=png&auto=webp&s=574a353ca0e66a0ff9a841319fa0b29641e3e481)

3.  Passenger traffic is likely to be severely depressed until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely distributed.

* Southwest no longer operates only Boeing 737 aircraft.  Unit expenses are likely to decrease, as the 737 MAX is recertified (as of November 18th, 2020).
   * LUV is the king of US domestic air travel and has the strongest balance. 115 million Americans will be fully vaccinated by Summer, another 100 million by end of Summer. These 215 million will be living life like 2019. The other 115 million by New Years. LUV will be back to 2019 peaks in 2022. **Buy now for the bargain pricing. It will be a bumpy flight for a while, but calm and smooth in 2022.** 
* Ultra-low-cost carriers, such as Spirit and Frontier, show that the leisure market can serve consumers that are particularly cost-conscious.

Great management and company. Definitely took advantage of the pandemic to make inroads into other major cities. Definitely coming out strong after this pandemic.Looking at the price, I'd say the recovery is already priced in, sitting at 90% of the pre-pandemic levels. So it looks like you're buying something that already has a 2022-2023 recovery to pre-pandemic conditions priced in, but you are definitely taking in the risk that the financial crisis is sticking around a lot longer and flying levels are not going back to normal for far longer.Wow sick dd man the information you provided really makes me want to invest in LUV for big short term gains

Edit: he edited his post to actually contain informationMorgan Stanley also has this as Overweight. It’s on my long play list.u/met76You have to factor in their aircraft. A lot were bought around the same time and those 737s are getting long in the tooth. So either Maintenance and time off from departure will increase or there will be new aircraft (luckily I think the new 737 might be going on sale and I know LUv already bought some).
Not arguing against the long. You also have to factor in aircraft and maintenance into evaluations like thisI would buy $LUV just because I love flying with them and they have a great reputation. Add in this quality info and it makes me feel even betterI feel like any of the major airlines is a good long play. If they're doing well with travel restrictions imagine how they're gonna do after we start to see those restrictions lifted. South west definitely one of the ones I'm looking at.All the North American and Euro airlines, and by some end Boeing and Airbus are good long termers into 2022, Asked in the daily and everyone seemed to agree, after some reading, the leisure market will be nuts in the coming 2 years.

489,German News article.,,https://www.zeit.de/2021/06/gamestop-aktie-wallstreet-hedgefonds-kapitalismus-marxismus-kulturkampf,"Nice news for a change: The American hedge fund Melvin Capital has lost more than six billion dollars, half of its assets. This was made possible by small investors who joined forces in the Reddit Internet forum to undo risky speculation by the fund. You better read how that went in the economic section - we here in the features section are simply happy about the small victory of the Internet horde against the investment professionals. For us, the price turbulence called short squeeze is a long-awaited sign of hope: Ding-dong, the great culture war in which we have been wasting each other for years, is now really over. We are just leaving, that's how a clever head interpreted the whole thingshort squeeze story on Twitter, the Age of the Joker, and a new age begins - that of Bane.

Brief Explanation: Bane and Joker are two villains from the Batman comics, and they embody opposing villain ideologies. So far the ideology of the joker has been valid - the evil clown, the offended man for whom everything is just a bad joke. In him, young, white computer gamers and comic fans recognized themselves as preferred, exaggerated and bored men who gathered in Internet forums and turned out to be evil trolls when they covered women's accounts with hatespeech or voted Trump ""for the lulz"" . They longed to go back to the good old days, when feminists hadn't yet tweeted their dirty mangas and they could still buy video games in the cozy shopping mall and then go to the cinema.



This article is from the TIME No. 06/2021. You can read the entire issue here.
A fatal mistake by hedge fund managers, betting on falling prices at an electronics retailer and a cinema chain. Because with it they aroused the nostalgic resentment of the Joker men. Suddenly they want to get out of the dreary internet culture war and into the class war against Wall Street. The trolls are now ambushing the hedge fund managers; Since the financial crisis they still have something to do with them. Your new hero is the villain Bane. Unlike the brightly made-up Joker, Bane doesn't shine with post-modern hide-and-seek games. He's all muscle mass, so a real materialist who made his big appearance in the movie The Dark Knight Riseshad when he turned the underclass against the financial elite of the city of Gotham. Because Bane is no longer interested in symbols, he wants to go where power and money are. And Melvin Capital is actually a good target there. In any case, a better one than the account of any net feminist.Wtf?",1612644434.0,15

493,Short sellers may have doubled down on GME since the big rally to $300+. Here's a list of evidence that brought me to that conclusion:,"**#1: GVIP has dominated the S&P 500 in performance over the last week**

Some context:

GVIP is an ETF that tracks popular hedge fund long bets.

Below is a chart that compares the 5 day performance of the GVIP ETF vs the S&P 500.

https://preview.redd.it/1h510wt7zwf61.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=492289c4e6f30184c160a133188a3e9331e17f7d

Over the last week (Friday last week to Thursday this week) GVIP has outperformed the S&P 500 by 2.3%. That's a TON. Furthermore if you do the same comparison for Monday this week to Thursday the outperformance of GVIP rises to approximately 4.4%, for Monday-Friday the outperformance was 2.3%

To put this into perspective look at the historical performance of these two side by side since Jan 1st 2017 (essentially inception of GVIP) and you can see that GVIP in the past has modestly outperformed the s&p 500 with GVIP returning on average (roughly) 1.69% per month and the S&P 500 returning on average (roughly) 1.12% per month (A total of 127% gain for GVIP and a 73% gain for S&P 500 over \~49 months). 2%+ out performance over a short period of time (a week or less) is massive variance to the long term monthly averages.

https://preview.redd.it/ygm5yajozwf61.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9000948cfa0326740c27e4dc98118d416441906

My hypothesis here: Hedge funds have been increasing short bets (on gamestop and other stocks) and plowing the cash they are receiving from the short sales into their favorite stocks. This pumps GVIP higher explains some of the difference in short term performance

**#2: Short Volume has increased as a percent of total volume**

First up its important that I note the different between short VOLUME and short INTEREST. Short volume refers to the number of shares sold/bought in short trades each day. Short interest is the total outstanding number of shorted shares.

A large increase in short volume as a percent of total volume indicates that something is going on. As you can see from the chart below this new activity started on 12/27 (the day that gamestop had the highest price) and continued. While its hard to tell what is actually going on here it looks like there has been a paradigm change

My thesis/opinion: Short sellers have been doubling down with the recent price increases. A combination of a high amount of short selling (as a percent of total volume) and lower liquidity is fueling the current price drop

&#x200B;

[Data from the FINRA website](https://preview.redd.it/rcw6z3sc0xf61.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ff189db2a4d6483326048cb5aaff889097b54e6)

**#3: Price changes in gamestop stock seem to be strategically timed with short interest reports**

Every 15 days the SEC requires shorts sellers to report their positions. This information is then made public 7 days later. It just so happens that 1/29 was the reporting date for short interest (to be published 2/9). I've placed 4pm on 1/29 on a chart of gamestop below:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7wf4nfhg0xf61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dbefb85fe92c694ca2765112c8c64fdac48eac0

My opinion: Short sellers want to give the impression that they closed their positions - so that we get paper hands. To do this they exited (or pretended to exit by substituting their positions for naked sold call options) leading up to the reporting deadline. Now they may have started to re-enter those positions

**#4: Anecdotal evidence**

4a: People have been posting screencaps to this subreddit that shows overwhelming good sentiment for gamestop stock. One of the things I've seen pop up on this sub lately is the total volume of buy/sell orders from retail brokerages. These have been skewing very positive still. If its not the retail investors selling, then it must be institutions either exiting long positions or starting new short positions

4b: The diamond hands on WSB are real, and sentiment has been fairly positive (despite sub drama, and a massive price drop)

4c: It appears there is a continued effort to spread disinformation and to keep the stock price down. Anyone seen those advertisements for silver lately? Why would someone go to all this effort if short positions have been exited?

4d: S3 partners estimate of short interest (as of about 7pm on 2/4) is around 26MM shares (see below). This is down from the official short interest number on 1/15 of 61MM shares. If we truly underwent a short squeeze, would half of them still be here?

https://preview.redd.it/f9j635jt0xf61.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9581436ed635e04f42f0e261350d0a7963a18ba

**#5: Interactive Brokers Short Interest Data on 2/5**

On Friday (2/05) morning we experienced a big jump in gamestop's stock price (to around $82 by 10am). Around the same time the short share availability dropped over 1MM shares at interactive brokers for gamestop.

[The first column is the borrowing cost, second column is number of shares available](https://preview.redd.it/vc38orqv1xf61.png?width=380&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9b86977a889343bd18c9b01d56d22ec6d33d01a)

My Thesis: While short share availability can drop for a number of reasons (and there is no requirement to immediately sell borrowed shares) its my opinion that that someone borrowed a bunch of shares from interactive brokers and shorted the morning's spike which halted momentum in the stock price

\_\_\_\_\_

TLDR:

My opinion: What we experienced the other day was a half baked short squeeze, the game isn't over and shorts are still playing. However, these shorts may have taken positions at higher prices and lower borrowing rates (see above screenshot) and therefore may be harder for gamestop to shake.

💎✋🚀🌖Yeah, unfortunately, even the upcoming Feb 9th report may not tell the full picture, going by this DD. I am going to hold as I believe in the company's transformation but people may start getting impatient if they are told to wait for the Feb 24th report, then the March report and so on, while the shorts keep manipulating.

All we can do is hope the long whales want to squeeze this after the report on Tuesday.Its definitely not over. All they’ve done is kick the can down the road far enough to kill the hype and form some semblance of a strategy.....

Problem is, they are waaayyyyy too deep in the first place and are now scrambling to find a way out of a position of exposure that defies all logic. 💎🙌’s breaks the game eventually. Patience.

*Edit* : I’m not a financial advisor, i just smoke a lot of weed and think about what i’d do it I were in their predicament...

I’d unwind my disaster of an investment as controlled as I could. A small squeeze to get all early investors out, cut the music before it gets out of hand, strategically trapping the 🦍’s who got in on the way up, demoralize them for a while watching the price tank destroying paper hands, then engineer another “squeeze” up to the same/similar price point so all the 💎 🙌 unload just to get off the fucking roller coaster. Rinse, repeat until i’m covered.I’ll take holding for 800 AlexI imagine many investors who weren't invested in GME in any way saw an opportunity to short at the 300+ mark. I remember seeing an interview with one investor who said he had opened a short position when it was high. He even said he might get squeezed out like the rest and accepted that, but more than likely the price would come down, which it did.

You can't expect a double-digit stock to go to 400 dollars and not attract a shit ton of new short positions.Ngl it’s discouraging seeing almost everyone in most posts saying that it’s over, I’m still holding just for the heck of it but not optimistic about us dealing them a big enough blow or even breaking even

500,So is there like a TLDR update to the GME situation??,"I haven't invested as Covid-19 really nuked my income. But I've been following the story and wow it's amazing what's been done. Feels like the first good thing to happen in this country after a very long period of bullshit jenga.

Anyways, I don't think I'm the only one that thinks the story is getting a bit complicated. There are those that say hold and those that say sell. 

Forgive me if I'm waaay off but I've never even dabbled in stocks, but I don't think I'm completely hopeless. Correct me if I'm wrong here:

* The shorts that hedgfunds were holding have already been sold right? Because robinhood forced the price to go down so that the hedge funds could minimize their loses before they were forced to sell. I assume the shorts were sold as MSM are reporting the losses at 50billionish. I guess I'm asking if the squeeze is still going on or if it happened and now there is another squeeze going to happen or what?

* If that's right why are people on WSB still holding?? Also with people cashing out which I don't see as bad, because the whole point was the screw over the %1 and take that money from them put it in our pockets, I would assume right now is the best time to short. Right??

* In what situation would GME go back up right now??",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le5wib/so_is_there_like_a_tldr_update_to_the_gme/,"Sir this is a carnival cruise shipWe don’t know for sure whether they exited their positions or not. 

Theoretically the price should have soared much higher than it did if they were all able to do so, or even if they had the last week or so the price should have risen.

On the flip side many sites are reporting the short interest down to like 50% (which we won’t know for sure until the 9th but there’s ways you can roughly estimate it). Also the price completely crashed and people are saying if HFs didn’t exit before there’s no reason why they wouldn’t now.

Many people are holding for multiple reasons. They bought at the peak expecting it to boom and were left holding the bag, people are optimistic that GME has potential long term (would still be dumb to buy in now imo), and of course they think the squeeze could still happen.

Obviously with the way the price crashed it’s not looking good for those hoping for a short squeeze. That being said, we won’t know for sure until next week. It’s always possible HFs doubled down at some point and could get burned again, and the price rise on Friday was interesting/promising for the bag holders.OK here's the deal with short interest from someone who was in early:

1. When a stock trades at a certain level for a long time - like GME, which was under $10 for a long time and under $20 until mid-Jan - you can have an idea of short position. If a stock reaches an all-time-high price, by definition every short position prior to that is underwater.

2. When a stock is heavily shorted and this happens, there is further upward pressure on the price as short interests get margin called, interest costs increase, etc. The size and value of the shorter's portfolio dictate this - first small, then progressively larger investors/funds.

3. The difficulty arises when a stock is BELOW its ATH. The only information that will ever be publicly available is ""number of shares sold short"". In the last year, GME has gone from under $3 to $483. If you have a short position at $4, you are absolutely bleeding (frankly I don't think any broker would allow a client to maintain this position when it spiked but I could be wrong). If you have a short position over $300, you are printing money.

EDIT: tl;dr: There will not be an opportunity for retail investors to understand overall short position until/if stock price exceeds former ATH. Anyone who tells you different is speculating. When this jumped to $40 from under $20 we knew, by definition, that the 140% of short interest was losing money. Until (IF) this gets to $500, everyone is just guessing about short profit or loss.- People (HFs) that shorted at $4 got fisted when price went to $300-400. 
- They covered and shorted again at $300
- GME dropped below $300
- Dudes that shorted at $300 made much $$$

Will the price go up again? Probably not. Unless, perhaps, in the coming weeks people again decide to buy in like crazy and push it beyond its ATH. 

But why the hell would that happen?r/tradingtherapyCue the HF shills telling people to sell.everyone fucked up by not selling high and buying lowThese are questions for the leader of WSB💎👐🚀🌒Yeah, but it's all in emojis like ancient Egyptian",1612642871.0,1

507,What the F is share lending? 🚀🚀🚀,"I read several comments and posts across reddit talking about not lending your GME shares for shorting. But there seems to be a lot of misinformation or lack of understanding around this topic. I'm not going to tell you what to do, but only what it is. 

Most proper brokerages have share lending programs, which you have to sign up for and only then they can lend your shares for shorting. In return you get a part of borrowing fee, which differs based on short interest. These programs may have different but similar names in different brokerages such as fully paid security lending (ally) but are available in most brokers.

One of the biggest condition for the program is that security should be fully paid i.e. not on margin. Now we know most of retail shares of a particular popular stock are not on margin anymore. 

Brokers need to place a security cash deposit for you when borrowing your stocks since during lending you dont get SIPC protection on your stocks. 
~~A little conspiracy theory here, during a short squeeze brokers that have lent out shates would be killed for that security cash requirement. So that explains why they want to avoid squeeze.~~

Anyway, Is it possible that you have signed up for such a program without knowing? Yes, and that you can check by simply calling broker and asking about the program and telling to opt out of it.  You can also google ""your brokerage"" ""share lending program"" to find out what fancy name your brokerage has given, so you dont sound retard when calling them to opt out of it. 

One catch though- wsb favorite Robinhood doesnt have any such program, meaning they can and they will lend out your security without your permission and without sharing any borrowing fee/interest with you.

510,Question 1: Why is Biocryst (BCRX)'s Berotralstat not priced in at all!?,"This post comes directly from u/bio9999 .. If you are interested in some amazing DD - give him a follow. Also, we actually have our very own subreddit so please feel free to take a look there as well for all the DD you could ever want and need! r/bcrx 💎🚀

&#x200B;

First we are going to look at **Biocryst’s** recently approved drug **Berotralstat**, AKA **Orladeyo**. It is a **once-a-day pill** given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called **Hereditary Angioedema**, that results in them having to **frequently visit the Emergency Room** for life-threatening angioedema attacks (check out Youtube for videos of HAE patients suffering from these attacks and using Berotralstat). It is estimated that this disease affects **1 in 50,000** people in the world, or roughly **140,000 people**, so although considered a rare disease, it is still affecting a **lot** of folks. The available treatments for this disease are **all IV drugs** that are painful and produce local reactions. Berotralstat is the **first oral drug**. It achieved excellent results in phase 3 trials, and the US FDA gave it **fast track**status in 2018 and Japan gave it **Sakigake** status (type of fast track). Then **on December 3rd, the US granted approval for the drug**. They did it very importantly with **zero label** statements--meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers. **On January 22nd, Japan granted approval**. The **EU** also met last week to discuss approval and will announce its result **this quarter**.

So let's look at what the above means for this stock. First the drug is in **HIGH** demand. In the US there are at least **10,000** people with HAE. Despite the disease being frequently debilitating, patients are so uncomfortable about getting regular injections that **only 7,500** are currently being treated with IV injections. The other 2,500 are going **untreated** despite the high risks. Now let's look at the 7,500 patients on a prophylactic treatment. Based on numerous surveys by doctors, the company, and researchers, most of these people would prefer an oral treatment. Take a look at this peer-reviewed survey article finding that **98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment**.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/)

No wonder then that one of the preeminent biotech analysts, Evercore's Liisa Bayko, wrote to her clients on December 4th that Berotralstat was likely to quickly **take at least 30% of the HAE market**based on Evercore surveys of patient and doctor demand.

Remember that this is **just the US**.... Japan did not even have any prophylactic treatment until Berotralstat was approved there a few days ago. They have **500 people registered with HAE** and estimated **2,000 ready to be registered**. The **UK** is so desperate to add the drug for its patients, it did not even wait until the formal approval process to go through and gave **early access to the drug on November 9th**. [https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:\~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval](https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval).

The EU is not far behind, with its estimated **20,000 patients**, with approval coming in the next few weeks. Then there is the rest of the world. The HAE patient population in **Latin America** is estimated by **HAE International**, the most important advocacy organization for HAE patients worldwide and one of **Berotralstat’s biggest supporters**, to be **over 15,000 patients**, the vast majority of whom are poorly diagnosed and not prophylactically treated. Argentina and Brazil have the highest actual diagnostic rates. HAEI through its Latin American sister organizations is strongly advocating for Berotralstat in Latin America.

Next, it should be noted that Biocryst built a **world-class sales team** for this drug in the US and EU and signed a **partnership with Torii in Japan** to take charge of the large sales and marketing promotion there. It has hired dozens of professionals, most from its HAE competitors. Its **vice-president** and US general manager **Allen Hodge** was even responsible for the **successful efforts of the HAE drug launches** of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task.

It should also be pointed out that this drug, an oral kallikrein inhibitor, is potentially of **huge value for a host of diseases, including COVID-19** (that is now recognized to severely affect the kallikrein-kinin system, and kallikrein inhibitors have begun to be tested against COVID19--see this (IV) **kallikrein inhibitor trial that was just announced in Brazil** for instance: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/)), **diabetic macular edema** (which Biocryst just obtained a patent on a technique to administer kallikrein inhibitors for), many autoimmune diseases, and even some types of cancer.

Last but not least, how should this stock be valued based on this one drug? First, this drug is **one of the 10 most expensive drugs** (based on its annual cost of prescription) in the world, but still **less than the price of its IV competitors**, at $488,000 per patient per year. This drug is being approved by insurance companies **left, right, and center** as their preferred treatment, all you have to do is follow **R8** or **nickpd** on Stocktwits to see how many insurance companies have been making it easy for patients to sign up for the drug. **Optime care** even lets patients get **direct-to-patient** prescriptions now ([https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks)). So what does all this mean for sales? And why is the stock not valued based on just this drug alone (I will get to the others in **future posts**)? I **estimate conservatively** that by December 2021, there will be **over 6,000 patients on Berotralstat in the US, EU and Japan**, and I can share in a future post the graphs and calculations I made to get to those numbers. 6,000 patients annualized is up to **$2.9 billion in annual sales**. **Most** of this is going to be **profit**. At a **conservative price to sales ratio of 7**, that should produce a price of **$121, not $8.52**! And that is **just the beginning**. Because Factor D and Galidesivir are going to be much bigger than Berotralstat for reasons I will explain in future posts. Remember that \*\*its Factor D drug, which is showing superiority to all other anti-complement drugs in Phase I trials and was fast-tracked and given orphan status by the FDA and now is in Phase 2 though not officially announced by the company eyt,\*\*and can be used in at least 20 diseases including common ones like Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently **not even factoring into BCRX's valuation**. Consider that **Alexion with its significantly inferior anti-complement drug was just sold to Astra-Zeneca for $39 billion** because of the **recognized potential of anti-complement drugs** for a host of diseases. BCRX even has has **other drugs like Peramivir, already approved for Influenza and able to be used for the next bird flu pandemic, and its FOP drug--a story for another day**.

So why is this company, with **zero risk of dilution** due to an **amazing royalty deal** it signed in December and **three super-drugs** each worth tens of billions of dollars, and a host of other exciting developments to look forward to, **worth only $1.5 billion right now?** It can only be because the company's stock has been **relentlessly shorted in 2020 and 2021** to allow for significant accumulation by institutions. That is why the stock **only went up 168%**, yes ""***ONLY***"" **168%**... The time for BCRX investors is **now**. My next post will be about Factor D, brace for that one. Factor D is 10 times bigger than Berotralstat! Good luck to all!

For those unaware, UpToDate is the resource that the majority of physicians, pharmacists, and other prescribers use in North America when selecting therapeutic options for clients. Never in my 5 years of schooling, or in my 3 years of practice have I ever seen an injectable be selected as the first option for treatment. **The fact this is already being selected as a preferred treatment option despite only being approved for a couple weeks is astonishing. The progress this company has made in such a short period of time is almost unheard of.** 

First, lets consider an obvious one. Type 2 Diabetes has a plethora of oral options available as treatment. I have patients that are on 4+ different Oral antihyperglycemic medications with differing MOA's, when they could simply switch to insulin and potentially be on no pills. Why is this the case? Because injectables are considered by 95% of patients a last case resort if nothing else is working. People HATE injectables, and this is only a SC insulin shot. That is nothing when you compare some of the different injectables out there such as the ones used for HAE.

**Orladeyo WILL be the standard of care (first line option) for HAE prophylaxis.**I found this website listing the Top 10 Expensive Prescription Drugs and you weren't kidding: Alexion's **Soliris** (to treat PNH) and Takeda's **Cinryze** (to treat HAE) is on this website. It's so crazy to see how undervalued BCRX is.

he didn't sold at 420 and im sure glad he didn't because i believe they could have gone after him.

now for the ape that diamond hand and all that, please still hold. i love that stock for real and i wanna see gamestop succeed in the future. i could spend hours in that store when i was younger and i can see a brick and mortar store opened in big cities with a good chunk of online retails. who knows .. they could become the amazon of games.

519,A little story about $GME,"The year is 2050... a civilian is strolling along the city streets and notices a homeless man in a large coat with a hood over his head. The homeless man is sitting on a park bench, rugged, clothes drenched and stained. This man has evidently been homeless for quite some time. Our friendly civilian approaches the homeless man, a single dollar bill in hand. “Excuse me sir, I don’t have much to give, I paperhanded GME back in 2021, but I hope this dollar helps.” The homeless man looks up, through the grime and dirt on his face our civilian is still able to recognize him. “Oh my goodness, you’re Diamond Hand Dumbass!” “Indeed I am.” Replies the homeless man. He struggles to outstretch his hands, as they’ve become increasingly heavy from years of hodling GME shares. He gratefully accepts the mans single dollar bill... “This dollar is more than I deserve my new friend.” Says Dumbass. Dumbass pulls out his Nokia flip phone and dials up his broker. “Yes I’d like 10 shares of GME (the stock is now 10 cents a share).” He once again averages down his share price. The friendly civilian looks at him completely astonished... Dumbass gets off the park bench, looks to the man, and before walking away musters up the unspoken phrase lost decades ago...

521,"Three words: Altria, Marijuana, Legalization (MO)","I keep an eye on Altria, owner of Phillip Morris, because I live in Richmond, their hometown and headquarters.

The Virginia legislature just legalized Marijuana for recreational use. If you aren't familiar with Virginia politics let me tell you: this is a big deal. Virginia legalizing could be the gateway for more conservative states.I think we could be looking at Federal legalization within the next four years, and probably sooner.

 Altria bought a 45% stake in Cronos, a marijuana technology company. There are few companies I can think of that are better positioned to profit from national legalization than Altria. 

ATM Calls expiring January 2022 are only 3.40. Calls expiring a year later are only a dollar more. I think if we saw an end to Federal prohibition during the next year, we could see Altria stock move up significantly. It's down 50% in the last couple years and could be poised for a big move. 

MO: 21 JAN 22 42.5 C",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le54rc/three_words_altria_marijuana_legalization_mo/,"Arizona & Montana just legalized. They are more conservative states...MO owner here. That dividend is juicy, I’m cool with owning shares and collecting that income whilst waiting for legalization.

Vaping with their JUUL stake is also a huge possibility IMO. The whole BS in the US about it’s dangers was a bunch of idiots using additives causing issues. Quality controlled vape is a big win from a harm reduction POV, and vaping can become a big growth driver if the US takes the direction the UK did on the issue.Tlry for me. Big position in stock at 8.80 and LEAPs

Edit: I think analysts shooting for 3-4yrs for legalization are far too conservative. 1-2 for me. Kamala and Schumer are intentionally prioritizing it. Now we get the SJW push too plus the taxation argument so it’s been looking better than ever. Dem senate already figuring out power dynamics to proceed without 60/40 votes, EZ. Should be a huge topic on wsb coming up soon.That isn't entirely accurate. Both chambers passed bills, but there are differences that have to be sorted out. Nothing has been put before the governor as of this past Friday. It may be a couple of weeks before that happens.

The Company’s goal is to remain a leader in regulated industries and other core verticals by continuing to extend the functionality of its secure BlackBerry Spark® software platform (UEM + UES).

# How does the EV Sector Exponential Growth help BB?

Well, the 2020 to 2022 is a period for gaining significant momentum in the Smart EV sector and which shall rapidly accelerate from 2023 to 2025. As we are noticing multiple companies in EV sector trying to launch their products.

Most of the companies would love to be part of the growing EV sector as it just the beginning excluding TESLA. They will eventually develop products/platforms for OEM's and Tier1 and provide it as a service.

As EV sector evolves more, we should see more partnerships across other companies which aren't part of BB yet might be inclined to use at least one product. As the BB product offerings are diverse and the customer success stories about how they have played a role while manufacturing their own EV products with minimal efforts can boost the marketing efforts.

Chen stated they are going after the other 6 OEM's which aren't using the Blackberry yet. Currently, BlackBerry QNX has design wins with 19 of top 25 Electric Vehicle OEMs, who together have 61% of EV market.

# How is BB coping up during the COVID?

The company expects BlackBerry QNX revenue to be negatively impacted by a slowdown in automotive market related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of which could be partially offset by increased customer demand for the Company’s endpoint security and productivity solutions that support business continuity and remote working environments, including the BlackBerry Spark platform, SecuSUITE and BlackBerry AtHoc.

# What's upcoming and where is BB focusing strategically?

The Company is developing a concept system to integrate BlackBerry Spark capabilities, including AI and machine learning technologies, with BlackBerry QNX automotive solutions. Have to watch out for more information during the earnings calls.

# How was the Customers growth among BB products?

QNX was acquired by BB in 2010, right from that moment, BB started its journey in Automotive industry. Initially, it has launched Infotainments and Telematic under QNX product category and it was deployed on leading car manufacturers.

* 2018 - 120 Million
* 2019 - 150 Million
* 2020 - 175 Million

There are currently 1.4 billion cars approximately.  In 2018, approximately 4.2 million heavy commercial vehicles and just over 20 million light commercial vehicles were produced throughout the world.

It’s estimated to have at least 470 million cars by 2025.

As there are many modules under QNX, like hypervisor, ADAS, clusters, cockpit, IVI. The cost ranges anywhere from the low-single digit dollars to literally high-single digit or low-double digit dollars per module.

Trefis estimates BlackBerry generates about $4 in QNX revenue per vehicle. Automakers are only expected to ship about 62 million new vehicles this year, according to Statista Research. Assuming QNX is installed on at least half of those vehicles, BlackBerry would generate about $120 million in annual sales -- or nearly a fifth of its trailing 12-month software and services revenue -- from QNX this year.

Unfortunately, we don't know the exact price the QNX OS costs or per say other modules under QNX. If more modules of QNX are used, then it's adds up and the Average Rate for Per Unit might be 4x or 5x.

This gives us an idea about how to get more revenue from QNX itself when the manufacturer would use other modules under QNX apart from OS.

We have already seen list of the OEM's from previous posts and in the above spreadsheet you saw list of the QNX products certain OEM's are using

IoT subscription period is typically 4 yrs.

**Radar Pricing:**

Estimation in 2017:

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar.

The Go-to-Market objective is to have approximately a 50-50 split in Radar sales between BlackBerry’s channel partners and its direct sales force. BlackBerry Radar partners typically sell only this particular solution.

Recently, BB was able to expand channel ecosystem to more than 12 channel partners, this new partnership might help BB capture more of the logistics and transportation area.

**Cylance Pricing:**

Cylance might charge 55$ per endpoint per year.

Announced that Forrester found that BlackBerry Cylance’s AI-driven endpoint security products delivered a 99 percent return on investment. We will see more revenue in 2021 as we shared earlier that customers who bought UEM are excited about UES too.

At present, the market share is below 1%.

**Projected Product Sector Revenue Growth by 2025:**

**QNX:**

According to survey, the Global In-Vehicle Infotainment Market size is expected to reach $42.7 billion by 2025 (This is where we shall see more competition from different OEM manufacturers as they build their own products)

Global Market Insights, Inc. has recently added a new report on automotive operating system market which estimates the global market valuation for automotive OS will cross US$ 4.5 billion by 2026

And the QNX OS (Just the OS) segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 15% from 2020 to 2026

We have to know what the priority level for BB for this product and how much market share they are targeting in the upcoming years. It’s quite early to say about it and the contribution to the revenue is insignificant compared to other products.

**Challenges:**

QNX:

Toyota, VW, Mercedes Benz have started taking route of AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) which is an open source (free to use) which implies the QNX market share in OS is waning. These are big manufacturers and how blackberry shall adapt is wait and see game.

There is always a case where companies might decide not to use more of the QNX modules just the OS, this will impact the Average Selling Price (ASP) per car as well as the revenue since those modules add up 4x-5x ASP.

IVY:

Revenue from Blackberry IVY shall be more reflective from 2023, stated by Chen. So, there is uncertainty in this area and no revenue estimate. We have to see how this partnership plays out how companies are willing to adopt cloud platform for insights and management of the automotive software’s.

Cylance:

Currently, the market is highly competitive, and BB has to make it way to top 10 and capture more market share. In 2021, it shall unfold more about it as we are seeing rapid growth in IoT sector across various sectors.

The BB is in the right position to capture more of the automotive market and we have to see how it shall play out in coming years when EV sector is full blown and more cars are delivered, and security threats increase. Also, it offers the endpoint protection, which certainly companies can benefit but not necessarily the SMB which are driven through e-commerce platforms.

Radar:

It’s barely scratching the surface in this sector and as there are bigger sharks who have been in the market for long time.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company previously stated that it expected to generate $100 million in cumulative revenue from its BlackBerry Radar asset tracking solution over the next three years. The Company no longer expects to generate this revenue within this time frame. (This is a set back and there are other competitors who have been in the Logistics and Transportation Industry for quite some time).

In general, BB has to pitch itself more aggressively in other sectors especially in Medical, Industrial, Oil and Energy. Considering the certifications they have and the clients they serve.

Target Price in 2021: 25-30 (by not considering crazy valuations into account). I personally believe if the IVY platform and Spark product revenue increases then we can certainly see the stock price 4x-5x in coming years.

Positions: 400 shares @ 12 and 2 Jan 20 2023 SP 15. I plan to add more as I see the potential and growth in the newly introduced products.

527,Some Smoothbrain Real Talk for Everyone at WSB,"Okay dumb-dumbs since I'm seeing the gain porn and lecturing from long time members here's a story for you all idiots that I think might help.

I've never really invested in a portfolio. My whole life I was taught two things: **keep your money in safe, steady growth locations, have have multiple locations.** So, that's what I've done. I have a savings account, a Roth IRA, a retirement fund, and as of May 2020, a portfolio. I started real small, with $1000. That money quickly grew to about $1300 and I realized that I could make smart buying decisions based on the news and my friend's (who is a CFA) advice). He convinced me to invest in some tech stonks early on as well as some other endeavors that have paid out handsomely. Not much in terms of gross $$, but from a % growth standpoint the money was huge.

Over time I started putting money that would normally go into my savings into my portfolio because, well, it was growing so much faster. I had a lot of growth off of tech stock investments, and now I have my hands in some fairly lucrative pies. **I then learned about WSB in mid-January and saw everything that was going on with GME, et. al.** I was skeptical, so I watched the market for a while. I thought 'oh hey, this could be a fun gamble, let's play ball.' I bought 10 shares of BB at $10. As it blew up I prowled the posts and saw that while GME was at $50, AMC was only at $5, and the plan to squeeze was targeted at both of them. So I bought 60 shares of AMC @ $5. A few days later, specifically, on January 29th, my money had exploded so I said okay one more small buy. I tossed in for 1 share of GME at $320, three shares of KO$$ at 69. **One hour later RH restricted buying.**

I guess I should've just dumped everything right there but I loved the camaraderie that I saw here. Obviously, I knew that a reddit sub wasn't about to take down any major hedge funds, but I did see an opportunity to expose these assholes like in 2008. So I held. Then when GME started to fall, I bought another 4 shares at $85, and I tossed my remaining balance on AMC. Everything together we're looking at about $1,500 put toward this effort.

Obviously, the outlook isn't a whole lot better today than it was this time last week. And yet, I'm holding. Why? Why would I hold after admitting I made an objectively stupid series of buys? Answer: Because I can afford to, and because I like to gamble. It's fun to me. I'm not rich by any measure, but I'm smart enough to understand that this is a group of RETARDS who know very little about finances. So I wanted to have fun with it, and I decided to invest about 10% of my portfolio into this mess. That said, my portfolio only makes up about 10% of my total net worth, if even that much. **So, at best, I've invested 1% of my net worth into this ""movement.""**

The moral of my story should be clear:

# You're all idiots. I'm an idiot. This is DUMB.

But it's also fun. And you know what? If you put 80% of your life savings into buying GME at $350, you're a fucking dumbass. That is not, and has never been how money works. **These guys posting loss and gain porn on this site? There's what, two dozen of them? Out of 8,500,000?!** Come on, stop. You think you're going to outsmart a series of billionaires just because some guy who bought 50,000 shares of a dead stock in July said it might work one of these days? Stop it, get some help.

And to the ""OG members"" who think that they are just so smart for manipulating the market at a FRACTION of the efficiency, stealth, and organization that hedge fund operators do it EVERY DAY, I say you can lick my nutsack from the back. Cool, a couple hundred people got lucky and ya caught Melvin off guard for a week. But honestly, shame on you assholes for screaming ""HOLD HOLD HOLD"" when GME was tanking from 400 all the way down to 120. **People were watching their lives disintegrate because of a damn joke that they weren't in on from the gate.** Guess what, you're Melvin now. You fucked the little guy and got rich doing it. How's it feel?

529,What are the Risk Departments doing right now?,"The recent run-up of GME from $4 -> $500 caught a bunch of people with their pants down, such as hedge funds, brokers, and market makers. The entire world was watching and NOBODY wants to be exposed to this type of event again.

I'm losing hope that this type of thing will happen again in the next 10 years.

**TL;DR - Why this won't happen again**

1. Every financial institution is now aware of this type of risk
2. They have every analyst working to mitigate this in the future
3. They are learning how to break the rules better

# What are the Risk departments doing right now?

**Background:** I was a Data Scientist in the Risk/Underwriting department of a finance company for 3 years (not on wallstreet, just a B2C company for small consumer loans).

&#x200B;

**1. They are getting their ass handed to them.**

Risk teams hate attention because it's always bad. This is their worst nightmare.

The CEO is asking why the fuck they didn't see this coming and warn them. And why a bunch of literally retarded autists on reddit knew about this before they did.

**2. They are dedicating 100% of their resources to making sure they see this type of thing coming.**

Every Analyst up to the PhD jerkoffs that thought they were going to be playing with deep neural networks are instead currently spending all of their time running queries and making plots in excel for every ""what-if"" scenario that the executives can think of.

They may have gotten fucked last month, but now they have TONS of data to train models and run scenarios with. They are going to be ready next time.

**3. They are learning what rules they can break.**

Things like Failure-to-Deliver and limiting buys on certain securities are now additional levers that they are learning how to pull and are currently building models for. They don't give a fuck if something is ""illegal"" or ""unethical"". Instead they have a simpler function to guide their decisions:

`E(Revenue) = E(Gains from doing illegal shit) - E(Legal fees and costs)`

If they make more money doing illegal shit than it costs, then they do it.

530,110%+ institutional ownership or 110%+ short interest is NOT anything shady. What it is is incredibly bullish!,"People were shocked to hear ""over 100% of GME shares have been shorted"" or ""institutions own over 100% of GME shares.""

**""How is that possible?""**

It's actually quite simple, and nothing shady. All it shows is that the short interest is MASSIVELY overexposed, which makes them incredibly vulnerable as I'll outline below.

Here's the simple case:

Andy owns a share in a margin account. Andy's broker loans his share to Barry, who sells it. Andy sees the stock for sale, says ""I like this stock and that's a fair price"" and he buys the stock from Barry. (Andy doesn't know he's buying his own share, but it doesn't really matter.) Now Andy owns two shares and Barry is short one. Again, Barry borrows the share from Andy's broker, sells it, and Andy buys it again. Now Andy has 3 shares, and Barry is short 2. So compared to the original quantity, Andy holds 300% and Barry is short 200%!

These numbers are, for the purposes of the market, ""real"" shares. (This doesn't involve any counterfeiting or naked shorts at all.) If Charlie comes in offering a baller price, Andy can sell his three shares. That *may* cause the broker to recall the short shares from Barry, forcing Barry to now buy two shares at market price to cover.

[https://trib.com/business/investment/personal-finance/yes-a-stock-can-have-short-interest-over-100----heres-how/article\_497d907a-5107-5f0b-b983-2a118108a2d2.html](https://trib.com/business/investment/personal-finance/yes-a-stock-can-have-short-interest-over-100----heres-how/article_497d907a-5107-5f0b-b983-2a118108a2d2.html)

**""But don't shares let you vote in a stockholder meeting? How can one person vote three times with the same share?""**

They can't - it's important to understand that *you are generally forfeiting your voting rights on any share you hold in a margin account.* Shares that have been lent have no voting rights. The voting right belongs to whoever has bought a share and has *not* loaned it out. When you hold shares in a margin account, it may be loaned (you wouldn't know if it has or has not) and if it has been loaned you are not the holder of record.

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsalevotingrights.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsalevotingrights.asp)

So in my example above, even though Andy has three shares, he has a maximum of one vote because he only owns one un-loaned share.

**""This is getting boring, how does all this get me tendies?""**

NOW you're asking the right fucking question! The brokers can *only* lend out shares that are in margin accounts (often brokerage accounts may have margin enabled). They *cannot* lend out shares that are in cash accounts or accounts w/o margin (at least not without your express permission.) So if we move our shares out of margin/brokerage accounts and into cash accounts, the brokers will run low on shares to lend.

At first, if just a small number of us move to cash accounts, the effect will be subtle (but still meaningful): as the broker runs low on shares to lend, the interest rate they charge to the shorts will increase. This puts pressure on the shorts to close sooner, since their nightly interest payment increases and so they have more incentive to close their position sooner.

Now, if we ALL do this, the effect increases nonlinearly: WE COULD ACTUALLY DRIVE ANOTHER SQUEEZE. Once your broker runs out of unlent shares (which is quite likely since the short interest is so high), if you transfer your stocks from your brokerage account to a cash account, your broker will need to recall those shares, forcing the shorts to buy! And that becomes a double-whammy to all other shorts: (1) the more shorts are forced to buy by the brokers, the higher the price goes, and (2) the lower the supply of shares available to loan is, the higher the interest rate goes. The interest payment is due nightly and is based on \[current stock price\]x\[current interest price\] and this strategy drives both factors higher, ballooning the interest payment, which pressures more shorts to close... which drives the price up more, which further pressures shorts to close... i.e. a squeeze.

(I think in the past week the brokers already did run out of shares to lend, but I can't find the citation, please post in the comments if you have intel about shares available for loan or interest %s.)

**""Wait, isn't this the exact strategy that Mark Cuban told us we should use if we want a squeeze?""**

Yes, specifically his words were *""Now if #WSB did this en masse, it would be the mother of all short squeezes.""*

**""Isn't this the part where you tell me what to do and I do it?""**

Yes.

1. Open a cash account, or confirm your brokerage account has margin disabled. All new GME shares you buy, buy from this account and not your old margin account.
2. Try to transfer your shares from your margin account to a cash account. AFAIK they are not actually obligated to do this, they are only obligated to locate shares when you sell, but it's worth trying. We can give good PR to the brokerages that make it easy to transfer shares, and bad reviews for brokerages that block it.
3. If you have extra cash (and if you don't have extra cash and you're here now, may god have mercy on your retard soul) you can set up a cash account, then attempt to simultaneously buy shares in the cash account and sell them in the margin account for the same price. If you can do both transactions at the exact same price, this is identical to #2 where you're doing an in-kind transfer between accounts. The obvious risk here is that you can't control the price so you may lose money if you buy higher than you sell (but on the flip side may accidentally make money if you buy slightly low and sell slightly high).
4. Continue spreading the word - this strategy is nonlinear and is more effective the more shares we can remove from margin accounts. If just a few people do it it is still marginally effective, but if everyone does it we are looking at another squeeze.

edit: u/rozhasi says ""Both TD Ameritrade and Fidelity told me that if you remove the 'margin' feature from your current account, they can’t lend your shares to short sellers.""

edit2: Robinhood automatically has margin enabled, so we do not want to be using RH AT ALL anymore. Users report that after transferring from RH to Fidelity the Fidelity account automatically had margin enabled (even though *new* Fidelity accounts default to margin-disabled.) *If anyone has experience (A) transferring RH shares to a non-margin account, or (B) disabling margin on an account that RH shares have been transferred into, please post in the comments and I will try and add a how-to here.*

edit3: from u/A1pha101:  for all you Nords, Nordnet Investing Account Zero has share lending **on by default**, but there is a form you can fill out to disable it. I can't vet the link they sent to the form (it's in Norwegian hosted on [scrive.com](https://scrive.com)) so I'm hesitant to share it, but more info can be found here:  [https://www.nordnet.no/blogg/ekstra-inntekt-pa-utlan-av-aksjer/](https://www.nordnet.no/blogg/ekstra-inntekt-pa-utlan-av-aksjer/) . If a critical mass can link to the form and vouch it's legit I will edit it in here.

🦍💎🙌(in cash accounts, **NOT** in brokerage/margin accounts)🚀

This is not financial advice, talk to a professional if you want advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4hoh/110_institutional_ownership_or_110_short_interest/,"I spoke with both TD Ameritrade and Fidelity  yesterday on this very topic. I didn’t hear Mark Cuban suggest that. The thought came to me a couple days ago. 

Both TD Ameritrade and Fidelity told me that if you remove the “margin” feature from your current account, they can’t lend your shares to short sellers. I didn’t ask if the shares are already lent, will they be recalled if I remove the margin feature. 

It appears to me that when you open a Fidelity brokerage account, it’s automatically open without the “margin” feature enabled.  You actually have to request margin to be enabled if you need it. Once it’s enabled, your shares will be lent to short sellers. 

In TD Ameritrade, you can choose to add advance features to a brokerage account when you open a new account (or you can add advanced features later). If you don’t add them, the margin feature will not be enabled. 

If you have the margin feature enabled on your account, you can trade on margin (borrow money from the brokerage to buy stocks), you can sell short (borrow shares from the brokerage to sell them), and trade options. If you do not use any of these features, you can disable margin on your account. 

If your account has margin enabled, even if you didn’t use any margin (borrowed money) to buy shares, didn’t sell any shares short, or didn’t trade options, your shares will still be lent to short sellers. So, disable margin in your brokerage account to prevent your brokerage from lending your shares to short sellers. 

Margin is not available in retirement accounts. Only brokerage accounts have this feature.For people using DEGIRO

If you have a Custody profile great, your shares will NOT be lent. If you have a Basic profile you shares WILL be lent. To change from Basic to Custody, you will have to create a new account (multiple accounts are allowed) and choose the Custody profile. Then call DEGIRO and ask for them to transfer your shares. 

Alternatively you can sell on the old account and buy on the new but I read this might also come with extra taxesThere’s been a few posts with these new numbers (100%+ whatever). Can someone confirm these are real? If so...THE SQUEEZE OF ALL SQUEEZES IS COMING 🚀🚀🚀💎🙌Watch, this post will get removed.This is what I''ve been trying to say and tell people! Also setting sell limit orders do nothing if your account has margin enabled!!! Call your broker to make sure you dont have margin enabled and that your shares are not being lent out!!!  


I found out with etrade that all trades have to be settled for them to convert your account back to a cash account. So mine will be done on Tuesday once my Friday purchases of GME have settled. Call your broker to confirm and spread the word!!!I do remember Mark Cuban giving that answer during his AMA. Thank you for the helpful writeup and explanation.   


Position: 500 shares GME via Vanguard (no margin)So is $10K still no meme?Converted to cash account, fantastic advice.
Btw, borrowing money to invest is the most retarded thing I’ve ever heard of.After transferring my shares from RH to Fidelity, I noticed that they were lent-out on arrival. I called Fidelity customer support at 1 800 343 3548, and after exactly 61 minutes on hold they picked up. I asked them to convert my shares from margin to cash, and made sure that margin was disabled on my account.

If you transferred your shares from RH to Fidelity, I'd recommend calling.FYI, for Schwab: shares can only be lent if you’re currently borrowing funds. if you aren’t utilizing the margin feature and only using YOUR cash, you’re fine.",1612638865.0,1992

You are going to get ass fucked by iv crushCRSR is definitely good short and long, but if you’re planning to short term the best time to sell is monday when earnings will be fully priced in. This stock will not go up right after earning, like logitech it will go down after, then rebound strongly in the month after. 

Strongest play based on this theory: Sell at peak hype on monday, buy when it dips afterwards. If anyone thinks different i would definitely be interested in hearing your opinions on thisI’m super bullish on Corsair, but did you see what happened to Logitech after last earnings?",1612638751.0,112
532,Overview of Current GME Situation: It's Just Getting Started,"*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, nor am I licensed or in any way qualified to dictate or advise your trading decisions. I don't know jack shit about fuck. This is not financial advice. This analysis is not meant to influence, inspire, or inform you regarding your trades. This analysis was written purely as speculation and could be entirely incorrect. I found my own analysis interesting and wanted to share my unprofessional opinion. Furthermore, while these numbers are accurate as per their sources, they may not account for other factors that relate to the stock’s activity. I own shares of GME.*

**TLDR:** This is currently a war between funds. Your 1.41 shares don't move markets, you little fractional bitch. But if you sell at a loss right now, you're literally just giving them money like a fucking idiot.

Background: GME is owned almost exclusively by institutions and funds. 
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders/


The combined top 10 institutions + 10 funds own 88.93% of the shares. I don't know what the fuck 122.04% of Shares Held by Institutions means (may have the do with the made-up shares fuckery, but I'm not going to get into that). The point is, institutions and funds own almost everything, retail owns almost nothing.


GME was already heavily shorted by late 2020. Likely more than 80% of those shorts occurred at $4 or less. 

Late 2020 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ: https://imgur.com/a/6lH0nx5

Note on shorts: When you short a stock, you have to pay interest **DAILY** on that stock at the **CURRENT PRICE**. If the stock's price decreases, you will likely make more money from the decrease than you will lose from the interest. When the price increases significantly, the daily interest may eat at all the potential profits you were hoping to make. 

Early 2021 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ: https://imgur.com/a/BlQDgI4

As you can see above, in late January, the price of GME kept rising, and it likely became unprofitable/risky for these short sellers to continue holding their short position at these prices. They likely knew that the price was eventually going to go down, but it must have cost them a fortune on a daily basis to continue holding. This leads to some of them trying to cover their shorts, which led to the price rising even further, which led to others trying to cover their shorts, etc. Combined with retail mania, this is what created the ""squeeze.""

So the short interest goes from 102.08% to 88.58% and the price went from $35.50 to $347.51.

**Now, we know that the shorts were NOT covered.** I refer to this excellent post here as to how it's basically mathematically impossible for them to have actually covered: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/

**But there's another simple reason why the shorts weren't covered:**

**Who the fuck is going to leave their money with a fund that loses 53% of assets in a single fucking position? The ultra-wealthy whose assets these hedge funds manage would all immediately withdraw all their fucking money and sue for breach of fiduciary duty.**

Melvin may have told the media that they covered their shorts, but I guarantee they fucking called every one of their clients and told them they hadn't covered, and that they had a new plan. Get an injection of cash from Citadel and Point72 ($2.75 Billion) to pay the daily interest rates on their shorts, and run a FUD media campaign against these retail morons to sell and tell them that the squeeze is already over - while Melvin waits it out. ""The shorts have been covered, anyone left holding the bag is a fucking moron.""

So what's the current situation?

1) **Team A Hedge Funds:** These are the morons who shorted the stock at $4 and below and are currently bleeding. Some of them definitely covered and exited, but it's mathematically impossible for all of them to have covered. These are the REAL BAGHOLDERS. They literally lose money every day that they hold the short as long as the stock is over $4. They need the price to go down to reduce their daily bleed. They need to buy the stock back eventually to stop bleeding or reduce the price to $4 or below again.

2) **Team B Hedge Funds:** These are the sharks who sensed the blood in the water and shorted the stock as it was rocketing up. They hold shorts likely in the $150-$450 range. On paper, they have made a fucking fortune and are planning their next move. They love these currently ""low"" prices and want to buy back the stock and cash in their profit, but they can't do so too quickly without shooting the price up again and losing that profit margin. Because they shorted the stock, they are also bleeding. They will need to buy these stocks back eventually, before their profit goes to nothing (this could be a long long time).

3) **Team C: Institutional Holders and Fund Holders:** These guys basically hold all the shares that Team A and Team B Hedge Funds want. They're currently sitting on massive paper gains and want to squeeze Team A and Team B for every cent they have. They know Team A and Team B are bleeding, and that they must eventually buy back the stock (especially Team B since Team B wants to actually realize their profits). They're comfortable sitting on their profits, but they're also very comfortable bleeding these guys out knowing they have to buy back, and they can wipe out a competing fund in the process. They are also very happy if there is another squeeze because rather than sell 5 shares, they would love for the price to jump 500%, sell 1 share, keep 4, and continue bleeding Team A and B. 

What's happening right now is that there is a war being waged between these three groups. Do not underestimate the people who work at hedge funds - they are extremely intelligent, extremely greedy, and extremely competitive. If a retard like me can dissect the situation, they all have certainly figured it out as well. What's happening right now is they are trying to find a market equilibrium price without giving away their positions. Team A wants to cover, but can't seem desperate or else the price will skyrocket. Team B wants to ""cover,"" but can't seem greedy without eating into their profits. And Team C wants to sell and realize their profits, but they can't all do it at once without tanking the price.

**And you, my paper handed fucking mongoloid friend, when you buy high and sell low, you literally throw your fucking losses into this pool for these three to fight over as they try to minimize their losses/maximize their profits.**

The short interest is still massively high and this story is just beginning. This is not the end, despite the FUD and the shilled pessimism in WSB. Will it hit $300 again? Maybe not. Will there be massive volatility as they duke it out and the opportunity to break even/profit? Yes.

This is not financial advice. I am not telling you to hold. However, you have already paid for your ticket to this show, think about maybe sticking around for the ending.

Hello Paper Hands,

I see your posts about how you can't hold out any longer. I'm not here to tell you what to do, only to share a personal story.

I invested heavily into low and mid range Jameis Winston rookie cards shortly after he was cut from the Buccs. Retarded right? Most people thought so and card shop owners audibly laughed at my requests for them. I had them trading me Prizm Winston cards for Low End Daniel Jones and Drew Lock rookies before the 2020 season began. Then he signed with the Saints and his card value had a small jump... I could have had paper hands and took my profit then and there, but I believed the value was higher than that, I LIKED THE STOCK then as much as I do now, so I held.

Cut forward to midseason 2020, Brees goes down and Winston is not named the starter. Do I panic? No, because I trust what I see, Winston is a better QB than Taysom Hill.

Cut forward again to the NFC Playoffs, cameras catch Brees telling Winston ""This is your team now."" His price starts to climb, but hesitently as nothing is yet official. I know the Saints are not going to draft a starting QB this year, and they are in no financial situation to make a play for one on the market. So I hold, because I know the value will be higher when he is offically named the starter and the 2021 season starts.

That's 2 years of holding. Not even a scratch on these DIAMOND HANDS. 

I can honestly say the most difficult hold of all was the first one, when he signed to the Saints. The chance to get out with a small profit was tempting. Although I knew it would be a long hold, once I made the decision there was no turning back, I knew the regret of knowing I was right and went against my gut was a longer hold. I'm still holding those rookie cards btw, gonna be for atleast a little while longer. 💎👐 Right up until I believe he's hit peak value...

Hear me out, so had they done it on Friday, I think it would of triggered more people to buy and yet they waited til the weekend to showcase it, why is that? Is it perhaps a tactics used to scare people into selling on Monday before the Tuesday announcement, why after all this time when there has been a date of Feb 9th would people just cave, they already lost a huge amount of profit what's 1 more day or even waiting til opening day on Monday to decide but nah, let's sell Friday and then comment on it on Saturday, totally nothing suspect about that.",1612638680.0,24

[This post](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72m7j/when_should_we_go_all_in_on_silver/) - 10 month old account which mainly posted about MMA until 3 days ago, since then only posts have been about silver.

[This post](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l70j2t/punish_the_banks_punish_the_hedges_buy_the_one/) - year old account with sporadic posting history....until 3 days ago when they started posting about silver.

Realistically, it would probably cost around $1500 to give that many awards to that post. $1500 is pocket change to firms like Citron which hold a big stake in silver.

The list goes on from that obviously.

A good chunk of those accounts appear to be purchased accounts. The tell-tale sign is a huge gap in post history and way off topic posting. Anyone with a couple thousand dollars lying around could do it. For huge firms which already held millions of dollars in silver/silver securities, it's like pissing into the ocean.

It’s just a decentralized asset hedge against inflation similar to digital currency.In my opinion, the manipulation was anti-silver. I watched the smear campaign in real-time across multiple stock platforms. It was unreal and disturbing to say the least.

I was labeled a bot, shill, etc. etc. for being bullish on precious metal miners, as I have been for years.A lot of lurkers are becoming active because were fucking sick of seeing your garbage posts every single minute, of every single day.If you want to post a compelling argument saying that there's a lot of bots or bought accounts manipulating stuff you need to have an unbiased method to go through thousands of accounts.Jesus christ !!!

540,The Emotionally Intelligent Investor,"All I'm trying to tell you people  is you get laid if you said

 ""Babes it was a crazy day, but i was emotional intelligent and held. ""

Emotional Intelligence challenges several long-held assumptions and beliefs, by asserting that a good investment approach starts with introspection. Too many investment gurus tell you to emulate their techniques despite the fact that you may have very different personality traits, motivations and biases. Would Zion Williams tell a short basketball player to play like him? Investors need to create a unique template for self-reflection and a framework for developing an investment approach that works best with who you are. Whereas the consensus opinion is that investing success comes from blocking out emotions and making purely rational decisions, the best money managers actually use their feelings. They actively sense what others in the market are thinking, and they employ gut instincts when making decisions. Nevertheless, virtually all investing text books neglect to mention how to best cultivate and utilize empathetic and intuitive realizations. By creating your own investment template, you will develop an investing advantage by putting yourself in someone else’s shoes. You will also discover how a stock chart is a great tool for understanding what the current holders of a security may be feeling, and you will appreciate why technical analysis works. Superior returns primarily depend on self-awareness, empathy and intuition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le423g/the_emotionally_intelligent_investor/,"I'm sorry sir, this is the short bus.I like to press the green button and then the red button.

Some of you are holding and don't know what to do, some of you have given up, and far too many of you shitebags are chickening out like pussies, some of you want to make sensible financial decisions and gamble on stock.

You do not want to play gambling at Stock. THAT IS THEIR GAME. That is what Wall Street have always done at the DETRIMENT OF EVERYBODY ELSE. In gambling in casinos, the house always wins. Why the fuck would you want play that game in that house? When you have enough resources between you all to open your own house and close that one for good.

Playing at Stock is an OLD PERSONS GAME. You are YOUNG, You create the NEW GAME.

Of course they say you can't do this or that. No gouging, no hair pulling, no biting. Coz they don't want to lose. They tell you this is a fair game. It was never a fair game.

550,"Would like to write about my experience with the GameStop run up, and what I learned about life out of it","Hey guys. 

I made a post roughly 60 days ago about a 30k “YOLO” on GME. I purchased the 25c 4/16 with roughly 77 contracts. My cost basis was about 5 dollars a contract since I bought before earnings. I diamond handed them through the rough days where we saw GME drop heavy after earnings.

Two nights before GME took off, I sold my position. I keep going back, and I keep asking myself. Why? Why did I sell? I was so confident this would play out. I Fucking went all in and sat on my position through all of the ups and downs. Truth is, I don’t know why I sold. I believe I was bored, and just wanted to trade something. I couldn’t stand not trading. 

When the run up began, I felt sick. I threw up, and my body wouldn’t stop shaking. Life changing money for me. I kept checking the value of the contracts that I had, every 15 minutes and counting all the money I would’ve had if I didn’t throw my contracts away.

I began shaking and crying. Hating myself for being such a paper handed bitch. So I went all in again on a GME weekly. I watched that weekly call double my original position, and then eventually ride to 0. That’s right. 

I blew up my account. I’ve only been trading options for less than a year but at the top of GMEs run my position would’ve been roughly 4mil.  

I’ve gone from 20k -> 60k -> 3k -> 20k -> 36k -> 0

Everyone including friends and family keep asking if I’ve heard about GME. Yeah bitch, I heard about it. It hurts to talk about. I tell my story, and they all tell me how sorry they feel for me when I tell them I could’ve been a multi millionaire.

Do you want to know why I don’t have millions right now? Because of these mother fucking paper hands. 

As I watch you retards gamble your life savings at the top of GME, diamond handing it to the bottom, I can’t help but to think that you guys are fucking retarded. 

You’re all retarded but you’re like me. You belong here, and I certainly belong here. 

As we speak, I’m pulling funds out of the retirement account and going back at it. 

Why? Is it because I’m a Retard? Maybe. But I’m a Retard with a dream, and that can be scary thing and I realize that.

Godspeed to you all.

All jokes aside, this shit did happen. It sucks, but it did happen. You need to forgive yourself for being a retard and take a break from trading. There are a LOT of people regretting not buying when they first saw DFV's post, or when they bought early and sold even earlier. You are not alone. Shit happens and a lot of it is chance circumstance and split second decision making that we don't give as much thought to as we should. The numbers on our screen can definitely feel fake and fun, but it's legitimate money and we're dealing with life changing amounts of capital, both in a good and bad way. 

You're down bad right now, but take a few minutes to be thankful for what you do have. If you don't have extra money, at least you have health, if you don't have health, at least you have loved ones, if you don't have that at least you have the ability to be conscious and think.

No one could have called the day gme would take off, and if it had mooned 6 months later it wouldn't bother you nearly as much. Its just unfortunate timing.

Rack your brain. What’s going to be a huge industry in the coming years that you can get in on the ground floor? Something you can buy a bunch of shares in? Why not smoke some weed to help you think? Great Scott. Of course. The solution is right there in front of you, sandwiched between a sweating Jack In The Box cup and a broken iPad used to roll joints on. You’ll invest in weed stocks. Everyone likes weed and Joe Biden is going to legalize it soon! Look at that, you can buy weed stocks for CHEAP! $SNDL is barely more than a dollar share. With $80 you’re practically a majority shareholder!

You couldn’t be more wrong.

I could throw a bunch of complicated DD at you right now with charts and acronyms so we could both pretend we’re smart. But it really isn’t complicated. If weed stocks are going to surge due to legalization then someone explain why when weed is legalized in certain states the price of an ounce can plummet to $60? You’re talking about a commodity literally ANYONE can grow in their home. It’s as if climate scientists expect that rain will turn to beer within the month and you say “I’ll invest in Budweiser!”

I can feel you getting defensive and I understand. Won’t some company end up being the biggest out of them all and worth a lot of money? What about peripheral industries like Akerna? Wait, Screech died? When?

Over-saturation is going to be the biggest thing with legalized weed (See: $60 ounce). Supply side will be local or at largest, regional. If I’m in Seattle why am I ordering weed and paying shipping costs from North Carolina? Or even worse getting it from Canada with all the international trade headaches? There is literally nothing they can offer me that can’t be grown or produced locally. Nor is this like the wine industry where climate conditions can influence the product. I can grow this anywhere. Which also means there is still a massive black market for weed.

When I say black market I don’t mean guys with face scars meeting in empty airplane hangars to make deals. I mean your friend decided to throw some seeds in the ground, forgot about them and now has 4 pounds of weed he needs to get rid of. Being from a legal state I cannot tell you how much free weed I get from friends. It’s like when you think you’re cooking a reasonable amount of spaghetti and next thing you know you’re the gluttony scene in “Se7en”.

So what about peripheral businesses surrounding pot? I’ve seen a lot of talk about Akerna ($KERN) on here. Mostly people saying they’re the “only business of their kind in an emerging market”, etc. So have a look at their description on the website:

>Akerna consolidates cannabis technology companies to connect data points in the global cannabis supply chain. In doing so, Akerna creates one of the world’s most transparent and accountable consumer packaged goods supply chains on a global scale. We believe connected data and information will modernize and propel the cannabis industry by increasing the power of businesses, governments, patients, and consumers to make smart decisions.

This reads like an essay with a minimum word count.

Just because something is the only business of its kind isn’t a good reason it will succeed. Go find the cardboard box the guy who invented toe socks lives in and he’ll tell you. If my supply side is mostly local what the fuck am I going to do with the information Akerna provides? They are a cannabis software company. A cannabis software company. Keep saying it. A cannabis software company.

555,Help me understand AMC,"So in the 8-k filed on January 25th, AMC said the Silverlake would get 44 million shares from converting their senior note.  Silverlake dumped those 44 million shares between $13 to $16/share...smart move for them bad for AMC shares holders.  In that 8k AMC also said they would issue 50 million new shares, to be sold ...whenever. I'm seeing reports that they sold at least some of them in the $10+ range.  So the question i have is two fold:

1. I see all these people posting short interest %...how do they actually know if AMC can randomly sell new shares?

2. Why are people bullish on AMC with all of the dilution? They have sold new shares multiple times since October.  The price should be less than $2 if you just look at dilution.

Edit: love all of the thoughtful answers. Not sure why so many downvoted for asking questions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le3az6/help_me_understand_amc/,"Look at market cap and earnings (it's currently heavily undervalued), everything else is loud noise which means price movement (up or down nobody knows).  But to me if I were to bet I think AMC looks like a falling wedge (bullish price confirmation at the peaks and strong valleys narrowing signifing a dispute of price with decreasing volume over time).  Hollywood postponed a lot of movie releases and people have been deprived and told to stay home.  Which means pent up demand, so if this thing breaks out it could be huge.  If not you have a smart long position at this point. You can only lose on short term if your not patient.Movie theaters is a post pandemic play that hasn’t run yet.AMC isn’t going out of business anymore and vaccine rollout is picking up.

Hollywood is waiting as long as possible to release its movies.

It’ll be a bukakke of movies once they open doors. Might as well buy in while shares are cheap as dirt.

This isn’t a 2 day squeeze play. It’s a 2-6 month boom.Movie theaters are something I miss and look forward to going to again. This is why I bought the stock. If I feel this way than many more do.

Must watch....I'll be averaging down my AMCEz money, buy the dipBefore all the hype and links to WSB, I saw AMC as a great buy and saw it making a run to $10 when it was $2.10 a share. I thought the short squeeze would bring it to $6. Pullback, consolidate, and make a slow move up to $10 by the end of 2021. A lot of youtubers (stock moe, etc) have been buying up airlines, cruises, and other leisure stocks because there is such a huge demand ready to burst after the vaccine.Amc is going to survive now but the dilution is large. You have to add 700 cash then add 44m shares and see where it’s at. The company also sold some shares and add those too. Basically it’s a giant block of cash now.There is no reason to be bullish. Unless you are bagholding and want it to go up. Seems like most on here buy late. Gme. Pltr. AMC. Then try to convince people to hype it to drop bagsSelling shares at $10 is good for the stock... the cash they get makes the company more valuable and offsets dilution. 

Example: Company X has 1 share outstanding, $5 in cash, no debt, no operations, fair price per share is $5.  Let’s say they sell 1 share for $10.  Now you have 2 shares, $15 cash, no debt, no operations, company is now worth $7.5/share",1612635582.0,58

558,How I think AMC is not worth $1,"*I'm not a financial advisor; I'm just a regular investor who likes stocks. Do your due diligence before purchasing stock, and make sure you invest what you can afford to throw away without feeling guilty about it.*

Hi everyone, hope you're having a peaceful Saturday. The Super Bowl is coming up, so I hope you guys in America enjoy it.

This post is for AMC, as this is what I've been playing close attention to. After doing some of my own research, I've concluded that AMC isn't worth $1 as many analysts have mentioned in their analysis, and I think it should be much higher. It all comes down to the fundamentals of the film industry.

How film studios and distributors make money is primarily based on theatre attendances. Usually, a portion of profits made from theatre tickets goes to theatre owners. The majority of the rest goes to the studio and distributor. The amount is organised through a contract between the exhibitor and the studio before the film is aired; usually, it's a 60/40 split, with 60% of the ticket revenue going to the studio. You can read more about how movies make money here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/093015/how-exactly-do-movies-make-money.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/093015/how-exactly-do-movies-make-money.asp)

As long as this fundamental is in place, the film studios and distributors will keep airing their films in theatres and cinemas. Although streaming services are the future of entertainment, they won't be able to replicate the same big-screen experience that many do enjoy. Furthermore, they won't provide the same profit margins for film studios as a regular theatre would do. It all boils down to the streaming service business model.

A prime example of this is when Disney aired the live-action film Mulan on Disney+. You had to pay the $30 early-access fee on top of the regular $6.99 per month subscription to get into Disney+. Logically, there was a big backlash behind this move, with many calling it a ""daylight robbery"". This defeats the purpose of a streaming subscription business model; the whole point is that you pay a small fee per month to gain access to a large amount of content. Having a rental that costs more than a regular rental and even more than a regular ticket, is counterintuitive to the business model.

Now take the fundamentals of the film industry into account, and it doesn't add up. If the streaming platform sets a $20-30 fee on a film, no one pays to watch it. If they set no fees at all, then the film studio won't make their money back.

So, as long as this fundamental is in place, AMC will continue making money in the future. AMC has set up private theatre rentals, screening old classics and airing new films from 2021 into 2022. And as long as big film studios advertise people to watch their movies in theatres, AMC will go on.

Now that bankruptcy is off the table, and vaccinations are ramping up, we'll slowly return to normal. I can see the stock being back to $10-20 again.

**TL;DR:** As long as film studios advertise to go to the theatres, AMC won't go anywhere.

*Again, I'm not a financial advisor; I'm just a regular investor who likes stocks. Do your due diligence before purchasing stock, and make sure you invest what you can afford to throw away without feeling guilty about it.*

Thanks for reading.

**Edit:** u/ActuaryExpert8729 commented on something that adds more to the argument that AMC will do fine. The COVID-19 Relief Package signed in December 2020 sets aside $15 billion of financial support to movie theatres and live event venues. There's probably a fund for film studios as well. Films are already moving up ahead of schedule, with Godzilla vs Kong moved from May 21st to March 26th.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le38b6/how_i_think_amc_is_not_worth_1/,"People also think that cinemas are going to go away the same as Blockbuster or RadioShack, the difference is that you can't replace a cinema unless you own your own.

Small screens and VR can't compare to the video and audio quality. It is also a good excuse to get out of the house.

I like the stock, I got 20 of them but not to sell, just to invest in things I believe in and love.What the hell is the TLDR? I see $20 in this essay so TO THE MOON!!!

EDIT: The fact they payed down debt makes me not regret buying this stock. May take a year or so but It'll be $20+ by EOY IMOTotally agree on the analysis (haven't done the math on the numbers, but the reasoning makes tital sense).

Saying cinema are dead iaime restaurants and bars to because yoy cab di take out.

It's about the experience, getting out of the house with friends, slises, or dates.

Thinking at my teen daughter, its way more fun to get out with her friends, grab a mod pizza, then go to the movies together (and for the >16-18-19-21, depending on the country, maybe grab a drink or two after) than to do this at home with us, their parents, around.Worth $20 imoI got in low enough that I’m just gonna hold some shares and keep selling some covered callshttps://youtu.be/jQmhX7qpQrc

Watch, definitely make you feel better about AMC...I know I do and will be averaging down Monday!!Amc is with more than $1 in cash now alone. But yes I agree it’s an okay asset now.Look at CGX. It’s canandian movie theatre. AMC is all over America. Should be double or triple current price atm.I love this post, and I'm long on AMC. 50+ shares at 2.25. I think there are three key points to add:

- box office earnings on direct to streaming releases are awful/studios will prioritize theatrical again as soon as they possibly can without killing people(ww1984 did a tenth of what it would've done in a theatrical release, even though it sucked: https://screenrant.com/wonder-woman-1984-poor-box-office-performance/)
- moviepass style subscription model launched in 2019, right before value peaked at 20 pre pandemic. Yes I'm a moron and my brain is smooth but theatres kill on snack margins, and more affordable trips means more snacks + profits even when you see no movies that month.
- two summer blockbuster seasons within 8 months. All summer releases held prior to pandemic popping in oct/nov, when it would usually be oscar season for low ish budget with modest returns, plus a typical summer blockbuster season starting with multiple marvel movies will crush earnings.

Two biggest gambles heading in when I got in were bankruptcy (now looks to be avoidable as pointed out above) and a fucked up vaccine rollout which might actually still curb that first blockbuster window heading into holidays 2021, but could just also swing the opposite way and open up a window for major releases in Sept.  

Also ""people won't go to the movies it's not safe?"" Bruh they're risking death for broccoli cheddar soup at Panera I think they'll run the risk for Bond 26. Agree on eventual value settling between $10-$20.Only if you are prepared to long $AMC. And you already know all these new people here in r/wsb are trying to get rich quick. But seriously at that point it’s other stocks around that price point I’d rather hold. Carnival, any of the airlines, Uber, jack in box, or any of the retail banks. $AMC will still have split the movie market with Cinemark and whoever else.

569,"PSA: If you're thinking about buying travel stocks during the current off-season, know what to look for","Travel industry stock is already starting to recover from all-time lows.

However, January/February is historically the slowest travel period of the year. Stock prices for airlines and hotel services are already low due to:

(COVID-19 travel restrictions) + (Low Travel Time of Year) = Low Share Price

***HOWEVER*** Please know that some airlines and hotel services took on A TON of debt that will take a long time to recover from. Others relied on large cash reserves to make it through the pandemic and took on minimal debt.

The ones that borrowed the least amount of money from the government over the pandemic will be the ones with the largest and quickest bounce back when this summer's travel season hits with lifted COVID travel restrictions and the urge for people to want to get out of the house.

Minimal debt will make it easier for these well-off travel companies to be able to meet the sudden increase in demand this summer and get themselves back to pre-covid financial stability relatively quick.

The ones that accrued a ton of loan-debt will be the ones that you won't see much gain from for *YEARS* as cash reserves are *slowly* built back up.

***The Main Point***: If you are interested in investing in travel companies during the current off-season of travel, ***DO YOUR RESEARCH*** to find the ones that have the strongest financial strong-hold when the travel season hits.

Take a walk, watch a movie. Maybe try recouping your losses with index investing, or something safer to get your mind off the market.

(It's a mix of 2 accounts, so I posted trades on gme from the bigger one, I also traded BB options and stonks in this time)

Posting on my alt, since a few people know my legit account and between money and mental health issues, it's just easier to avoid. 

But I've lurked for at least 4 years, but hadn't post in a while. 

So, here I am, divorced 2 years, young kid, awful depression & very suicidal, seeing a shrink twice a week who threatened to institutionalize me, and I'm newly medicated. (So I'm in bad shape, but doing what I need to for help) 

My start up was already hurting, and tanked from covid, ex is trying to take kid to far away land. Dwindling savings which means I need a shitty, damned near free lawyer to not lose my kid. Late December get a letter from previous employer that they are gonna mess with a 401k l didn't move. Decide to move it. Due to a bunch of paperwork issues it took a while for the account to be funded. 

18.5k mostly yoloed into GME options while half drunk on the couch of the woman I've been with on again off again since divorced. Knew how stupid this was because was a broker in 2008 when everything went to shit. I know enough to be dangerous, but in many ways clueless. Never actually did an option before. 

What have got to lose? I mean I'm literally shopping for drugs to off myself every few nights. (Nembutal is realy hard to find) Ex gets 2nd interview in far away land. If lose my kid I'm 100% fucked mentally. Day after she tells me this account hits 100k. Was in bed with my quasi-girlfriend, and she saw the intraday high as double her annual salary. 

Feeling weird anxiety all weekend. Wednesday account hits 250k, decide to take the options off the table and keep the majority of shares since this is enough for me to live at least 2 years and still have lawyer money. So, maybe this shit saved me from myself.


A bit of an epilogue:  took out a chunk, got a good lawyer, lawyer said there is little chance for me to lose my kid, and I'm in good shape. So yeah, this isn't a sad story, just needed to give context for how this lambo money is going to something way the fuck better than a lambo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le2fwy/my_gme_gain_porn_28k_247k/,"Congrats

580,EV batteries vs EV component mining,"
I saw something then I heard more and it that got me thinking and wanted some thoughts on it. With a huge wave of coming demand I wanted to look for opportunities in the periphery of EV’s.

So I have seen some articles and the talking heads have spoken about a coming EV battery shortage. There really don’t seem to be many EV battery producers. Tesla is a big one and they’re bringing in house. Lg is another (they are making batteries for Tesla).  

There is lots of talk about recycling batteries. Tesla says they plan to. There is also opportunities to use the battery after its life in the car. I don’t see any companies that are focused on this.

There is an ETF $LIT. I’m not thrilled with it though.

So my thoughts lead me to EV battery material mining. With shortages this could be a good play but I’m not sure about long term potential.

So anyone have any ideas?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le2dcq/ev_batteries_vs_ev_component_mining/,"$ValeMicrovast?  Edit.  Sorry, you asked for mining companies.

I'm considering investing in nickel since that commodity price should be poised for long term growth over lithium.  If Tesla is successful in their lithium extraction method, then lithium prices would be less likely to increase due to availability of lithium.I actually really like the etf lit. It's returns have been very good and being an etf minimizes risk. But also limits rewards. A good starting point could be to look at LIT'S holdings and just pick something from there that you like.Honestly I was looking into the same thing especially with the new batterys coming out that allow you to charge them in the same amount of time it would take to fill up a cars gas tank.

GME on this sub even a week ago was a populist disorganized movement against organized corrupt capital, or that's how the overwhelming majority of comments saw it. 

With no deadline on the time in which they have to cover their shorts and pay back loans (in the case of melvin 20+% on a 2.3 billion loan) , it’s a game of chicken. For every day they don’t cover, they stand to lose a lot of money, and they are BLEEDING. They are using mimetic warfare to get you to lose confidence.

590,GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze,"DISCLAIMER: This post is NOT Financial Advice!  
   
  
This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets
  
  
[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

Yet this past week I’ve seen nothing but increasing positions, hold or nothing,💎👋, and of course non stop conspiracies followed by loss porn that’s not even fun to watch. The real concerning thing is that I’ve seen a lot of posts claiming to be first time investors, dumping their small life savings into GME. My question is why? Is it just FOMO, like you still believe the squeeze hasn’t happened yet. Is it denial? Why not just except your losses and put whatever money you have left in the countless other winning bets?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1zt5/to_everyone_that_been_holding_gme_this_past_week/,"Sir, this is a casinoHe just wants your 💎.

Your wife doesn't have a boyfriend, that's just a conspiracy theory.GME is a long for me at this point. With new exec positions being filled and being down a couple grand anyway (it’s money I fully expected to lose, I didn’t go full retard and bet life savings), I actually have a positive outlook on the company. While I’m probably not going to make back the money I lost during the frenzy, this me now actually believing in the stock and investing. Should I cut my losses? Yeah probably, but I think GameStop under new management can actually turn the dying company around. There was something also about having a deal with Microsoft on working out an online storefront as well. I may sell in the future still at a loss if my outlook changes but the shares are here to stay.Nice try palMade a shit ton of money on TLRY this and last week and it’s gonna keep going lolJust ask this in the daily thread. You don't have to make a fucking post to boost your ego. Now all i see lately is gme hate. You are doing exactly what you don't want people to do.Because the vast majority of GME holders believe in the company and its new leadership. GameStop is not some shut company nobody cares about. It’s the number one brand in gaming and it’s being led by a guy who is taking his world class e-commerce infrastructure and applying it to the gaming world. If he can do it with dog food as the product, he can do it with gaming. It’s like a person who can sing the phone book and make it sound amazing. The words (product) are secondary.

GameStop brand + Cohen’s leadership = home run play. 

Not to mention the brand has become a worldwide symbol for fighting against a rigged system. You couldn’t ask for a better scenario. Avoid GME at your own risk. Once the shorts are out and the dust settles, this stock will be climbing for quite some time.Well I partially want to keep game stop in business.

(Not you OP, just in general)Twitter was, is, and always will be the problem. As soon as they got involved, bad things happened. 

According to twitterers, AMC was supposed to go to the moon last week. Then it was “hold until Friday, if we close above 9 dollars, we’re going to the moon Monday.” Then when AMC did diddly on Monday, it was wait until tomorrow. Tuesday was a Green Day but it went up to like 9.50 at most. So then the “hold till Thursday because the options expire and we’re going to the moon.” Then it closed lower than it has in a long time.

Imagine the average investor who would’ve helped drive this being promised money for two weeks and not getting anything. Then the people that promised them money calling them a pussy and “paper hands” when they stop believing it’s going anywhere. As the great George W. Bush said... fool me once... sh... shame on you. Fool me-can’t get fooled again. I don’t think we would’ve had trouble getting people to hold if we didn’t have the Twitter Warren Buffet’s on the world telling them they’d be rich tomorrow and spreading so much misinformation... just my two cents.I agree, anyone still holding GME, go for it. I hope it rockets up to 1k+ and I still have 8 shares in it. The problem is with people not letting anyone else discuss anything that isn’t GME.

596,$RIDE or die,"  

Listen up, I’m about to hand you undeserving miscreants a 5-bagger, maybe 10, just by buying and holding.

[Lordstown Motors](https://lordstownmotors.com/) ($RIDE), makers of the [Endurance](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance), the only EV truck with four independent, hub-mounted motors.

**The Company** 

Lordstown Motors is named after Lordstown, Ohio, site of a giant [mothballed GM factory](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/06/gms-lordstown-factory-goes-dark-as-automaker-closes-underused-plants.html). The factory spit out 16 million cars and trucks before being shut down two years ago. Car manufacturing was what Lordstown was built around, but people stopped buying sedans, and this factory only made the Chevy Cruze. You know anyone who drives a Cruze? Exactly. No one. That’s why they shut down.

But you know what people want? TRUCKS. You know what else people are buying? Electric vehicles. Too bad there are only those ridiculously ugly Cybertrucks that will someday, maybe, eventually, get built and sold at ridiculous prices. Too bad there’s only that hydrogen one that runs on MS Paint and vaporware. Too bad the other EVs are Chinese, so when you retards lick the windows, you get cancer.

Meanwhile, there are entire fleets of commercial vehicles looking for something to fill their needs. And you know who knows how to build all of that? A bunch of fucking unemployed people in Lordstown, Ohio! Enter RIDE. They made a deal with GM to buy the plant and get prototypes for fleet vehicles rolling off the line within a year. 

**The Truck**

My God, look at this beautiful beast. Look at those sexy headlamps. Look at those MFing solenoid coils in the wheel wells. Those taillights look like Cyclops and Geordi La Forge had an LED love child. Wanna touch it. Makes me hard.

75 MPGe. 7,000 lb towing capacity. 1.5 ton payload. 250 mile range. 109 kWh battery pack. Unnnggghh. Read it to me again, but slower. Aaahhh yeah.

Most important differentiator? The hub motors. They’re directly on the wheel, so there’s no transmission devices of any sort, so no wasted motion, no wasted energy. They’re designed specifically for the type of stop-start driving that fleet vehicles do. Think package delivery. And because they’re independent motors, they can individually deliver power, allowing true 4WD on muddy job sites, not the actually-its-just-2-axle design.

OK class, can anyone name a group of [aging delivery vehicles that might need to be replaced real soon](https://www.wired.com/story/biden-wants-government-run-evs-not-easy/)? Preferably from [an American manufacturer](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/25/president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-strengthening-buy-american-provisions-ensuring-future-of-america-is-made-in-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/)? Can you say “[regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture)”? I know you can!

Who’s making the parts, you ask? GM. RIDE has full access to the GM catalogue of parts, so the company can just copy and paste the behind-the-dashboard stuff with confidence that it’ll work, that suppliers will come through, that costs will be reasonable due to bulk production in other GM vehicles, and most importantly, that the company doesn’t need to pay for the R&D. It’s already been done. RIDE is reinventing the wheel, but the rest of the truck is taken care of. Like your wife, it’s got that label on the outside, but it’s really someone else’s junk in her.

Who’s making the batteries, though? Samsung. Nuff said. And the motors? [These guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbbCuwC_UwE).

**The Money**

Cool truck. Fine. Whatever. Can’t eat a truck, only tendies. So look at the numbers. The truck will sell for between MSRP of $52500 and an actual price of $45,000. Let’s take the lesser. It costs, the company estimates, $42k today and $37k by 2024. The plant will ramp up from just a few thousand this year to 100,000 by 2024. From there, the plant can produce 600,000 trucks per year. Dayum! That’s a lot of product! Isn’t that way more than anyone could sell? 

No, retard. Look it up. The Ford F150 sells 900,000 trucks every year. The Silverado, about 600k. Nobody’s buying those boomer dinosaurs. 100k is nothing. It’s easy, especially when you’re the most badass EV truck available, and unlike the competitors, you actually exist in real life.

So let’s pencil in 100k trucks per year, sold at 45k and costing 37k. Let’s say it’s $130 million to run the G&A. That’s…$726k in profit by 2024, more every year after. Look, I understand most of you just want to SEC (middle word = Elon’s) all day long, so you don’t really understand the concept of profit yet, but trust me, it’s a good thing!

Right now the company has a market cap of $4 billion. It can make ¾ billion in a year. That’s a P/E of 5. What’s Ford’s PE right now? 10. If RIDE gets to the same PE (and it will go much higher because it’s not a boomer truck) it’ll double. If RIDE sells as well as the Silverado sells now, the PT is $222 at a minimum. That’s 10 times today’s price. In 5-6 years.

You’re welcome.

597,A Tale of Two Stocks,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.

Thanks to industrialization, large portions of the population were uprooted and were herded together in large centers. This new form of existence, with its mass psychology and social dependence on the fluctuation of markets and wages, produced an individual who was unstable, insecure, and suggestible. He was aware that his life depended on boards of directors and captains of industry, and he supposed, rightly or wrongly, that they were chiefly motivated by financial interests. He knew that, no matter how conscientiously he worked, he could still fall a victim at any moment to economic changes which were utterly beyond his control. And there was nothing else for him to rely on.

The captains of industry, most of them in the United States, chiefly motivated by financial interests, did indeed infect the entire planet with their greedy materialism. One concomitant of such materialism is the spiritual confusion of our modern world. Another has been the hollowing out of money, which in the near future will make all savings illusory. A third is the emptiness of Western materialistic values, which has led to the degeneration of the individual personality. 

Success doesn’t mean the gaining of wealth, position, or other advantage, implying things like advancement, upward mobility, getting or being rich, having power or status, achieving a prominent social position, or gaining acclaim or a respected reputation in one’s career. 

The new success is people taking up their individual responsibility, accepting the challenge of personal change, achieving transformation, turning problems into opportunities, moving into their own power, working with those less fortunate, developing visions to inspire and energize others, and challenging the status quo.

When the time is fulfilled a new orientation will irresistibly break through, a thing unheard-of before: the right man sitting in his house and thinking the right thought will be heard 100 miles away. Neither propaganda nor exhibitionist confessions are needed.

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think the commission-free stock trading & investing apps are a pretty neat idea.

598,Everyone 💎 🤚 for $1000 and why we should be hoping for 3:1 x$100 instead,"Think about this. Bulls and bears squabbling back and forth. HF’s dealing with massive potential losses willing to potentially taking legally questionable actions. Retail investors losing big gains and getting tin foil hat sick. GME’s market cap roller coaster making company moves difficult to plan. 

If GME split shares 3:1, it could solve a lot of the problems for all sides. 

1. Retail investors. Let’s say you bought in at $300 and now we’re down to $60. If a split occurred, your share would turn to three valued at $20. Demand surges from HF’s to help cover their shorts as well as 📄 🤚/new retail investors sending the stock back to $100. Your one share losing $240 is now 3 shares worth your initial investment. Also allows people to average down. For those average share under $300 currently, gains. 

2. HF’s. If HF’s are short, they can grab a good chunk of shares to cover ~1/3 of their short position at a discount. The HF’s shorting at $400 currently would only need new shares to stay under $133 to cover. Stabilizes the beasts by their direct surge in buying the lower value shares to bring value up, positively impacting retail investors. Nothing will change some folk’s sentiment about HF’s, but it would be at least a more legal way for them to play their games while not borking the retail investor like they have been. 

3. GME. The roller coaster stock prices/market cap make planning for investments/pivots by the new leadership difficult to calculate. By splitting and seeing a surge to find a common ground, in this scenario, GME’s market cap would be $21B. A lot for a “failing” game store (HF thesis for shorting) and to pivot for massive company evolution (bull retail investors/“I like the stock” crowd). 

Ie. I have 100 shares. If it meme’d out and got to $1000 each, who’s to say the brokerages could universally (looking at you RH) pay out for people who dip out at $1000?  My 100 shares I bought close to the top ($300 for $30k) would then become 300 shares at $100, bringing me back even on investment but now in possession of a valuable asset I could choose to sell. GME has a stockpile of cash from these adjustments to make major moves in the market. If I hold my now recovered $30k, GME could go up based on new initiatives (especially after all this free publicity). If I don’t really love the stock, I can get out and get my money back. For those who averaged below $300 a share or hold shares from the before times, you end up with some pretty significant - and stable - gains with 3x as many shares in a company poised for a massive pivot. 

Not a pessimist, 💎 🤚 all the way. But, if I could triple my stake in a company I believe in and see my initial investment get back to close to even, watching GME have the capital to make some gigantic leaps at the expense of the HF’s fixing their mess by jacking up the new diluted share price, I wouldn’t exactly be mad. Plus new investors/people finally able to average down would see gains. That looks to me like 3 parties (current holders, GME and new retail investors) winning at the expense of HF’s fixing their garbage hands while jacking the price for shareholders.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1qyd/everyone_for_1000_and_why_we_should_be_hoping_for/,"🤣🤣🤣

There literally wouldn't be any ""additional"" shares on a 3:1 stock split. Everybody that's already holding shares, would have 3x in volume but the same proportion relative to the market. If there are counterfeit shares, those would have to be subject to split also. 

In your example, ($60 stock price, 3:1 split going from $20/share to $100) the HFs would be fucked 5x on a short @ 60.

If you're talking about issuing additional shares, that would be bad also, diluting the value of shares currently held in the market.

599,Consider a pre-earnings LULU bet,"[LULU](https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/) is the place where all (basic) girls go to get their amazing $150 yoga pants (and other high-quality yet overpriced apparel) after getting their frappuccino at Starbucks! They have menswear too which has been gaining popularity.

Someone recently did [a great DD on LULU](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/klxhx6/lulu_to_the_moon_and_here_is_why/). I want to add a few things:

\- The stock price has been struggling in the past 3 months (down 5%) but has started an upward trend last week.

\- Q4 earnings coming out on 3/25, and given how busy the stores were during the holidays can bet it's going to be awesome.

\- Currently, the most popular (highest open interest) option for this stock (across all expiration dates and strikes) is 380C 3/19/2021, so it seems smart money is betting on a big move prior to the earnings (although it's possible these positions were opened mid last year when the stock price was higher.)

Otherwise, the average person on here probably wouldve just paid off rent for a year or two? Or two nice vacations from the potential earnings had they sold @ 450$. I quite frankly dont give a fuck about the 5 digit missed profits or unrealized losses, I can make it back in half a year tops if Im lazy. Technically, I didnt lose anything yet as I plan to hold my shares @ average of 40 to the grave or give them to my great great children but you get my point.

It wasnt my first degenerate gamble and the logic and maths were there. It was a once-in-a-lifetime play. What grinds my gears though was when momentum was totally cut off last week and shit started crashing when no one could buy. We were on track to soar but we didn't count on brokers taking a piss. It blows.

I'm OK losing money I was willing to gamble. I have no problem sinking with the ship at this point, but not in an unfair game. Imagine sitting at a blackjack table and the dealer busts just for him to take a card off and say 'Oh yeah, I changed the rules. I unbusted! Hooha!!' What I'm upset about is that they had to bend the rules to beat us. We were on track to hit 1000$ per share had RH and other fuck faces not halted all ability to buy GME. What ever happened to a free market and land of the free?

My second disappointment isnt with the system, its in myself. Many moons ago, I used to work 9$ an hour scanning pineapples and bananas as a kid. Soon after college I worked a construction job for 15$ an hour till I found a more stable job with my college degree. I bought my shares @ 40$, I couldve sold each for 200,300, or even 400 easy. What happened? I got greedy.  Lets be honest with ourselves, most of us did the same shit. Everytime I hit the refresh button I was printing 2K and imagined ruling the world from a yacht in the Hvar with my GME shares. I was too fucking high off benjamin franklins to sell each share for 5-10X what I bought them for that I phoned my broker and set each share at 10,000$. The kid that used to buy freezies from the 7/11 for 0,50$ and dove a 500$ rust bucket to and fro college was setting each share for 10,000$ a share cause his head was too far up his arse, somewhere on the outskirts of Andromeda.

603,"The ""Gamma Squeeze"" Explained: Gamma Theory for Monke","Since GME's gamma squeeze 2 weeks ago, every monkey seems to think that GME is primed for another ""gamma squeeze"" every single day. Veteran WSBers almost certainly understand what a gamma squeeze is because a) It's not complicated b) Gamma was all the rage last March as SPY plunged into oblivion...but the 6M monkeys that have flooded into these sacred gates within the last 2 weeks seem to be pretty oblivious. So, I want to help spread some knowledge so our community isn't filled with fucking idiots. **I'm going to try to explain some basic gamma theory, diluted-down so even you peanut-brain baboons can understand.** *You do have to be literate to understand this, so maybe there is no hope for many of you.*

You need to have a basic understanding of *options greeks*, namely delta and gamma. I will briefly discuss them so we're all on the same page, but I'm not going in-depth because there are hundreds of posts in this sub explaining them in-depth, not to mention all the boring bullshit that gets posted in places like r/options.

EDIT: Putting this at the top since apparently many people are confused. **A ""gamma squeeze"" has absolutely nothing to do with a short squeeze**. Gamma squeezes are driven by large numbers of OTM option buying, whereas short squeezes have to do with short hedge funds buying back shares to cover their ass. *A short squeeze can happen without a gamma squeeze, and a gamma squeeze can happen without a short squeeze.*

DISCLAIMER: *I have no idea what I'm talking about. This has nothing to do with my career and I've learned all of this gamma shit from reading tons of shit online. This is not a lot things, and it's definitely not financial advice.  There are probably tens-of-thousands of people in this sub that know way more about this than me, so if I say something incorrect, I will happily edit this to reflect that.*

*If you understand basics options greeks, skip ahead.*

For the following, assume you paid $100 ($1.00 per share) to buy-to-open 1 call contract with strike price $10 (I'll refer to this as $10C). You are now ""long"" this $10C. If you sell an option, you are ""short"" it. Each option contract is worth 100 shares, so you multiply delta/gamma by 100 to get net delta/gamma.

* **Delta**: *For every $1 move in the underlying, your option's price/value will change by delta.*
   * For example: If your delta is 0.25 (or 25, same thing), then the value of your option will increase by $0.25 for each $1 the underlying increase. I.e. Stock goes from $5 to $6, then your $1.00/share call increases to $1.25/share, netting you a profit of $25. Stock goes from $5 to $4, then your call decreases to $0.75/share, netting you a loss of $25.
   * Long calls are positive (+) delta, short calls are negative (-) delta; long puts are (-) delta, short puts are (+) delta. Delta gets larger in magnitude as you go in-the-money (ITM) and smaller as you go out-of-the-money (OTM).
      * At-the-money options (ATM) have a delta of approximately 0.50. The delta of deep ITM options approaches 1.0 as you go further into the money. The delta of deep OTM options approaches 0.0 as you go further out of the money.
* **Gamma:** *For every $1 move in the underlying, your* ***delta*** *will change by* ***gamma.***
   * If you have taken any basic physics course, this will sound like **acceleration** to you...because it basically is. It's the 2nd order derivative of your option's value function.
   * If you have no idea what any of the above means, think about **gamma as the gas pedal in your wife's boyfriend's car**: when he floors the gas pedal, the car goes faster and faster, increasing in speed *exponentially*. Once the car starts moving, it starts picking up speed rapidly because of the acceleration, and you go flying into the back of the trunk as your wife gives her boyfriend a quick handie in the front seat.
   * Long options all have positive (+) gamma, regardless if they're a put or a call; **short options all have negative (-) gamma**. **Gamma is largest at-the-money** (ATM) and decreases as you move both ITM and OTM.
   * For example: Delta is 0.25, gamma is 0.05, underlying price is $7. As price goes from $7 to $8 (approaching your $10 strike), delta increases by gamma to 0.30 and gamma increases to 0.10. As price then goes from $8 to $9, delta increases to 0.40 and gamma increases to 0.15. As price increases from $9 to $10, delta increases to 0.55.

>***As gamma increases, delta grows exponentially***...and gamma increases because you are approaching the strike price. If that makes sense, then you basically understand how a gamma squeeze works.

Now before I explain what a gamma squeeze is, I need you to stop slobbering all over your keyboard- you're an ape, not a dog. Just because your wife's boyfriend disciplines you like a delinquent poodle doesn't make you one. You're a fucking ape, have some pride.

Okay anyway, I want to explain what **market makers** (**MMs**) are because most of you orangutans clearly don't understand them either.

**Market Makers**

>*When you buy an option, another degenerate isn't selling it to you- a market maker is*.

MMs are large banks/institutions that have special agreements with your broker (sometimes they are your broker) to go behind the scenes and fill trades, providing essential liquidity to the market so you can get fills on your faggy delights (FDs). MMs make money by A) getting paid by the broker to create liquidity B) Scraping margins on bid-ask spreads. That doesn't sound like a lot of money, but when you're filling millions of spreads those pennies add up fast.

Since MMs will basically take any trade and *make money regardless of how the trade goes*, they want to **hedge the trade so their risk is essentially 0**. To do this, they try to be ""**delta neutral**,"" meaning they want their net delta to be 0. If net delta is 0, when price goes up or down the value of the overall position/strategy doesn't change.

""*Hedging! I've heard a lot of people use that word when talking about gamma!*"" is what you're probably thinking. Congrats, you chimpanzee, you're sort of starting to connect the dots.

**MM hedging is what creates gamma squeezes.**

>*How do MM's hedge options?*

Let's go back to that $10C you bought for $1.00/share (delta 0.25, gamma 0.05). A MM was on the other end of that transaction: they sold-to-open (or ""wrote"") the $10C for $100. Now the **MM is short a $10C**, so they have ***negative delta*** **and** ***negative gamma;*** their net delta is -25 and their net gamma is -5. They want to be delta neutral, so they buy 25 shares of the underlying (every long share has a delta of 1.0) and ~~wallah~~ (edit: I'm stupid) voila! -25 + 25 = 0.

*But, what happens when price increases?* You add gamma to delta. Your delta increases to +30, and the MM's options delta decreases (becomes more negative) to -30 (-25 + -5 = -30).

>*Because MM's have negative gamma, their delta gets larger in size*. ***Negative gamma creates gamma squeezes.***

*Uh oh,* now the MM's net delta is -5 (-30 from the short call, +25 from the long stock)...so they re-hedge by buying 5 more shares bringing their net delta back to 0. That share buying can push price up, leading to a vicious cycle of buying/re-hedging.

**The Gamma Squeeze**!

>Everytime MM's adjust their hedge by buying more shares, that can potentially **further increase the price.** This means delta will increase, and force MM's to **buy even more shares to re-re-hedge**.

*""Gamma"" is in the name, so where does gamma come into play?* As the underlying approaches your strike  price, gamma increases in size. This means that delta increases exponentially. As a result, MM's increase the number of shares they buy each time: first 5 at a time, then 10, then 15 at a time. As price goes up, **MMs buy gamma** **to hedge their short call.** **As gamma gets larger, MMs hedge with more shares.** *Without gamma, the squeeze would fizzle out quickly.*

**The setup:**

>Gamma squeezes don't happen all the time. *You need the proper setup for a stock to get ""gamma squeezed.""* That setup involves **leverage** and **HUUUGE** (like the size of your wife's-boyfriend's-dong big) **AMOUNTS of deep OTM options**, two things every fucker here loves.

Let's say a stock is trading at $15. A few million idiots load up on cheap, deep OTM options at $30 and $50. These are stupid fucking options with deltas of basically 0, so MM's don't need to hedge them *initially*. In most cases, these will expire worthless. For whatever reason, the underlying's price starts picking up speed and starts approaching those strikes.

Now, all of a sudden **those worthless calls have a non-zero delta, and that delta is rapidly increasing by a further-increasing gamma.** All of a sudden, MM's start buying a bunch of shares to hedge and the *rate at which they buy is increasing with gamma*. This is all exacerbated by the fact that these FD's were so dirt cheap that **tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of contracts were purchased** by fucking brainlets.

So let's revisit 2 Friday's ago, January 22nd. GME opened around $40. The most OTM call strike was $60C with an open interest of 35k to start the day. By the end of the day, the volume at that strike was **180,000**. We can't always assume those are all buying-to-open, but looking back I think it's safe to say most of them were probably buying-to-open. Those options were **dirt cheap** at the start of the day because their delta was basically 0. By the end of the day, GME closed around $65 and all those $60C expired ITM, meaning a delta of 1.0.

>**MM's actively hedge during the day as price moves**, so that means they had to keep buying shares as price moved closer and closer to $60. Because of this, **gamma squeezes happen during market hours**.

Again, you can't assume that all 180,000 $60C contracts were bought-to-open, but let's be reasonable and say 100,000 were bought-to-open. *That's the equivalent of 10 million shares that were purchased by MM's during the day to hedge their short calls* (total volume for that day was 200M) *- and that's just for the $60C alone*. Thus, this was a textbook gamma squeeze that inevitably helped drive GME's 50% increase in price that day.

**Will the GME Gamma Squeeze repeat:**

>Now that you hopefully understand the basics of a gamma squeeze, I want to re-emphasize one point: *YOU NEED HUGE AMOUNTS OF DEEP OTM CALLS FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE.*

Why did we get a gamma squeeze on January 22nd? Because the $60C were **dirt-fucking-cheap** so degenerates could **leverage themselves to the tits with calls.** Thousands of calls could be bought for pennies - these calls are worthless until they're suddenly not, forcing MMs to rapidly hedge and yielding *the glorious gamma squeeze.*

What's different now? Implied volatility (IV) has been record-settingly high on GME options for the past week. Like 700-900%...values that were pretty much unthinkable until this event. That insane IV leads to options prices that get JACKED UP multiple times what they were before, especially at deep OTM strikes.

>***So those deep OTM options that fueled the first gamma squeeze are now multiple times more expensive, which leads to significantly decreased purchasing and thus cripples the prospects for a gamma squeeze.***

Are MM's inflating prices intentionally to prevent a squeeze? Sort of- it's rising IV that's raising the price, but that works in their favor because it stifles the chances of a gamma squeeze.

**Parting Thoughts**

1. A gamma squeeze almost undoubtedly contributed to GME's rise, but I think whales took over after the initial squeeze and kept pumping the price. Maybe some shorts covered somewhere in there too. I honestly have no idea, which is why I'm not touching GME - although I am rooting for you monkeys to become bajillionaires.
2. In my opinion, **GME is not currently setup for an upwards gamma squeeze because there is not enough deep OTM call buying.** When you compare recent volume with what happened 2 weeks ago, it becomes obvious we're no where near setup for a call gamma squeeze
3. HOWEVER; as IV continues to decrease, that will make OTM call options cheaper again. **I am not recommending you buy those deep OTM short-term call options because chances are they will expire worthless**. With that said, that kind of ape-strength-fueled OTM call buying is what fueled the first squeeze...and it can certainly happen again. Although I'm not betting on it.

**Some important notes**

* **MMs hedge constantly throughout the day** as delta/gamma change. The idea that options expiring ITM or OTM will lead to a gamma squeeze after hours is ridiculous because MMs are actively hedging into close. If your long call expires ITM, the MM is already long the 100 shares by market close. This is why **gamma squeezes happen during market hours**.
   * The exceptions are when ATM options expire with non-zero deltas at expiration. In those cases, there is stock tied to those options at expiration and that stock will most likely be unwound in afterhours. This is probably not what happened with GME.
* Gamma squeezes can go **up or down**. Many of you seem to think that gamma squeezes only go up, but this is just wrong. **Squeezes follow the negative gamma** (MMs have negative gamma when you buy an option). If there's a lot of deep OTM call buying, that sets up for an upwards gamma squeeze; if there's a lot of deep OTM PUT buying, that sets up for a downwards gamma squeeze.
   * Right now, GME put buying heavily outweighs calls so, if anything, we're setup to squeeze lower.
* When there is **net option buying** (be it puts or calls) that creates **negative gamma** (the MMs) **which fuels volatility** and exacerbates price movements.
* When there is **net option SELLING**, that creates **positive gamma** **which suppresses volatility** and favors mean reversion to the largest gamma strike.
   * I'm of the belief that positive gamma creates a lot of support for SPY, and I use it to guide my SPY positions. It's worked out well for me, so that's why I use it.
* **Seriously, don't buy deep OTM short-term options**. 99 times out of 100 you're throwing your money away (that's why the delta is basically 0).
* There is a lot more nuance to this, such as options expiration, IV, long/short positions, and other things that are too complicated to discuss in one post. I've tried to simplify things, and hopefully I didn't make any mistakes in the process. When you consider that MMs are short some options and long others, it makes things more complicated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1kor/the_gamma_squeeze_explained_gamma_theory_for_monke/,"Great post.

> “Rates are actually going up as really an expression of the potential that economic activity is likely to start accelerating, and we’ll likely see some inflation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
> Hogan said investors will stay most focused on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which Democrats are pushing forward. If it is signed into law at its current size, the total federal spending due to the pandemic would be $5.3 trillion, according to Cowen, an investment bank.
*****
> “I think the path of least resistance has resumed to a higher level. I think we had a mini correction a week ago and I think it happened pretty quickly,” said Hogan of National Securities.
*****
> “I think we continue to grind higher and the only bumps in the road that I can see are a delay in fiscal stimulus or some exogenous factor come in and changes the dynamics,” he added.
*****
> The market is also depending on continued improvement in new virus cases, said Hogan.
*****
> # Higher interest rates
> The prospect of more spending and an improving economy drove Treasury yields higher in the past week.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% late Friday, after edging to 1.18% earlier in the day, near its recent high of 1.19%.
*****
> The 10-year is the most closely watched, as it influences the rates on mortgages and other consumer and business loans. Yields rise as the price of bonds decline.
*****
> Market pros have also been watching another bond market metric: the yield curve.
*****
> It is the spread between the yield on a short-term Treasury, like the 2-year note, and a longer duration Treasury, like the 10-year. In that case, the spread widened to reach 1.06% over the course of the week.
*****
> That is the highest level since the second quarter of 2017. A steeper curve — which is what we’re seeing today — is viewed as a sign of an improving economy.
*****
> Strategists say the move higher in Treasury yields so far is not detrimental to stocks, but instead is a reflection of the economic bounce that could come from the stimulus package.
*****
> Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said the steepening curve is good for the stock market, creating a tailwind for his “epicenter” trade in stocks that will benefit from an improving post-Covid economy.
*****
> His preferred sectors are the cyclicals — including industrials, consumer discretionary, materials, energy and financials.
*****
> Lee said the selling by hedge funds after short squeezes in a number of stocks and the record decline in the VIX, the volatility index, has led him to change his view on the stock market. He previously expected a sell-off in the first half of the year.
*****
> Now, Lee sees a “high probability that the first half 2021 correction is over.” The VIX, which is based on puts and calls in the S&P 500, started the week over 33 and fell to 20.87 when the market closed on Friday. A low VIX signals lowered expectations for market volatility.
*****
> The sectors that did well in the past week were mostly the ones that will do better in a financial rebound, or in a higher rate environment. Financials were 6.6% higher in the past week as big banks rose along with the yield curve. Higher long-term interest rates are a positive for bank profits.
*****
> The industrial group rose 4.9%, and materials were up 3.9%. Energy, lifted by a jump in oil prices, gained 8.3%. Tech recovered some ground, gaining 4.9%.
*****
> Sectors that do not do particularly well with rising rates, were up less, including utilities, up 2.3%, and real estate investment trusts, up 3%.
*****
> “It’s really about having an economic boom, allowing policy to support that boom,” said Jim Caron, head of global macro strategies on the global fixed income team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “That’s the key driver of why the curve is steepening.”
*****
> Some strategists say the curve is also steepening because of the U.S. will be issuing a lot of debt to pay for the trillions in fiscal stimulus, and that would cause interest rates to rise.
*****
> That has also triggered concerns about increasing inflation. While economists do not expect inflation to spike, they do see the potential, for the first time in years, for inflation to move meaningfully above 2%.
*****
> Markets will also be monitoring the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, which begins Feb. 9.
*****
> “It will get a lot of attention. Do the markets care? Maybe not, but everyone will be paying attention,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities.

> # Post-Election Februarys Have Been Even More Troublesome

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a3e19a00cddddb7704cdd8a753391f6e/21a0af750a31c87e-f0/s500x750/12edd49a31c1cf7460cb21815b25d793853b7db8.jpg))**

> From yesterday’s post, we knew February has a tepid recent record. In post-election years, February’s historically record has been even worse as historical average losses swell. In order to include as much data as we have available, we are using DJIA data since 1901, S&P 500 since 1930, NASDAQ from 1971 and Russell 1000& 2000 data beginning in 1979. When comparing post-election year February to the recent 21-year February seasonal pattern, the overall shape and trend does not change greatly however, weakness becomes more prevalent as the mid-month surge is less pronounced and second half declines expand.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3c9c5cb8cb9d933fd2d96b686791066c/21a0af750a31c87e-1e/s500x750/26d3402fd26a76aa62cc8617497bd3095256cb33.jpg))**

> Breaking down historical performance by year confirms frequent post-election-year February losses, most notably by NASDAQ and DJIA. Generally speaking, when February is positive it is an “ok” month, but when the month has been down, it has frequently been down by sizable amounts. There are seven double-digit losses in the table and not a single double-digit gain.

*****

> # Typical February Trading: Lackluster Over Last 21 Years

> February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&P 500 has averaged a measly –0.04%. Over the last 21-year period S&P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.6% in February. February’s first trading day has historically been good, like yesterday, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities over the last 21 years. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been somewhat disappointing for bulls.

> # As Goes January, So Goes The Year

> Stocks got off to a nice start in 2021, until the late January selloff, as everyone got GameStop fever. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2021?

> There’s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, “As goes January, so goes the year.” This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?

> As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.7% on average over the final 11 months and were higher barely 60% of the time.

> “A weak January could foretell of rough times ahead in 2021,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The good news is lately the trend has been broken, as stocks have done quite well after a weak January.” In fact, 8 of the past 9 times January saw stocks lower the final 11 months finished higher.

> # Have We Seen the Top in Negative Yielding Debt?

> Negative yielding debt has been one of the most extraordinary and peculiar consequences of global monetary policy initiatives, turning the basic premise of fixed income investing upside down. Instead of one party lending another party money, and the lender receiving interest in return for the risk incurred, since 2018 the levels of outstanding debt in which the lender pays the borrower for the privilege of loaning the borrower money has skyrocketed. This has left both lenders and fixed income investors in the unfortunate situation of attempting to “lose less” rather than “earn slightly more” than the value of the loan extended.

> The total value of negative yielding debt around the globe set a new record in the final month of 2020, eclipsing more than $18 trillion as governments around the world issued debt to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of these bonds are issued by governments in the developed world such as Japan and Europe, while US Treasuries remain one of the few sovereign bonds in the developed world that held positive yields throughout the pandemic. Though the Federal Reserve has committed to keeping short-term rates near zero for the foreseeable future, it should come as a relief to investors that thus far, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has dismissed the idea of negative short-term rates in the U.S.

> However, negative yielding debt does affect U.S. investors. Even after accounting for the costs of hedging out currency risks, Japanese investors can obtain 70 bps more in yield by investing in the U.S. 10-year Treasury note compared to a 10-year Japanese government bond, while German investors can earn 0.37% after hedging costs, compared with the -0.45% current yield of the German 10-year bund, which is the highest level in nearly five months. These factors increase demand for U.S. debt, which has helped to depress Treasuries yields and dampen the outlook for fixed income investors.

> What does the future of negative yielding debt look like? As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the good news is that this amount of negative yielding debt has declined substantially in the past two months and fallen back below the previous record high set in 2019. We believe this amount should continue to fall in 2021 as global economies recover and safe-haven yields rise, contributing to the 10-year Treasury yield moving toward our year-end 2021 forecast of 1.25–1.75%.

Guess what?  You can never gain unless you sell either. 

Trading is fundamentally easy:
1 Buy low
2 Sell high
3 Repeat

You broke rule one or two (maybe both), now you're holding a bag, and trying to find a greater fool to take it off your hands at more than $450.

Here's some tough love: You won't find one. 

You can run with the herd, but when it changes direction and runs the other way, be prepared to change your mind.

There's no rule that says you have to make your money back on the same company you lost it on.

Many many of didn’t get in to sell- we LIKE deep fucking value... so either you are a bot or HF shill. Which is it?Everyone is speculating at this point. I have no real basis for holding other than i believe it will rise again and you have none in saying it will go down. The restrictions were just lifted. The media manipulation is still ongoing.

The fact that Gamestop was a failing brick and mortar is irrelevant at this point.

🚀's are red

🍅's are red

🚀🍅🚀

🍅's 🌈🐻's soon to be 💀

*(Real TLDR's at bottom)*

***”Why the !@&amp;? would I want that 🍅 growing stock?""***

Yo, brother, calm down that anger.

I'm not providing investment advice so stop right here if you like.

We're just having a casual conversation about a bunch of things on a stock [I'm personally YOLOing 65k on](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lddvy7/vff_getting_ready_for_its_next_take_off/). (Aka my positions, no ban!)

If you're unaware though, this 30 year produce (🍅) growing company has been utilizing their decades of experience to grow Cannabis with stellar results so far and with 2021 looking to be really good for them.

Specifically, this will be on show these first two quarters of the year.

An important side note is that as of November 2nd, they now privately own the full 100% of Pure Sunfarms, their Cannabis subsidiary.

***""Oh I should get in NOW, huh? I see that $***🍅 ***ran recently, why would it keep running?""***

Great question brother! Of course, that's up to you! But...

$🍅 actually has multiple aspects as to why this has a very likely chance to run, then stay at a price that is probably higher than you would think ""reasonable,"" and then still have more runs throughout the year.

First way to try and back this up, is pointing out that this low float stock of only 77,820,000 shares has a CEO that owns 12% of the stock himself, and a total of 13.6% owned by the Management and Board.

On top of that, another +12% of the float is held by institutional holders for an immediate 25% of this already low float stock off the table.

More on the float in a moment, but with that quick knowledge we next just need to take a quick peek at how $🍅's main competition's Share Price (SP), Share Count and Market Caps (MC) compare.

AFTER EACH COMPANIES **MARKET CAP (MC)** IS HOW MUCH EACH COMPANIES **SHARE PRICE (SP)** CAN GROW PER MARKET CAP GAIN OF $1 BILLION.

*As of close on February 5th:*

*Canopy Growth*: SP - $42.93 - 373,730,000 Shares

- $*16,044,228,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $2.68 per $1B MC

*Cronos Group*: SP - $12.01 - 356,190.000 Shares

- $*4,277,842,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $2.81 per $1B MC

*Aphria*: SP - $16.67 - 312,570,000 Shares

- $*5,210,542,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $3.20 per $1B MC

*Tilray*: SP - $25.72 - 148,260,000 Shares

- $*4,070,447,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $6.32 per $1B MC

*Aurora*: SP - $12.88 - ""183,660,000 Shares""

- $*2,365,541,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $5.44 per $1B MC

$🍅*/Village Farms*: SP - $15.09 - 77,820,000

- $*1,174,304,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $12.85 per $1B MC

So, not only are they way behind in Market Cap, *even to Aurora*, but the amount that $🍅 can gain in Share Price to get there is unmatched.

I'm not saying the other companies should go down...

I'm just sayin... look at this...

VFF - $2,000,000,000 Market Cap?

$🍅 - $25.70

VFF - $3,000,000,000 Market Cap?

$🍅 - $38.55

VFF - $4,000,000,000 Market Cap?

$🍅 - $51.40

VFF - $16,000,000,000 Market Cap?

$🍅 - $205.60

***”So what? They are THAT much behind the competition.""***

Hey, I get it brother, we've only talked only about superficial stock related info so far. 

Just setting the base in understanding it's growth potential based on their industry competitiors.

We're getting there, I promise!

Just one more thing about $🍅's current positioning though, which factors in a bit of a short squeeze.

Now, don't get it twisted, this is not a post about some one-time short squeeze, just a brief mention.

Just, *in this moment*, it so happens the timing could cause a little extra pop for this incoming next fundamental and technical run that will establish $🍅's new base level.

[Check it out, from 1/22 - 2/2 an average of 50% of the daily volume was short](https://fintel.io/ss/us/vff). Averaging about 25% of volume going short daily on either side of it as well.

This heavy shorting came at the heals of a recent company action that caused quick downward pressure on the Share Price and in turn gave *greedy* 🍅🌈🐻's ability to try and push it down unreasonably.

Did you notice the most recent closing price is $15.09 on Feb 5th?

You might not have noticed though, that on January 14th, $🍅 had a mini run and peaked at $15.05.

The next day, on January 15th, $🍅 dropped for a close of $12.65.

Closing above that previous mile stone means every short since the raise is now underwater. Just sayin'.

***”What happened that caused that drop?""***

Good things happened, brother. Good things. And... *they got shorted for it*...?

$🍅 announced a direct share offering that injected US$135Million cash to the bank @ $12.60, giving shorters a bit of strength over the last two weeks of January.

This semi large difference between the offering and Share Price at the time is indicative of something very important about this raise.

This was a planned raise that had nothing to do with the run $🍅 was going on *IMO*.

*IMO*, don't mistake this raise, *that closed on U.S. Inauguration Day*, as anything other than preparation for growth and expansion. They are already executing profitably, they in no way needed this for normal functions.

You have to understand, our ol' 🍅 is extremely diligent and resourceful in their approach to Cannabis so far, and will continue to going forward.

Their lack of splash is probably why you likely haven't heard or considered them yet, but the precise and profitable execution is why you should do DD on them.

Oh, by the way...

$🍅 has some of the best positioning and assets for the now inevitable U.S. legalization of Cannabis.

***”How is this Canadian LP, $***🍅 ***, any better set for the U.S. market than their competition?""***

Again, stellar question's brother.

And, again, multiple factors to this.

Our first factor is a direct shout out to that $135M raise.

Quoting the 🍅 CEO from their most recent earnings report conference call and in reference to potential U.S. strategies, ""...*we're prepared to look at, if we have to do acquisitions or strategic partnerships and other locations*...""

That $135M putting them +$200M in bank is taking a certain type of vision, to me.

***”What, I'm suppose to believe your opinion that they have U.S. potential from a quote and your speculation?""***

Naw brother, you're suppose to understand that *fact* because they already have 5.7 Million SqFt of ""Hemp"" grow space ready to go in Texas.

Speculation and understanding how this company functions is part of my YOLO call strikes though.

A heads up, Cannabis uses the same growing system and could ""*be rapidly converted to cannabis production*"" the moment ready. - 🍅 CEO

Even beside the U.S. Blue Wave that will have some type of effect on Cannabis, Texas has put forth multiple pieces of legislation up for up for debate on it's own.

With, or without my personal speculation on their raise, their Texas assets are shaping up to be extremely valuable for them in the likely near-term future.

Icing on the cake of it all is simply that they are in no rush at all for when it happens.

They're currently profitable, and growing from their Canadian and other international positions as well, so U.S. legalization is simply a massive bonus whenever it happens, not a necessity.

*Like for some unnamed others...*

***”Yeah, so what? That still doesn't say WHY $***🍅 ***would keep running outside of hype.""***

Hey, absolutely that's fact.  *So far.*

Now that we understand their comparative surroundings and asset ready U.S potential, let's bring in some internal 🍅 Cannabis biz facts.

Here are a couple of the most recent earnings, Q3's, Cannabis specific highlights:

*75% increase in Net Sales*

*81% increase in Gross Profits*

Impressive as that is, it's important to understand this is not some one-off fluke, but the first point in the provable continuation of their launching point for growth, which was Q3's the prior quarter, Quarter 2 2020.

I say launching point because of the execution of strategy over the last year and they have a lot of factors on why they will continue to see growth in their numbers.

The key to understanding the earnings and $🍅 share price growth potential is in the timeline details of their release approach for new strains, products, product segments, and accessibility.

***”What, a few random new products is you're point?""***

Well, it's a part of the main reason on *timing* of the moments before earnings, yes.

Because brother, it's not just *any* new products, but specific new segments of products that are brand new pies of profitability to eat from for extra growth potential generally...

...*and also how they set up their earnings reports for ""surprise"" growth effects with a specific style of WHEN they release their new products.*

This upcoming Quarter 4 Year End 2020 report with be the first quarter to have their 2.0 products available for a FULL quarter. Our feature earnings growth products for Q4 are Vapes and Oils.

Being released mid-September, the very end of Q3, that Q3 report got a nice C$1Million boost in Net Sales from the roll out and because of the timing of release Q4 will see an exponential effect of growth from that segment due to that timeline of release.

Similarly, Quarter 1 2021, aka right now, will have TWO additional new segment effects!

On December 21st, just before the end of Q4, they started offering their products for Medical for the first time through a deal with Shoppers Drug Mart.

An important key to this Medical deal is this is their first entry into Quebec, the last 30% of Canada they need. 🍅's brand was also the first brand to offer anything in the Ounce size for the Shoppers consumers.

Seeing the ~1 week effect medical might be interesting!...

to me....

Our other brand new segment that is now fully rolled out is edibles!

Earlier in January, 🍅 announced a deal with White Rabbit, an edible company with a vegan, gluten-free craft gummy company with a manufacturing process call EAT ME. 

With this, 🍅 has started offering White Rabbit products as of about mid January.

By establishing this parternship, 🍅 now has access to that process and as of February 5th now released their own branded edibles as well.

Pretty forward thinking and sustainable to ensure to grab a good tasting vegan and gluten-free craft gummy.

This win-win situation means no messing with growing pains, straight to the bottom line move. Love it.

***”Again, so what? Wha..""***

Don't mean to be rude, but I *wasn't* done yet...

Both the upcoming Q4 and Q1 have additional bonus growth factors!

For Quarter 4, first week of October, aka first week of Quarter 4, saw the release of their newest higher THC and higher priced Pink Kush and D.Bubba strains were release in their large 14g and 28g formats.

When these strains released for the 7g and less formats on a similar timeline fashion, the small format sizes saw an increase of 33% on Net Sales over the Volume sold.

Like I said, simply bonus growth factors from the decades old 🍅 company that understands the importance of showing growth Quarter over Quarter in a flooded industry with such tremendous potential.

For Quarter 1, early January also saw the release of their High THC vapes in addition to their current offerings.

***”Bro, are you done yet?""**

Okay okay jeez, I get it.

*There's still just like one-ish more things though...*

On a very quick view of some Marco-level elements, many provinces had extra legal red tape on providing licenses with Ontario being one of them.

Ontario also just so happens to be 🍅's biggest customer, and had also been known for being a province with the least amount of stores for the amount of population they have.

In August 2020, they upped the number of store licenses they were issuing from 20 to 40 per month, just in time for Q4...

In December 2020, they doubled it again to 80 licenses a month, just in time for Q1...

To put a little perspective on that, by the end of the most recently reported quarter, Q3 2020, about 190 licenses were issued.

By Q3 2021, approximately 1,070 licenses will have been issued. 

Generally, about ~90% of the licensees have their stores up and running each time Ontario reports its updates. That's a lot more stores brother.

This matters because we also know the 🍅's brand is increasing in popularity for Ontario as well.

After being +13% of the OCS's volume from October 2019 to October 2020, October 2020 specificallywas 15% of the dried flower volume going 🍅 brand. Aka increasing in popularity.

On top of that, we were also told their brand new segment, vapes, was about *top ~3 ish* for Quarter 4 in the OCS as of November.

***”This still doesn't really explain why they will grow... does it?""***

Look brother, it's a Reddit post that's already too long but I believe I've shown a lot of 🍅 positive factors to add on top of what was already going to see growth by itself.

The Cannabis industry is hot right now you guys.

Beyond retail, their Wholesale segment experienced a +140% surge in volume and sales in Q3 as well, with indicators that Q4 will continue steady growth in that cornerstone of additional revenue.

Being the cheapest producer in the game will continue to have it's benefits. If you think it's Aphria, you are incorrect. Aphria is solid, but the 🍅 beats them out pretty easily. 

Aphria Market Cap is also $5B to 🍅's $1B...

When it comes down to it, this Quarter 4 earnings report needs to speak for itself. I have my own personal opinion on what it might look like. Do your own research for your own opinion, brother.

Finally, just so you're in-the-know, my last notes are some recent analyst price targets for $🍅

Global Alliance - $20

Roth Capital - $22

Raymond James - $26

Beacon 1-year target - $35

Some supposedly big German Stock magazine - $30

Random people on Twitter - $+20

**Well, fun conversation brother!**

**Don't forget, this was in zero ways financial advice, but if you wanted more not intended to be the basis of any investment decision $**🍅 **related information, or wanted to try and argue some point you think I jumped to,** [I wrote a very deep dive VFF analysis with Q4 prediction](https://justwantgainz.bobson.com/p/reddvffdd) **potentially worth checking out first (+40% Gross Sales and +60% Gross Profit conservatively predicted).**

**TLDR;**

1 ) Comparatively, Village Farms (🍅)'s Market Cap is 1/16 of Canopy, 1/4 of Cronos, 1/5 of Aphria, 1/4 of Tilray, and 1/2 of Auroras.

2 ) Being a low float stock with 25% institutional holders and massive recent shorting that is now underwater will likely cause an extra short squeeze on top of the incoming technical/fundamental run.

3 ) 5.7 Million Sq Ft of grow space in Texas ready for quick and immediate Hemp to Cannabis conversation at the drop of any U.S. Legislation. Also, $🍅 cashed up for acquisition potential.

4 ) Release time line for Vapes, Oils, High THC Large Format Offerings, Medical (with Quebec), High THC Vapes, 3rd Party Gummies and 1st Party Gummies will all have debut showings on these upcoming Quarter 4 2020, Quarter 1 2021 and Quarter 2 2021 earnings reports.

5 ) Massively increasing store number from 🍅's best consumer, continued best-in-industry grow process for continued Wholesale strength, increasing quality and popularity of their products show positive trends of growth from their current segments as well as all the new ones.

6 ) Scroll up a smidge to check some analyst price targets.

The CEO, Mike DeGiglio is the real deal.  The only one in the entire Canadian Cannabis sector.  

He’s got a huge stake in this and, folks, that’s the kind of business you want to invest in. 

What the OP hasn’t got into is that the rest of its business (veggies) is turning the corner and becoming profitable too.  Whereas other cannabis companies have $-losing side businesses, this one’s core business is doing well during the pandemic.  Additionally, VFF generates its own power off s local landfill’s Biggs and used the power and CO2 to boost productivity in their Delta greenhouses.   Nobody else does this.  Thirdly, they are in best / warmest growing belt in all of Canada.  In ACB-land it’s -30 this week.  In Delta it’s +5C!

607,The good news about your GME story,"WSB has a huge number of new users, many of whom are first-time bagholders as well. I think we should welcome the new users with open arms. Hi. Welcome.

I'm going to talk about the past few weeks and where things could go from here.

&#x200B;

**THE PAST**

In my opinion, no matter what happens going forward, GME was a total success. It was a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence and retail traders made it happen—that's amazing. It's now an international story. Incredible. I know it's still developing and I'm not informed enough to comment on specific outcomes here, but I think it's awesome. It happened, in large measure, because of the awesome due diligence written by some of the hyper-smart retards of this sub.

A big part of the story is DFV. I caught on to [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) pretty late, only a few months ago when his account broke $2M. I was astonished at his conviction, and hypnotized by the prismatic, dancing light refracting through his diamond fucking dick. Right now, even if GME drops back to $20 tomorrow, he will be worth something like $15M (he's sitting on $13.8M cash). That's... I don't even have a word for how cool it is. His red headband and aviators belong in the Smithsonian.

Some folks made a ton of money on GME, and some are bagholding a fat loss. That's OK. Even the best traders have losses. And it may prove to be super valuable to some of you, because that heavy bag you're holding has a voucher tucked into the side pocket. Yep, right there... no no, outside pocket—yes. See it? That voucher holds a tremendous opportunity:

**It's the opportunity to stop being a dumbass**. ***But how?***

&#x200B;

I'm gonna briefly diverge here to talk about my WSB story. I joined summer of 2020, knowing nothing, but was drawn in by these insane GAIN posts that kept popping up on my feed. I didn't know what a fucking call or put was—shit, *I didn't even know how to buy a share of a stock*. But I lurked, and obsessed, and kinda started to figure things out, little by little.

Then came Purple (PRPL). I read the extensive DD, I followed the stock price movement closely, I even followed the CEO on Twitter (he doesn't tweet much). I looked into the play as much as I knew how, and when I pulled the trigger *I was so confident*. I sunk $3.5k into debit spreads (something you too can learn!), which was more than I was comfortable losing. But I was confident—they were going to crush earnings so it was pretty much a guarantee.

Well, earnings missed. Just a bit. The stock dipped and kept dipping. Over the next week I was down something like 80%, I don't remember exactly. I was pretty crushed. I was so mad at myself, ""Of fucking course a stock can go down, *why would you think it can only go up?*"" Recrimination, doubt. I knew I wasn't cut out for this...

But I kept coming back to WSB if only, at first, to salve my wounds with the loss porn of fellow fallen PRPL nurples. Then I watched more YouTube videos on options. And I learned—mostly from people on this sub—how to minimize the financial pain of that loss, and maybe break even.

I bought shares, I learned how to sell covered calls. I don't remember exactly everything I did, I was experimenting and learning. After a few months I eventually I broke even.

And I kept experimenting, and watching, and reading.

Beginning of this year I deposited a bunch of money into my brokerage and put myself in really solid positions that I liked. I armed myself with knowledge, I knew my entry points, I knew when I wanted to take on more risk. **As of today, I am in spitting distance of doubling my account since the beginning of the year. That fucking rules.**

I'm still learning. I don't know everything. In fact, I think I'm still a novice, and who fucking knows I could blow my account up tomorrow. But the more I learn, the more the picture of trading becomes illuminated, instead of the inscrutable dark mass it was six months ago.

&#x200B;

**THE FUTURE**

I don't know what's going to happen to GME in the next week, month, year. No idea. If you want to hold GME forever and not really think about the stock market, that's totally fine. But, if you want to dig yourself out of a hole, if you want to keep going with stonks, here's the good news: you can learn.

So what do you do now?

**Shut the fuck up and listen to smarter people**. And read. And watch videos. And see what experienced traders and investors are doing.

Because this sub has recently turned into a roiling ocean of samethink, many of you don't know the power of this place: *you're sitting on a fucking gold mine*. I have read due diligence in here that rivals that of professional analysts, and in some cases is *more insightful and more detailed* (and always funnier)*.* And IT'S FREE.

Do you think DFV got into GameStop on a whim? Because he thought it would be a fun little troll play, and that maybe he could stick it to the hedge funds along the way? No. Go watch his YouTube channel. He knows what he's doing. He is a **fucking pro**.

Remaining stupid isn't an option—you want to be a *smart* retard, not a *dumb* retard.

Before I get too Glengarry Glen Ross on y'all asses, here are some tough love, concrete suggestions:

&#x200B;

**Stop posting and** ***telling*** **people to buy, hold, or sell stonks**

* That's not your call and it may be illegal
* It's amateurish and cringey
* It's perfectly fine to share your positions or say you're still holding

&#x200B;

**Stop calling it a movement**

* We're here to make money, learn, and help each other do both—it's not a political movement
* It's profoundly cringey

&#x200B;

**Stop spamming posts asking if GME, AMC, BB, NOK will ""go up""**

* No one *really* knows
* *You* decide whether you should sell or hold
* If you have relevant information about the stonk, that's great! Post it. ""Will XXX go up?"" is not relevant.

&#x200B;

**Take a break from reddit, your broker, even your computer/phone**

* Staring at a stonk for hours, hoping it will go up, is not healthy—trust me
* You'll be doing your brain a service if you step back and come back refreshed

I came for the hype, I’m staying to learn.Why there is so many smartasses on wsb recently? Been lurking for half a year and I remember this sub was mostly just average joes gambling with calls.I just use to come here for memes but one day i saw a DD from someone's wife boyfriend on NVAX and he was getting shat on by everyone in the comments and ""i have a phd in biology"" types. But this guy seemed genuine so i did some of own DD and thought he could be right.... he was. NVAX was $80 its now $290! I hope that guy got rich.

i'm guessing a lot of the ""bad mods"" that were ""kicked out"" just came back with alts.I’ve seen some good DD come through when sorting by new, it just gets maybe a dozen upvotes before being drowned out by all the bullshit. I think it’s mostly a result of how big the sub has gotten.

The auto mods are also in overdrive. I got scolded because I used the word kidz but with an s. Apparently it’s a penny stock symbol...

So I think between rabid auto mods and heavy traffic it’s all getting lost. The DD I do come across usually starts with “this is my tenth attempt, hopefully it goes through”. 

I think the mods just need some time to tweak auto mods to work properly with the new volume of users

611,There needs to be a truce between Gme holders and old timers,"This is getting ridiculous. Half the sub is yelling HOLD and the other half is yelling SELL. I'm holding my shares and i don't need you apes to tell me when i need to get out. I will when i'm satisfied. 

And GME people need to slow down with their spams and circlejerking. I agree it's making the sub ridiculous.

We can all co-exist in this sub. No need to tell people to go to another sub just because you don't like it. Things change and GME was much bigger than a sub with ~2 million members at the time. 

This unrest will destroy the sub not gme holders or old timers.

/endrant

Edit: with 8 million members now, you can't just attack whoever says gme. As old timers you need to show the way of WSB. Or you can go to another sub and let this one rot. Your call.

Edit2: The response this post got just shows the ""old timers"" are just angry fucks. There are more than 6 million new members.

Lots of useless threads. That’s all.What are you talking about, for every sell post there are 10 hold and buy GME posts.  There is no chance for the older members to teach newcomers the way because they're downvoted unless they say anything but a GME bull case.  Newcomers are spamming conspiracy theories about bots and price manipulation and if anyone goes against it they're instantly downvoted.

612,Stay Vigilant and Skeptical,"There are so many imposters among us, and if you're new, it might not be as obvious. This is one more post to remind you to remain skeptical and analyze the posts you're reading and do your own DD. I'm not a super OG here, but I've been around for over a year and it's insane how obvious the trickery is, how many super manipulative posts and comments I'm seeing that oppose this sub's mantra right now. SO MUCH sudden gain porn amount gme sellers, posts trash talking holders, saying holding is a bad strategy when you're down, and posts trying to justify selling right now in any way possible. They are designed to sound logical, or even be filled with a few logical points, with the part about how you should sell carefully transplanted in. BULLSHIT obviously. Listen, retard, you don't typically buy SHARES to try to make a fat short term gain, you trade options, so anyone convincing you that it's a normal, good idea to buy and sell shares on highs and lows in a small time frame is a dumbass. If you buy shares, you typically hold for longer than a fucking week and go for a ride for some real growth; or you learn your hypothesis was wrong or was changed by an event and you pivot. This is normal. Yes, there is a potential squeeze, which is more reason to keep your fucking pants on. Yes, the hypothesis has remained 100% unchanged, though certain news sources will try to have you believe otherwise. Missing a high isn't the end of the world, be patient and it will inevitably surpass that price in some amount of time if the company isn't doomed (it's not) and the economy isn't tanking (it's not). In this case, probably pretty god damn soon. At least if you don't listen to me listen to fucking Cuban, his words were a blessing for this sub, powerful messages to keep us united through this shit storm coming from someone that has a lifetime of experience. Remember why you bought GME, has it changed? Then continue pursuing the value play you started until it does. If you bet more than you can afford to say goodbye to for months/years, you probably fell prey to fomo and are an amateur. That's not ideal, so don't ruin your life over this shit, be realistic. If you can afford to, it's common fucking sense to hold right now. Hey, now you get to learn to weather a storm like any seasoned trader so SIT DOWN, BUCKLE UP, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP.

613,Hard Truth: It's Entirely Mathematically Possible for Shorts to Cover Last Week,"If a share can be shorted multiple times, it can be bought and covered multiple times. 

How did 140% short ratio happened:

A has one GME share, A loans the share to B, B sold it short to C, C loans it to D, D sold it short to E. One share, shorted twice. B and D both needs to cover their shorts when they needed to. 

The same scenario can be played the other way around. 

Hedge Fund A bought 1 share from Bank B to cover and return to Bank C, Hedge Fund D then bought the same share from Bank C to cover and return to Bank E. One share, covered twice. 

Now imagine last week, the price is above $200, you are a greedy ass Wall St bank and you have a lot of GME shares on hand and a lot of shares loaned out, do you :

(1) sell it to the shorts multiple times for ridiculous gain yourselves?

or 

(2) just shrug and let the retails take this cake?

The trading volume for GME is above 300m per week for the last  4 weeks, with the highest week to be 550m.  the short float was 72m at its peak. The trading volume is enough for them to cover multiple times every week.

Have they actually covered? Your call. Fuck if I know.

I keep going back and forthHard truth is: nobody knows. 

For any 1 theory you will find 5 others against it. We had multiple DDs and an army of analysts going over it. The general consensus is: wait and hold, if you can, but leave if you must.

No amount of analysis will reveal the answer ahead of time. You can be sure the best of the best already looked into this. so people 100x smarter than us digged in and came back inconclusive.

Basically everyone is in the red anyway, so holding is the best of option at this point. Many hold and just wanna see how it plays out, cause why not.. Just enjoy the weekend :)But what if... B==DI think it’s possible they re-shorted over 300...MaRkEt MaNiPuLaTiOn!Exactly. And if Iam not mistaken Scion had GME taking more than 50% of the portfolio. Does anybody believe they hold and ride it till zero? Or did they start covering since the price grew over 50 and sold as much as possible over the whole peak?

Plus every share bought back by shorts is returned and can be bought back again.",1612629922.0,13

Of course, this company is making a lot of money because of the covid but despite that I think the company is growing quite solidly and is creating a new type of market!

The peloton bike we all saw advertised last year did well due to pandemic forcing people away from gyms. All these fuckwads got their bikes, bike mats, and matching bike socks. 
In the US, vaccinations just surpassed new infections. This is bad for Pelaton. They say it would be about 9-12 months before things are back to normal and things reopen. By then gyms will be back to business and people will ride AcTuAL bikes. Peloton is a fad.

I prefer the old fashion way of lifting weights and running on the road/treadmill, so that’s where my bias comes into play.I use peleton, bikes are super high quality workouts are more engaging than any other home gym equipment.

Not financial advice, I'm just some random moron on the net.Peloton bikes and fitness equipment are ridiculously overpriced. I definitely could see them showing some great earnings coming up though, but in the long run people will go back outside and ride their real bikes and go back to spin classes for the social networking aspect. They will stick around due to ppl needing a bike in their house and ride for excerise when it's inconvenient to go outside due to it being dark or weather being a factor.

Think of all that it takes to run thousands of servers in the cloud.. the infrastructure is enormously complicated and there are tens of thousands of servers constantly switching tasks based on demand. Tech has developed cloud deployment and management tools like Kubernetes running Docker and the like. This field is called DevOps and it’s the playground of DevOps engineers. 

Now what if you want to automate as much as possible these incredibly complicated systems? How do you monitor diagnose and alert based on problems you may not even know exist? Can you build automated repair and optimization systems that go beyond the basic building block implementation? 

Enter Dynatrace, which is solving these problems with AI. They have AI anomaly detection, AI automated cloud management, and AI driven optimization.  

The potential for AI in the space is incredible and Dynatrace has only begun to capture market share. They are lightyears ahead of traditional DevOps tooling. 

They recently had a great quarterly report and have broken out of their trading range. A host of analysts have upgraded in recent earnings. As the market realizes their potential I believe there is massive upside especially in this tech bubble.

Monday is the show that they give every year. Kinda cringe most of the time, but show to where the company is moving to. Hope... 

After working with the competition of DT, they are miles ahead of any of them... and speaking about the OS...  is miles behind even of other players... (might speed up now with Splunk taking the torch in some case.) is nice to have things free, but is at least 6 years behind. 

DOA is mostly all the others that do a refresh of UI and nothing more (AppD / NewRelic), for DT... might happen in a few years if any of the Big players in Cloud space create something similar or buy them.

The main problem that they have is that all those that speak about their product as lack, they are speaking (most of the time) about their old platform appmon or whatever... That platform was a real disaster/PoS.

I can't post spit here",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le0y73/check_out_page_10_its_critical_this_gets_eyes/,"TLDR suppliers can fail to deliver shares indefinitely and it takes ages to force them to deliverBuying-in   “Buying-in” is the process in which a seller that has failed to deliver stocks is forced to purchase and deliver the stocks to the buyer.  This process is initiated by a buyer that fails to receive stocks and occurs with the mediation of the NSCC.  Any participant with an FTR at the end of a day may submit a Notice of Intention to Buy-In (a “Buy-In Notice”) specifying the quantity of securities it intends to buy-in (the “Buy-In Position”).  

For the purpose of this description, the day the Buy-In Notice is submitted is referred to as N, and N+1 and N+2 refer to the succeeding days.  The Buy-In Position is given high priority in the allocation algorithm that determines which participants will receive shares on a settlement day.  This high priority lasts from the “night cycle” (early morning) of N+1, through to completion of the CNS day cycle on N+2.  The high priority in the algorithm that allocates shares is likely to result in the Buy-In position being filled, without the FTD being resolved.  When this occurs, the FTR is passed on to a participant with lower priority in the allocation algorithm, for example, a participant that has just bought the stock.    


  If the Buy-In Position (or a portion thereof) remains unfilled after N+1, the NSCC issues CNS Retransmittal Notices on the morning of N+2 which specify the participant requesting the buy-in and the total amount called for in the Buy-In Notice.  The CNS Retransmittal Notices are issued to participants in order of the age of their FTD positions with the oldest FTD positions being first.  In aggregate, the Retransmittal Notices issued make up a quantity at least equal to the Buy-In Position.  The buy-in liability for any failing participant does not exceed the size of their FTD position.  If several participants have short positions with the same age, all such participants are issued CNS Retransmittal Notices, even if the total of their FTD positions exceeds the Buy-In Position.     

If the Buy-In Position is not satisfied by 3:00 PM on N+2, the participant may submit a Buy-In Order to the NSCC instructing the NSCC to buy-in the remaining position.  In such a case the NSCC would: (i) buy the shares from whatever market it chooses; (ii) deliver to the originator of the Buy-In Order (cancelling out the bought-in FTRs); (iii) cancel the FTDs corresponding to the bought in shares; and (iv) debit/credit any difference between the cash collateral held by the NSCC and the purchase costs including fees to the money settlement accounts of the participants with the bought-in FTDs.  NSCC allocates buy-ins and associated costs to participants (as mentioned previously, oldest fails first) and participants in turn allocate the buy-ins to their clients at their own discretion.  Anecdotal evidence suggests participants use this discretion to allocate a disproportionately small number of buy-ins to protected clients.

 Two aspects of this process that are most often misunderstood are as follows.  First, Buy-In Notices do not necessarily force a participant with an FTD position to close out that position by buying stocks.  This is because, as a first step in the buy-in process, putting the participant with the FTR on a high priority in the delivery algorithm makes it likely that they will receive their shares and the FTR position will be passed on to another participant.  Second, when a buy-in does force a participant with an FTD to purchase the stock, it is not necessarily the participant that the originator of the Buy-In Notice initially traded with.  This is because in the delivery process positions are netted and the NSCC assumes the role of counterparty to each transaction.  Instead, it is the participant with the oldest fails that is forced to buy the stock.   

  Buy-ins are rare.  Evans et al. (2009) find that out of a total of 69,063 failed transactions of a market maker in 1998-1999 only 86 were bought-in.  Boni (2006) argues that one reason why buy-ins are rare is that firms are unwilling to earn a reputation for forcing delivery in the hope that other firms will be equally lenient towards them when they fail to deliver.      

This overview of the clearing and settlement procedures suggests an alternative reason why buy-ins are rare.  Multilateral netting in CNS includes not only trades that are due to settle that day but also existing open positions such as FTRs.  The algorithm that determines which long positions will receive stocks, allocates shares to the oldest positions first, within a priority group.  This means that on any day in which the number of normal priority trades due to settle exceeds the number of FTRs, all existing FTRs will be passed on to the more recent long positions due to settle that day.  Given the earlier finding that FTDs represent approximately 1-5% of daily traded volume, it is only in rare circumstances or in very infrequently traded stocks that a participant would be left with an FTR for long enough to go through the Buy-in process.   While the open FTD and FTR position lasts, this arrangement is effectively an involuntary zero-fee zero-rebate equity loan from the buyer to the seller. 
 
If a naked short seller is forced to buy-in, then in order to maintain a short position they must buy the stock, deliver it to the initial counterparty and then naked short sell the stock again, together costing them the roundtrip transaction costs.  The NSCC may also charge a fee to the participant that fails to deliver, however, the fee is insignificant in relative terms.  Because the incidence of buy-ins is low and penalties for failing are small, naked short selling effectively is a way of short selling difficult or impossible to borrow stocksSo they can borrow indefinitely?you KNOW retards around here can't read.  Make a meme videoHere is the SEC's link for FTD's since 2004. 

Remember FTDs in the report are not just daily, but aggregate (daily + existing) FTDs and are not alone direct evidence of short or naked short selling.

630,My thoughts on firearms and ammunition companies as an investment strategy,"Good morning assholes.   


I see a lot of people in firearms-adjacent jobs and lifestyles talking up buying stock in gun and ammo manufacturing. I'm not, because I think it's a trap. And not because of any apocalyptic predictions, either. Hear me out.   


Manufacturing both firearms and ammunition requires a substantial investment to set up for, in terms of time and capital. Additionally, these companies can't get support in the form of loans from \*most\* banks because of being reclassified recently as ""high risk"" for money laundering. I don't agree with this, but what's right and what is real don't always intersect perfectly.   


Because of the temporary nature of the surge in demand, I believe that companies such as Fiocchi and one or two others which have recently added production floor space, \*only\* did so because they were already planning to do so for some time now. So far as I know, there have been no reactive expansions of production as a result of 2020's state of non-stop panic.   


Because after the hype settles down, ultimately, demand will eventually return to normal, most likely way too early for any expansion in production capabilities to lead to an increase in market share or saturation.   


A FEW POINTS AND COUNTERPOINTS:  
1. 2020 saw an unprecedented number of new gun owners. Won't that cause an increased long-term demand for ammunition?  
\-Probably not. My feel for the climate right now is that most of those firearms will end up rotting in a safe or getting resold secondhand for cheap and no longer contributing to a consistent demand. This surge in new owners is likely a major contributing factor to the current shortage. Once they all have the requisite one or two boxes that their gun-owner friend recommended they grab, that's probably it for them. That's still MILLIONS of boxes of ammunition, but unlikely to contribute anything in terms of long-term repeating purchases for the majority of new owners.   
2. What if new legislation is enacted?  
\-Then manufacturers will probably pivot toward compliant manufacturing and designs, much like what happened during the last AWB. Demand will surge for a short period and then drop slightly. Puts or shorts may be a better option than stocks or calls if you expect this to happen.  
3. What if nothing happens and things go back to normal?   
\-Then the price of stock should do about the same.   


TL;DR -   


Just because demand appears huge now doesn't necessarily mean there's much in the way of money to be made. A lot of the apparent surge in demand comes from a number of factors that make things look way worse than they really are, and none of these things is likely to last past the next year or two.  


I think buying an actual M1 Garand might be a better investment strategy, seeing as how they never actually seem to get any cheaper.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le0fm5/my_thoughts_on_firearms_and_ammunition_companies/,"Being heavily embedded in the firearms culture, I think from an investment standpoint with the most return would be ammunition companies, or manufacturers that make components for ammunition.  

Gun companies themselves have relatively low profit margins, and are always ripe to be singled out for political reasons when violence happens.

...and yes, you should get an M1 Garand.  It's my favorite rifle, and has an 80 year old trigger that's better than most of my new guns. 

The milsurp market is a great place to retain (or accrue) value, but it's a lot like the classic car or art market.  It may skyrocket in value...to some people.  You may have something really cool, but your only ""buyer"" may be a museum in some circumstances.At some point all the ammo hoarders are going to give up the ghost. If their kids see that grandpas supply of ‘06 is sky high they will sell. People have been hoarding for about 15 years now as long as the powder is kept dry it’s still good. I wouldn’t even want to guess how much ammo there is tucked away. Probably the same for firearms.I think most people who panic bought ammunition aren’t the same people who will rattle through 500 rounds a week. They’ll keep it for a long time, hence the temporary spike.

Firearms are likely same story - spikes might help R&D of new products but that panic factor is important. Unless like you said they get singled out by legislatorsI find that a lot of people embedded within the firearms community are Doomers. Constantly thinking there will be a apocalypse. Thinking they do not have enough supply. Ammo, shelf stable food, supply items(batteries, flashlights). Also politically, if a Democratic majority is in power, there will be regulation, which in turn drives price up of ammo and makes it scarce. I have heard before that Obama was the best thing to happen to the gun industry.It would be better to buy antique firearms and take care of them.I think a lot of people forget about 2008, when Obama was elected. There was a huge panic, tons of people bought as much .22lr as they could get their hands on, and manufacturers took out loans to pay for more capacity to meet the sudden increase in demand. When it turns out Obama didn't ban .22's like everyone thought he would, demand fell through the floor because everyone had a ton and the supply wasn't going away. So now you have a bunch of ammo manufacturers with huge loans and no income to pay it back, so several of them fall into bankruptcy. Personally I think the banks saw this happening again in the run up to the 2020 election and decided to classify them as high risk to try and prevent them from being able to get loans without actually being able to pay them back without going into bankruptcy. 

Personally, feeding into the ""prepper/doomsday"" minsdet in any way is dangerous and absolutely not a good idea. The only ""investments"" I make in guns are so I can continue to shoot cans with my buddies on the weekends.Invest in an arms manufacturer, then start a world warSmall point also, a lot of people around me realized how fun shooting is as a hobby. Just in my close circle of friends, not only did most pick up handguns, but also go to the shooting ranges regularly for entertainment now.Firing an M1 Garland was a treat",1612627376.0,20
631,"The More You Average Down, The Easier It Becomes For Your Stocks Reach Escape Velocity",,https://i.redd.it/d7jln4rwovf61.png,"This is **technically** not wrong. The trick is, you have to average down to a price the stock can genuinely eventually become.

Lets say it's GME, if you bought in at \~$300, the chances of GME ever reaching that by actual value of the company is extremely low. If GME crashes down to $2, that's far more likely to be under what the true value of GME can become. If you average down at $2 so that your price-per-share is about \~$10, then you have a much higher chance of breaking even than if it was at $300.

632,Is it Time to be more Bullish on Recoveries?,"With the senate voting, with Harris’s tie breaking vote, to move forward with the 1.3 trillion Covid relief bill ( The bill hasn’t  actually passed yet but most certainly will within the next few weeks) is it time to call/buy airlines, cruise lines, and other stocks hit hard by the pandemic again after they’ve stagnated for a while??? Is this bill the boost they need to finally come up by double digit % or is the hype around it far too great already?

At some point things are likely to come back, but this might be a little early to figure out who's going to survive this thing. This would be the perfect time for someone to YOLO on one for our amusement.I'm a no on this one. Unless Congress passes some sort of monthly recurring payment or a lot of people start getting vaccines real quick, it could be years before some of these industries recover.I think people are really underestimating how fucked the airline and cruise industry is. Specifically, airlines will take another decade to fully recover from all of this and some will not make it out. This is the sentiment coming from people inside the industry.The Covid relief bill =/= covid is gone.  Vaccines are going to take a long time. Recovery of those industries is going to take a while.Tempting but they have so much debt , cruise lines have billions in debt, years of profit taken away and the interest on the debt is 6-15% for the bonds. Plus they diluted stock 20-30%. High risk for sureFollowingMy take on this is to look at the auto manufacturers bail out from a decade ago. Many of these companies will survive and there will be a nice jump from the bottom, but they will likely fall to near historical lows before rebounding.I feel like its going to be calls on tech companies, EVs, SPACs, etc etc since I don't really see airlines or cruise stocks moving whatsoever within the next 3 months. Pretty much any stock you saw rise with a stimulus check payout will probably rise again. That and weed now.Yes.I’m just here to say thank you for a post about an idea not to do with GameStop.

This is what I’m in WSB for. The next idea that’ll result in massive gain or loss porn.

Thank you.

And: on topic, I think it’ll be a long while for travel to get back to normal. Think cruises to the Caribbean: how long until those destinations are vaccinated sufficiently to not require inbound/return quarantine when coming back to US ports? Could be a whole lot of time.

637,When does the whole monetary Ponzi scheme come crashing down?,"  As we all probably know the USD was taken off the gold standard in 1971. As we're the currencies of many other countries since that time.

Central banks have just been printing more fiat currency since then. Using debt to pay down debt, and needing more debt each time to pay off previous debt. It's a giant Ponzi scheme. 
This is devaluing the money at an astonishing rate, nothing is really getting more expensive, it's just our money and wages are continually being devalued.

But all fiat currency goes to zero value at some point. As it always has throughout history. 
I think the hyperinflationary debt crisis is coming soon. Just like Weimar republic Germany where they needed a ""wheelbarrow"" full of money to buy a loaf of bread.

Fake money can't go on forever.  And this time its global, because the world reserve currency is the USD which is backed by nothing.  China and Russia probably know this and that's why they're buying and hoarding gold.

Im sure this is what the whole ""great reset"" is that the world economic forum keeps talking about. Surely anyone who understands a few basic fundamentals about money and history would know this whole Ponzi scheme is going to blow up at some point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le01bz/when_does_the_whole_monetary_ponzi_scheme_come/,"Sir, this is a gay sauna.> **When does the whole monetary Ponzi scheme come crashing down?**

I don't really know what to do about that, but I'm clearly not a bot and if you can think of a way for me to prove I'm not a shill, I'm all ears.

Second, as some of you know because you've complained about it every time I do it, I've been posting a help message into the big threads on this subreddit, telling people that they can reach out and that they're not alone. I've received messages from over 500 people in the last 4 days, and they're all just happy to have someone to talk to, and to listen to them. Some of them only have a share or two of GME or a few dozen AMC, and some people bought in for over $100,000. 

Almost all of them are selling, or have already sold, and absolutely none of them are buying more. I would estimate, conservatively, that 4 out of 5 people who message me have already sold, and half of the ones who haven't tell me that they're going to ASAP. All of them find me from my posts on this subreddit, which is the most bullish place for GME that exists on the internet, and they're **still** all selling. Please, please, just sort by new on some of these threads, or on the subreddit's front page. Sort by new and read through the posts, and recognize that the sentiment you're seeing on the big posts on here does not reflect the majority, or reality.

Make your own decisions and do what's best for you, but please, understand that nobody is still in this. You are buying into a lie that is being pushed by people who are either trying to make money off of you or don't know any better and NEED to believe that this is going to come back up.

The money I put into my meme stocks, I am just going ti consider a total loss, and if it goes up at all, GREAT!!! If not, ok, I already consider it a loss.  In the mean time I have learned some valuable lessons and I learned a ton about the stock market, corruption, news/media and how it is controlled, and emotional investing.

This was a great experience and I am better because of it.  

My plan, at this point, is to hold what I have and diversify from here on out.

This isn't financial advice at all, but I do hope that it helps someone with any feelings of depression/anxiety.

If you can't afford to hold or you need bills paid, sell at a loss, it isn't admiting defeat, it is taking care of yourself.  Do what you have to do.

If the stock is at 5 bucks and rocketing to 8 or 9, the minute you put in a normal market order, the stock could have climbed to 12. Therefore, you bought at a higher price because of volatility.  Use a buy limit order instead. If you see it climbing, put a buy limit order for a price you're willing to pay.  For example I just wanna pay 7. Put a buy limit order for 7. If it climbs above 7, you will not buy which would have saved your ass. This stock is too volatile.  If the price was still 5, you would buy it at 5 to 7 dollars.  But it will buy at the lowest price below 7. For it to climb like that, someone must have bought a huge amount of shares.  Then those with sell limit orders at 9 dollars or higher, automatically sold all their shares, bringing the price back down.

Hedge funds attacked other hedge funds and did it under the smokescreen of retail investors!

The success of this hedge fund attack masked through wallstreetbets should be worrisome to us. They were so successful at this attack that they will keep trying to USE us to make more tendies that will leave a lot of us holding the bag! 

This wasn’t an attack against the system. This was a billionaire sector using us to attack another billionaire sector. Now how many of you are holding a bag because of it? And the amount of gme posts still being posted is sad, because it shows that a large group of you don’t understand this and are and will continue to be the victim! 

Anyone who trades with a political agenda, with anger, with spite, or as an offensive attack on another group will be left holding the bag!

Trading isn’t about trying to defeat a system. It’s not even about trying to defeat the stock market. The stock market will do what it does, it can’t be defeated, it doesn’t have emotional attachments to wins or losses.  It isn’t for or against any individual or group. It only does what it does and a great trader understands this and trades according to this standard. The only enemy in trading is yourself.

Losing money on a bet is one thing, but losing money on a bet where the other side cheated is fucking unacceptable.Just checked your history and it's odd how you spend a lot of time on Reddit writing against GME.

Why not just let it be?That last line is almost a direct line from Jobim Wave.I know Warren Buffet is stupid boomer that we all hate, but he said ""You should never argue with the market"" I think alot of GME losers are doing just that nowAbsolutely. The proof was Monday vs Tuesday two weeks ago. Monday saw a spike to $159 then a short attack. The stock moved sideways for the rest of the day. The very next day, every single selling action was countered hard (at least four or five times) and it was a steady climb to ATHs.
I am not sure what will happen next week but it might be volatile yet again, if the Short Interest remains high enough.No one believes that retail alone caused this. Yes there was billionaire and hedge fund money behind this. No this is not over, there’s plenty left to be squozed. You’re acting like this is a pump and dump that no one could fathom and that’s fucking stupid. Do you not see the wave of illegal shit that just happened. When 90% of traders are using one platform and that platform stops you from buying shares, only allows you to sell, manipulates margin requirements on a dime, holds your money hostage, changes the frequency of how quickly it removes money from your bank account and doesn’t let you access those funds to trade or restore your account, launches attacks in the media, etc. that is securities fraud and market manipulation on the highest fucking level. We lost momentum so their ladder attacks look effective. Many of us can’t even trade right now. Others are looking for brokerages. But the longer this has gone on, the more paper handed people have become and it’s disgusting and weak.I love how the second the stock goes down everyone at WSB realizes what a standard investor saw coming a million miles away.

I'm not new to this sub, but I don't really post either. I always lurk and talk shit. But, I did learn (""learn"" lmfao) investing from the dumb shit you guys post. I saw somewhere on reddit that you guys are getting bummed out by the $GME cult on here. So, I just want to thank the OG WSB retards, I made some money on this subs advice, but I lost about half as much to.

So thanks for being retarded, and giving me the courage (courage?) to try amateur investing. Mostly because I figure I can't do it worse than these guys.

Anyway, fuck owning stocks, puts an calls 4ever.

EDIT: PRovE IT! ;)

The fuck do I post pictures on this shit? $BB going places btw.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldzqrz/wsb_veterans_thanks_for_being_retarded/,"The gme cult will leave soon. Either the price drops and peoples interest will fade or it spikes and people will shut up once they sell. The problem is they will stay lurking and watch with greed what the next big thing will be. So even though its against my interest (cuz I own some gme) I hope gme will plummet. I hope the OGs cash out and focus on sth new. I hope DFV will not end up in prison or sth.

I expect downvotes from sour losers who wanted easy money. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)I'm kind of in the same boat as you. I knew of WSB before but this has ignited some interest for me.

Oil and gas certainly is not dead, and we're still DECADES away from getting off fossil fuels (especially natural gas).  I don't realistically see a future in the next 20-30 yrs without oil and gas. 

As new technology comes on and renewables become cheaper and more profitable, i think we'll see the big players jump in.

647,My First-Ever Stock Purchase - AMC,"I'm over 50 years old and made my first-ever stock purchase of AMC a bit late in the rally when it was selling at over $12.00.  I'm not what anyone would call a wealthy man, but I have a slush fund that I can use with discretion.  AMC closed 2/6/2021 at $6.83.

I'm not a hero trying to flash my diamond hands here, but I am going to hold AMC because I believe in it.  The time will come when it will repurpose itself to serve a broader audience and, consequently, it will begin to make money again.  I believe this in my soul.  It may take months.  It make take years.  Yet, it will return to its former glory.

Similarly, you

May have this same gut feeling -

""Hold the line,"" you say.


Many of us will

Continue to hold the line:

AMC will rise!

Yet, the value will rise!

It won't matter: we've held out in style.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldzodk/my_firstever_stock_purchase_amc/,"Sounds like you’re holding for the right reason and not because a bunch of apes are standing on it.

https://youtu.be/jQmhX7qpQrcIn the meantime use those shares to write covered calls dude! I sold 7 contracts ($8 calls) at $100 a pop friday. Ive recouped about $1,000 in the last week off just writing contracts on my 700 shares. With such high IV these covered calls are a goldmine and actually the only reason why I bought my shares (avg around $8 a share)Yep keep holding, never sellAmc was trading at 10+$ a few years ago. Imo when the pandemic is over and people are able to go to movies again then it might surge upward for a bit while people actually get to stretch their legs and leave the house.Amc will have its day, you will seeI agree.  Once vaccines start getting out to a majority of people, and they open doors again, It's going to start going up.  I'm just waiting until I can double down on it, without being stupid about it.I think AMC has a much better future than GMEI'm also 50 and a first time stock buyer with AMC at $13 and a few other 'meme' stocks. Whatever works for you but I have another strategy. 

I took a severe beating on AMC and GME and already out of GME at a loss. I bailed at $110 (in at $320). Rather than lose it all I vowed to actually learn what I'm doing and grow that loss back, even if it takes a year or more. The lesson learned and impetus to learn stock trading properly was worth the 3k loss. If I figure it out and grow a real portfolio in time that 3k would be the best $ I ever spent.

For AMC I'm still holding but tbh I'll bail out at the first run up to even $10, if it comes and do the same. Make it up elsewhere. 

You may consider doing the same, or at learning the fundamentals so this doesn't happen again. Great cheap courses on Udemy. Google search for coupon codes to get them for like $12. 

Just a suggestion.This is not financial advice. I think theaters are in for a rough decade, maybe their last, but I'm holding AMC as well. Covid restrictions will start lifting this summer, and you'll have a period where people are doing things they haven't been able to do, Marvel is releasing Black Widow, Wonder Woman probably gets rereleased, wouldn't be surprised to see Tenet get a rerelease, etc., and I think it'll get a nice spike off of that. I won't hold it in 2022, but buying now and selling later in the year is likely to pay off.",1612625054.0,450

Manage your hedge fund, with your yes men. Take your allowance from Daddy, and invest in. Take the ethics of business, shame and molest them. Contribute to inequality, harm the people, stress them.

More effective than an RH shutdown. When the corrupt mods got washed out & drowned, all the decent Redditors congregated, gathered around. Some sacrificed their presence here: martyrs vs. entitled clowns. Ironic sub, for selflessness, to take the champion's crown, at the end of the war, when the cavalry came to town.

Hope you enjoy your movie deals, and ego-driven feels. Credit with others as a human just rotted, and congealed. Your last bet is having enough cash to cover your back-stabbing ass, for real. How long did you think your conspiracy would remain concealed? The fat lady didn't just sing for you, she squealed.

This is a good day. I have to grin, and nod. All the effort, and intelligence, that countered these self-absorbed mods... I've learned more about stocks, which were confusing, and odd, on here for 30 minutes than a class back in Aug...

CEO's aren't impressive to me. One Redditor helped this sub exist, for FREE. Blew the whistle, when the vultures returned, to feed. Their return to this sub, something we need!

So to anyone involved...to anyone who had the decency to make sure this problem was solved: This world can be awful, and some think it revolves...around their egos, colossal, even though they lack balls, backbone, or competence. Quivering lips on their jaws. Subscribed this sub, because it proved to the WORLD, that Wall Street: It's flawed.

657,DD - Back to Business,"
Last week companies like PLTR are back up and trending in the right direction. (I do hold PLTR) I think the EV stocks are about to do the same again as this other sideshow levels out.

Company - Quantumscape - QS  

Product - a lighter, more efficient battery for EV's. Charges faster than a Tesla battery. Protected with Patents so this is not common technology. Gets about 85% charge in 15 mins which is amazing.

Virtually No Debt. The biggest liability on their last Nov Balance sheet was deferred underwriting expenses. 

Volkswagen owns 20% of the company so there is a big potential customer with skin in the game and who can offer vehicle manufacturer feedback and input. They paid $300M for this so its not a gimme to get a good partner. One of their Execs sits in the board.

Bill Gates is also an investor - like him or hate him dude is smart.

After the big GM and Ford announcements this EV thing is real now. Its not just a Tesla thing or the odd product out of the majors. Big money is being put towards product development. This could be an argument for jus going to buy Tesla but its an expensive stock and has the good already priced in. So trying to find others is the challenge. These guys don't have the issues a manufacturer of cars does. Battery technology will have uses outside of vehicles. So that's why I like this component.

Quantumscapes battery is not a full Lithium battery. They are solid state Lithium. Lithium isn't great for the environment but it is the future of batteries so smaller and more efficient is a bonus.

Downside: this is not in major production right now. Its a great technology but is not actively in vehicles. Read: No sales.

The recent sell off was probably due to over excitement and the insiders sold shares after the lock up. However the remaining 95% of insider and employee shares are locked up.

This is not likely a moon shot tomorrow as these things take a while to fully develop but the SPAC gave them a piss pot of cash for R&D.

Next earnings release is Feb 16. If you are feeling good, you can get in before then. If you want to be conservative, wait until this is public. I don't expect there to be any sales. This will be an update on the battery technology and if they have taken on any debt. The last release was a $0.20 loss per share. This is not an all in share and should only be considered if you have some spec space in your account. 

Do your own homework. Check out the company's web page, read some articles. See if the difference in the solid state battery technology versus Lithium Ion makes sense. Forbes has a negative article on the company but its all based on valuation from companies who are not emerging. 

My brokerage firm shows 6.34% short interest. I will look at that as positive for the direction and not a positive in anticipation of a squeeze.

Not a financial advisor. Just someone who enjoys Tendies and likes doing homework.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldyytx/dd_back_to_business/,"Dude. You leave out literally the most important part - they don’t expect production of the battery and revenue until 2025. 

Pass.

Edit: Forbes article that shreds the stock. There are so many EV and battery companies out there in market already. Check out Microvast for example. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/01/05/three-reasons-to-steer-clear-of-quantumscape-stock/amp/

Edit 2: you also realize that they have tech that at the rate of battery innovation may not even be innovative by 2025 right? Everyone else is also working towards solid state lithium-metal batteries too.Finally something other than shorted stocks. Didn’t even read but I appreciate itIm not feeling quantumscape at all. The whole thing look like kickstarter bullshit on roids.Thank you for your DD, glad to see some sort of return to normalcyWe doing DD again, now?Thanks for the DD but as another has commented they don't expect production for four more years. I'm holding off on that one.As they don’t have many catalysts in the short term, this may be a very good entry point to hold for long long term. Leaps may be a good play. Any good news(more partnerships, advancement in tech, earlier release date etc) and this shoots to the moon as I believe it’s way oversold.

The problem with the above is that you have to have an extreme amount of faith in this company as i believe they aren’t expecting production for another 3 years? Many other companies are in the same field and if they get beaten to the punch then the company basically becomes worthlessGoldman Sucks came out with an analysis with $42 price. Just after the stock was climbing back up to $50.

https://markets.businessinsider.com/analysts-opinions/quantumscape-corporation-registered-shs--a--neutral-750559I like QS, mainly because it made me a lot of money the first time around.

I do think solidstate batteries will be the future of EV, and it's also abundantly clear that full EV is the future of vehicles (and we are talking nearish future, i.e. before 2030).

It's still pretty expensive for not expecting any revenue until 2024, but whoever gets commercialised solid state right first is going to make a an absolute shit ton of money (we are talking hundreds of billions) which is probably why it's so expensive and QS have the best shot at it, they are years ahead in terms of the technology and have enough money to create a product.

Main risk is that they ecounter unresolvable issues in trying mass produce their cells which would turn the whole thing into vaporware, basically same risk you take on a pharma company with a promising drug after phase 1 for a disease with a huge TAM.

I started accumulating a little again last two weeks, v small position as it drifts down, i expect (and hope) it to continue to drift down over the next year or two. It will explode the moment they reveal a commercialised product.The 🐝 is wayyyy better. QS doesn’t have anything real till 2025",1612622811.0,36

Supposedly the admin stepped in and took care of the moderator situation, but since then, u/zjz still has not come back and the only post kept up are stupid worthless bullshit, while any worthwhile posts I try to read get deleted very quickly.

I'm not sure what is going on, but it's clear that it isn't kosher. It's beginning to look pretty convincingly like the mods are still compromised. I have no reason to believe they aren't, and more reasons than I can count to believe they are. and we still have not been given an explanation as to what actually went down as far as the mod coup d'étard. We were told that they couldn't discuss it yet but would give us details eventually, but it's clear that someone's just buying time while the shady shit continuesYo mods, blink twice if the SEC is your wife's boyfriend.Thus subreddit went from 95% pro-GME, to 95% negativity, to 95% memes.

666,Best Buy $BBY DD. Earnings play.,"TLDR: BBY Rocket Ship Emoji, Calls (2/19, 2/26, 3/19 115-120cs or a strike near their all time high of 123) and Shares

This is so similar to the other BB ticker DDs I did that most of it going to sound familiar. If you already bought BBY on accident this thinking it was BB or BBBY and need some reassurance, you're in the right place. First, going over my retarded investing tenets to make sure my dumb plays align with it:

Overall:
Everyone and their mom buys electronics at Best Buy.  This has accelerated to extremes over the last quarter, positioning BBY for a huge earnings blowout on 2/25.

It is a direct beneficiary of stimulus checks, and was upgraded by Bank of America with a 132, YES ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO, price target just two days ago.

BBY is 10$ under it's all time high and starting to moon.  Check the chart, retard.

Upside:

BBY has cash on hand, $5.1B to be exact (which doubled since COVID began, from $2.2B to $5.1B. See? What did I say?)

They grew online sales by 174%, AND store sales by 23%. They're being forcefully pivoted online, which is exactly what they NEEDED to do, so even if their leadership was dumb COVID has helped them. Additionally, every boomer is heading to Best Buy to set up their WFH setups with a blank check from their jobs that they can expense.

They surprised with an EPS of $2.04 last quarter vs $1.70 expected. Margins are only getting better as they can reduce benefits, track every minute of an employee's logged in time, and shut down stores / fire people without any public backlash due to COVID.

Remember how we all jacked off about GME console sales? BBY is BIGGER and sells more. Basically guaranteed revenue bump from this quarter that wasn't there last year, which will impress wall street because they're retarded like us and like when numbers go up. The website has crashed over and over due to video game demand. That sounds bad, but it's like with PTON being unable to fulfill orders... so many people want it that they're crashing the site.

They're still below their ATH of 123 from just 2 months ago and they've only been performing the same or better since then.

Most importantly in my mind, they are still undervalued because they didn't provide good guidance last quarter. Last quarter they beat every metric but the stock dropped from ATH of 123 to ~113 because they said Q4 sales likely wouldn't be as high due to their high Q3. Well guess what, the market is already pricing in a slow Q4 for every business. There's uncertainty in this stock because of that, yet think of it: how could they have messed up extra console sales and stree-free closure of unprofitable stores? I mean, they could, which I'll go over below.

Downsides:

Usually my largest gripe is with the people. In this case, CEO Corie Barry is a traditional ""okay"" CEO with a few scandals under her. If she were a really skilled CEO, Best Buy could've been one of the best internet retailers ALREADY. But I'm still going with BBY since COVID is basically forcing them online faster than she would've pushed them.
So let's recap so far:

An actual profitable business and growing online presence, with all the benfits of having cash on hand.

Uncertain guidance leading to wall street hesitance

Tailwinds (gov and economic) pushing them to greater profitability (not even including new console season).

I love this play and it's one of my sleepers. People should realize BBY is similar to GME, TGT, WMT, etc and will outperform it's ""brick and mortar"" expectations online.

Easy win play: Just buy shares if you're scared

**What’s an Orphan Medicinal Product?** Although you could google it, I’ll just let you know it offers an easier path to approval and financial incentives for the manufacturer, since the small patient population would prevent the drug from being financially viable otherwise.

**Speaking of stock price, remember ONCE from the table above?** They were acquired for 4 Billion for one approved therapy. Sidebar- a geene therapy for ocular indication was a smart strategic move because it ain’t hard to deliver to an eyeball (you inject into the eyeball and you’ve hit your target), and the biggest hurdle in geene therapy right now seems to be delivery. So they had a revenue geenerating product, and therefore should have been valued more than SGMO- makes perfect sense. What’s more interesting for us is that they also have a hemophilia A geene therapy, SPK-8011, just like SGMO. And just like Biomarin, the trial results are objectively inferior to SGMO’s. [Although the picture is tiny, you’ll have to squint at this crappy abstract page because I don’t have access to the ITSH abstracts in full.](https://abstracts.isth.org/abstract/phase-i-ii-trial-of-spk-8011-stable-and-durable-fviii-expression-for-2-years-with-significant-abr-improvements-in-initial-dose-cohorts-following-aav-mediated-fviii-gene-transfer-for-hemophilia-a/) Notice the factor levels in Phase 1/2 top out somewhere below 25 IU

^(In case the monke strong crowd was wondering, IU is International Units, which is a measurement of factor level normalized to the general population, where 100 IU would represent the mean factor levels of a large simple size of a non-hemophiliac patient population. Factor is weird- you really don’t need levels of 100 IU to prevent bleeds, which is good because all the geenetic therapies seem to produce levels of factor that wane over time.) 

**SGMOs Phase 1/2 factor levels went to about…ohhhh…**[***more than 100*** for those that received an extended steroid taper (see slides 11 and 12, one of those lucky bastards got up to like 175)](https://investor.sangamo.com/static-files/3238ff23-9b25-4d56-b16c-f603cc6c63e0). KILLIN IT. Of note, Truist issued a “Quick Thoughts” report on Dec 8th with a price target of $23 for SGMO following these results, and it only mentioned the Heme A program results, not any of the 16 others pipeline ventures SGMO has going on. WF has a price target of $36.

**And now for something completely different:** [a patent application to edit mitochondrial genomes](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=154288&pt=msg&mid=21569486) . 

**Anything coming up, event-wise?** Aside from the stuff in previous articles, [and this great timeline spaddy posts occasionally on IV,](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=154554&pt=msg&mid=21603746) SGMO usually has their full year conference call near the end of February, and they like to make big announcements around that time. FWIW, someone has been buying a LOT of February calls. Maybe SGMO is going to partner with someone diabetes-focused to treat Type 1 Diabetes, since it’s autoimmune and only a natural target for T-Cell therapy. But that’s just wild speculation I was hoping to manifest into existence.

Please do your own research and Due Diligence before investing into anything. This is literally me reading news and reports and summarizing for my WSB autists. This DD is my personal opinion and for entertainment purposes only.**

&#x200B;

**Q4 Earnings -**

Based on the report published on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/return-capital-employed-overview-snap-153556988.html), SNAP reported Q4 sales of $911.32 million and earnings fell to a loss of $97.24 million. This was a decrease of 42% from last quarter which is obviously good because in the last quarter they lost $167.86 million in earnings. They were also able to beat the analyst expectations of EPS by 0.02/share. This is why the stock went up 10% after the earnings. They posted strong Q4 results and were able to beat all the expectations.

&#x200B;

**Analysis**

The SNAP is little concerned over the Apple's IDFA policy and because of that they expect low revenue in the following quarter. The increase in users and revenue mainly occurred due to coronavirus pandemic. More and more companies started spending money on the social media apps to promote their products instead of Televisions or movie theatres. As coronavirus pandemic comes to an end, I expect decline in users and decline in revenues for the company. The brands would then start spending ad money on movie theatres, restaurants etc.

&#x200B;

SNAP's competitors Instagram & Facebook has also seen growth in number of users. As digital ad budget continues to grow, there's no guarantee that they would all flow to the SNAP. I personally find ads on SNAP more annoying than I do on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. I expect Facebook & Instagram to collect more ad dollars compared to Snapchat over the period of time.

The stock was trading at 25$ ish during October 2020 and it went up 193% over the span of 6 months.

&#x200B;

SNAP has a good presence in developed markets, however I think it faces difficulty when trying to enter the developing countries.

&#x200B;

I also expect a little bit of pullback from the rally of 10% on Friday. I expect the stock to trade around 55$ in few upcoming weeks.

People kept on buying 40P and it went up and up and up.Hate to tell that Cathy and ARK buying and it will be hard to make that put print. Just my retarded opinion

I was long and selling covered calls that got exercised as it ran up to much to roll smartly. That was like $30 ago. I also got back on earnings day and doubled at $52 in AH when it shot down. Not a big conviction play w less than a full position for me, but long term holdlr. 

I just have been printing selling puts in this market and certain stonks. I would have sold you that put for example.

I’ve not seen a better community around and more sure fire play anywhere on this sub.  The company are open about wanting a buyout and reasonable estimates for BO start as low as 5B, giving it a share price of $35, and as high as 15B, giving a share price of $105.

676,Congratulating people who sold and also holding is a contradiction,"People who bought at like 11 dollars and sold at 400 are the ones who MADE you guys bagholders. I don't have anything against them; make your money. But the way the system works, if you want the squeeze to happen, EVERYONE (or a vast vast majority) have to hold. 

Like a week ago, people would be hated on for having 420 sell limits. And theoretically, that is true, because selling will drive the price down. But people DID sell, and those people made bank and are ""paper hands"".

The people with insane amounts of money are the most likely to be paper hands and sell once they make a profit. If you're a whale with 100k invested, you have so much more to lose than someone who YOLOed 400 dollars and can just hold forever. It sucks WAY more to see 100k go to 50k than 400 to 200.

Because of this contradiction, it is inherently extremely difficult to create a short squeeze because people want to reduce their risks and make money. I don't blame them. But you guys are hilarious congratulating the sellers at 300-400 (if you actually still are holding) because they literally swindled you lmao.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldwmxc/congratulating_people_who_sold_and_also_holding/,"Selling at the top after a massive fast runup is not 'paper hands'.

Just because you bought into the bullshit hype that the GME gravy train would never stop rolling as long as all of WSB held onto their shares, doesn’t justify the blame you’re now placing on the people who traded this smart and cautiously. The stock isn’t tanking because the retail investors who took home a nice profit sold their shares, the stock is tanking because the short interest, which was the only catalyst for the upward movement, is gone. You guys can call it conspiracy all you want. You can say the numbers are being manipulated, but the short interest is gone. No more short squeeze. I understand this was an expensive lesson for you and many others but I find it pretty ridiculous that you would now shift your blame on the people who actually made the right play here.hmmm... okOGs saw a good play and banked on it when they should have, don't compare professional or even amateur investors with the 95% of this sub which were filled in a week by absolute mongoloids that smelled free gibs and made it about a ""cause"".

Wallstreetbets moved the markets in a significant measure. And has never happened before, that retail traders an a significant quantity have moved the markets and nearly destroyed a (semi?-)'big player' (like melvin).

If theres a next crash in this decade, the media (which one can take over by owning the majority of their stock) will probably point the finger on a social media community like wallstreetbets, **even for the case of some other force implying the crash.**

682,Why $SPCE is due a 60%+ surge in next 10 days and HUGE SHORT SQUEEZE.,"$SPCE (Virgin Galactic) has been one of the best performing non-meme stocks this year and it is due to surge another +60% in the next 10 days that will precede a huge short squeeze. I will explain more below.

&#x200B;

**VIRGIN GALACTIC:**

Virgin Galactic is a space tourism company that is moments away from FAA approval which will enable it to begin commercial operations this year. Virgin Galactic sells tickets for $250,000 per person that gives you a plan ride to the edge of space and 6 minutes of weightless bouncing around in the space ship looking back at earth.

&#x200B;

**TEST FLIGHT IS THE KEY:**

February 13th marks the opening of SPCE flight window for their final 2 powered test flights to space. Weather permitting of course, this flight will take place this weekend or on the soonest perfect weather following day.

SPCE's last test flight FAILED. After the failed ignition, their plane glided safety back down to base, proving their safety systems worked as expected. After diagnosis, it was found the software responsible for igniting the rocket system had failed. Virgin Orbit also suffered a failed launch late last year due to the exact same problem.

***Why should we be excited about this test flight if the last one failed?***

Virgin Orbit since corrected the software issue and their next launch was a success! Proving the Virgin rocket engineers are capable of fixing this issue and leaving us very confident they have applied the same fix to the SPCE rocket system.

With this successful test flight, SPCE will gather all the data needed for full FAA approval needed to begin commercial operations. Let's not forget that this will not be their first successful test flight to space either!

This means the successful test flight could see Richard Brandon fly on the first commercial space flight as soon as late March.

When the stock was at $30, market analysts predicted a successful test flight could see the stock reach $54, which would equate to a +60% move.

**The stock is currently $54.+60% increase will see the stock reach $86 IN ONE DAY based on successful powered test flight.**

&#x200B;

**SHORT SQUEEZE:**

According to MarketBeat, SPCE short interest is a fantastic 71% of the float to the tune of 1.6 BILLION DOLLARS.

Many options calls expired on 5th February, meaning Monday they will likely need to buy their shares. The stock is up +22% in just the last trading week and +128% YTD. Shorts are getting very nervous.

Successful test flight will see a huge surge in price as investors flood in to the company as it moves from speculative to viable commercial operations.

With 71% float shorted, we will see an absolutely epic short squeeze when shorts will have no choice but to cover their positions once on the success of the test flight.

&#x200B;

**WHAT'S THE PLAY:**

This all comes down to the success of the test flight.

**If you are betting the test flight will be a success (as I am), get in before February 13th when the flight window opens.**

If you are betting the test flight will fail, short the stock before February 13th.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldw6aq/why_spce_is_due_a_60_surge_in_next_10_days_and/,"Great Pitch, great attitude, but you came into the tank with too high of a valuation. Your company doesn't even have any sales! 

For me though, you used the phrase ""short squeeze"" making you sound like total fucking amateur clown, and for that reason... I'm out!This is an OG meme stock and there’s reason to believe it just squeezedOn the day Branson flies this thing, I’m taking the day off work so I can have my finger on the sell button in case he blows upAnd paying $250k to fly to the outer edge of space isn’t near as dangerous as this stonk optionThis reminds me of that episode of Billions where the CEO dies on the rocket and the hedge funds cash in on shorts.If you believe the stock will move so significantly in either direction based on the outcome of the test flight, buy a straddle and you win as long as it moves in either direction enough..You seem to be confused in this post. You say the last test failed, but that the changes they made led to a launch success. I'm not buying it.

The problem with this entire thing is that Blue Origin is fighting for a large market share, and now even SpaceX (who are due their first fully commercial ride shortly).

Just chucking 'short squeeze' is a desperate attention grab imo. Not sure this DD is worth much I'm afraid. Your entire conclusion is based on the next test being a success (when they have a track record of failing) and that the second it passes the test every shorter will have to buy back their position because logic. This isn't how a short squeeze traditionally works. Normally a squeeze is when the brokers demand their shares back and the shorters have to buy all at once or in the space of a single trading day - company performance is not usually related to squeezes in that context.

Good luck with your bet, I hope you win!The award for least insightful DD goes to...Lets be honest, this is an OG meme STONK.  But I’m in on shares anyways 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀This is the way...Holding 9086 shares. I am my wife's fucking boyfriend 🚀🚀🚀",1612611924.0,72

What makes it unique is is that not only do you have Americans doing it against the hedgefunds but you have middle class members of society coming together from other countries, to band together as a singular unit to say, ""Hey, you dont need so much money that you can bet on businesses to die."" Then you have stories of people taking the money and buying food, video games for kids, and donating to people in need..
 Its beautiful and what makes it great is we dont have a leader, we arent planning revolts, we are using an internet forum to educate people on the stock market who are then deciding, we wanna bet on the hedgefunds to fail, to fail against the will of the regular citizens banding together to decide, we had enough of your corporate greed. We arent a group, we are a mindframe and its hard to kill something that doesnt have a face.You cant extort something without a name. We are one, we are all!

688,MSTR - Microstrategy,"MSTR has alot of Rule#4, enough that their stock essentially tracks it.

It is up 340% the last 3m, 89% the last month, 31% the last week.

Call options are expensive, my only regret is I wish I had more than 4 shares @ $500. 

The only reason I would invest in MSTR is if your broker, like mine (WeBull) doesn’t allow rule#4 purchases.

MSTR will continue to rise over time, hopefully at the same pace because MSTR is a stock, and stocks only go up.

Today, though, MSTR trades at an insane premium to the underlying asset which it tracks. It's something like 60% overvalued, which is way more than its core business intelligence operations are worth.

It could work as a trade in the right circumstances, but I think a stock like $RIOT or $MARA that similarly tracks that asset and doesn't have options starting at $10K+ is the better play for almost everyone.

Just my take; I love what MSTR is doing.",1612610816.0,0
689,PSA to newer members of WSB.,"I want to clarify a few things to some newer members.  You have taken a few jokes we make seriously and it will cause you to lose money. 

First, FOMO is an extremely bad reason to buy a stock or options. If you have to every ask “is it too late?” It is too late. Don’t ever buy a stock after it has rocketed up to ATH. 

This was a very very standard but of advice until GME made it’s crazy run. Now it seems like the norm. It’s not. It never was, and it never will be. GME is a once in a lifetime run. You will very likely never see another one. 

Second, diamond hands. Pretty much the same story. Diamond hands was seen as a very very stupid thing to do. Anytime you nailed even a 2 bagger we would always always tell you to sell it all, or at the very least sell half to secure some profit and hold the other half as a gamble. 

Another note on diamond hands. If you are not familiar with organized pump and dump groups please read up on them. They create runs on a stock, then convince other people to buy it while they sell off securing profits. 

The 3 biggest ways to spot a pump and dump is 1 fomo, and 2 they tell you have diamond hands. (Prior to diamond hands they would say “it might dip, but that’s expected! Don’t sell it will go up!” Lastly they will always sell it as a sure thing. No stock is ever a sure thing. 

New people that witnessed GME are making these pump and dumps extremely easy to pull off. 


My last bit of advice, bag holding isn’t a sound strategy. Holding a stock because you are down on it and only because you are down on it is stupid. Plain and simple. 

Only ever hold on to a stock if you really think it’s going to go up. (With good reason.) you can sell, take what money is left and buy something else that will return a better profit. When you lose, ask yourself, if I didn’t own this stock right now, would I buy it at its current price having seen it drop? If the answer is yes, then hold it, if the answer is I would cum in my pants for a chance to buy in at this price having no losses! Then double the fuck down and buy more. 

I have been on wsb for almost 10 years. I learned to trade here. I don’t have a job and trade full time for my income. There are some very very smart people here, it is up to you to find those people and learn from them while ignoring or laughing at the retards losing money for the memes. 

Lastly, inverse wsb is a very legit strategy, think about that. Doing the exact opposite of the front page of wsb has good returns. (fscomeau, I’ll miss you, you glorious bastard.)


Edit: someone rightfully pointed out that the inverse wsb strategy has gotten its ass royally handed to it in the last 8 months. So maybe I’m that old guy that is struggling to keep up with change.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldvw8m/psa_to_newer_members_of_wsb/,"FOMO is tricky man. Look at Tesla, look at GME when it hit $80, there a bunch more examples where you can buy in early hype and make a bunch of money.

Chances are, most people here are retarded like me and haven’t had much luck finding stuff on their own. 

If you read a DD or a gain post and there are still major catalysts coming for a stock, or if the big gainer is holding for specific reasons, look them up and decide for yourself if there’s potential.

There could be, and there usually is.Thank you for writing this. I've been here for 6 or 7 years myself and it has been really really strange to see this sub explode into my
real life. Younger coworkers are all in group chats trying to catch money from GME or AMC and I saw a Popeye's commercial that said ""Get Your Tendies At Popeyes"".

As fun and retarded as WSB has always been, I always thought it was one of the best and most pure subreddits on Reddit .

I think that may change for a while. 


PLTR $50 2/16I will put in what I have learned.

options despite what people might tell you are actually safer than shares they pay out 10 to one usually and you can only lose the amount of money that you pay for the contract, so you have limited downside and they expire so you don't have to worry about getting married to a stock.

 They are infinitely better than day trading on margin which only gives you a day or two to be right before you lose all your money to a margin call. Yes if options expire worthless you lose the amount you paid for the contract but that's all you lose.

Always sell your call options before they expire or you will get exercised and end up with either a hundred shares or owe your broker more money than you have if it's an expensive stock

Don't buy call options if they're crazy inflated. If it's 3 weeks ago, It's a good idea to buy a call option in GameStop if it's $300 for a monthly, it's not a good idea to buy a call option in GameStop if it's $14,500 for a weekly (this happened) you have to make back the cost of buying the contract before you're profitable on your calls. 

Also if someone tells you to buy leaps which are long-term calls make sure to run the numbers sometimes it's so expensive that you'd actually make more money just buying shares.

You will lose a bunch of money when you first start trading options at first it is impossible not to. 

buy monthlies, not weeklies on call options and buy 1to5 calls per each company that you're investing in. Buy a bunch of different companies dont yolo on one thing.

yoloing all your money on something is not a good idea unless you are at such a loss that you're like 'what's the worst that can happen?' sometimes that works out but usually not.

invest in like 5 to 10 companies with calls you just need to profit more than you lose and your account goes up I know that sounds simple but don't expect all of your options to expire in the money. 

Wall Street bets is really good at finding stocks that will go up but they're usually not right on the timing, so buy monthlies not weeklies and if you have no idea how long it's going to take just buy shares.

news often takes about 3 weeks to reflect on a stock price. so if a company is called out for being a fraud lets say there's usually an initial reaction that you probably won't catch and then about three weeks later it'll start to dip but for three weeks it'll go up or trade normally and you'll be like 'what's going on?' but it's just because most people aren't really paying attention it takes a while for the news to get around

Wall Street bets is never right when it comes to the general direction of the market. Every time that Wall Street bets says that the whole market's going to crash or that the whole market is going to go through the roof I do the opposite because they never call that right. 

Don't short anything right now, stonks only go up. especially during the pandemic.

Use fidelity they have kind of a weird platform that has calculation problems all the time and their phone service is terrible and sometimes their platform doesn't work at all but they didn't limit anybody from buying or selling shares during the gamestop run up so that's who I'd recommend for now.

I'm not a financial advisor. This is just some stuff that I've learned I could be wrong what do I know.And every new WSB member should watch this.

690,Tip for all the Hollywood WSB / GME films / documentaries,"Hello lurking film producers / fellow: ""I want easy cash with minimal effort"", apes.

Open ""WSB: To the moon and back TM (c)"" with a 2001: A Space Odyssey pastiche - instead of the usual black monolith, have it made from hundreds of boxes of crayons, which one ape prods, and then knocks over.

To The Moonwatcher then starts to feed on all the waxy goodness he has found.

Have a sub-plot featuring gourd buying / having the boat getting delayed and the gourds slowly rotting.

Another sub-plot: a member of WSB slowly becomes more and more ill over the course of the film, and they have no idea why.

At least their stonks continue to 🚀🚀🚀, so they can still purchase wax crayons to feast on.

Have cuts / transitions using dire space-themed special effects. Eg: rockets made using painted washing up bottles, child-painted planets/ moons, etc.

The film's climax needs a 300-inspired HOLD sequence, using the most inappropriate people / cheap ape costumes.

This is purely speculation and is more than likely to have never happened. I just like having fun with the “what if’s.”                        

There may be an even smarter move for him to make money while holding the shares... I think a restricted stock loan might be legal? I’m not sure what the interest rates were for loaning shares at the peak, but I would be curious to know. In my opinion, his gif would make a lot of sense if he could use the interest rates from share lending to buy more shares at extremely devalued prices(not sure how long you have to loan the shares out to get paid, and if the interest rates move with the prices of the stock or if it is fixed). It would be a flood(not sure if it is even legal for RC to do it) of possibly 12% of total shares hitting the market(for short sellers). The main variables in my opinion would be legality in if he would be allowed to loan the shares to short sellers, if the interest rate received on the loan fluctuates with price of the stock, the duration of the share loan before being allowed to be recalled(while still collecting interest), and how low can the stock truly go?

1. How does a hedge fund stay alive after sustaining billions in losses? 

I've heard rumors of them selling their long positions to cover their shorts, having time to pay for the shares they shorted, and receiving a loan from Citadel. I'm assuming they've played both sides of the trade and took out new short positions based on recent prices.

2. If they are going under, then how long could it take? Are there historical examples we can point to, I.e. late 90s/2008. 

3. There was a rumor that a NY pension fund is affiliated with Melvin. Is this true? If so, what the hell would happen if an entire hedge fund gambles a pension fund away? Hoping they're smart enough to diversify their clients assets. Any historical examples we can point to?

4. I heard a rumor (yes, yet another rumor) that multiple hedge funds went under/sustained huge losses. Does anyone have specific insight into this?

5. Do we know generally or specifically what securities/assets that Melvin and other related hedge funds have/are invested in? I know we don't have much transparency in terms of investments in the US, but may be there's a well hidden publicly facing investor report that their clients receive. 

6. If we don't know the assets they're invested in, how did we manage to find out that they were behind the GME short? 

7. Do we know of a country with disclosure laws that require individuals/hedge funds to disclose their positions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldvchr/shouldnt_melvin_go_under_by_now/,"There is no telling when they would go under.

706,Don't buy anymore GME or AMC (especially if you're new) unless you got money to burn or are too retarded to read this. Just hold.,"This message is more orientated to new folk.

Its going to continue to drop so wait for that shit to go down to the dollar. We don't know if there's gonna be another squeeze by how the hedgies and RH screwed us over the first time. Them having all the bananas probably have found other ways to screw us over by now. Even Mark's AMA had a lot of ""next time you'll come back smarter"" phrasing as in the shit that happened here was phenomenal but most likely will have failed.

If it does fail, at least some people were early to buy nuggies. But people buying now is your own risk and not a meme. If it does fail, people well sell with well cash made. When that happens all the late apes will be left to dry for ""long term investing"" to hide the fact they literally lost thousands. And while losing thousands is great for meme purposes on this sub, all the newcomers are gonna be staring at the charts 24/7 never coming off the toilet.

If all you people who lost a ton of money do get gains somehow (because remember, people already HAVE gains, they just lost some because of the hedgies and want it back or some already cashed out with multi tendies) then consider yourselves lucky because these stocks are dropping and will continue to drop for a while and not everyone will have diamond hands.

Its hard to keep a meme going for so long. The memes are the only thing really pushing this. Once the meme dies, so does the volume. All the inexperienced traders don't know all the other smooth brained people are used to losing will continue to trade like normal, and they'll have nothing left but to stare at their loss cause of a meme and their poor timing to jump on a a bandwagon all late.

On a lighter note. If you already own GME or AMC don't sell yet, there's a good chance we'll at least get a small squeeze. Just don't be an actual retard and lose your life savings over this and keep buying when it hasn't finished dropping. And if you do buy.. Diamond hands. Diamond hands. Diamond hands. Not for the sake of the stock but for your own sake..

713,Outlining the problems with Option hedging narrative,"Hello WSB, honest new poster here. My experience is in commodities so I am actively looking for someone to correct me if I am wrong. I honestly have never worked with something that can be short squeezed, so listen to the comments not my post.

I’ve read the theories of the hedge funds using options to reduce their shorts, if I understand correctly and over simplified:

Hedge funds Sell Call options to a Market Maker, this gives the Market maker the right to hedge their length by selling Synthetic length, there the Hedge funds buy the length and voila shorts are closed, SI reduces. (Previously we were the recipients of these fake stocks, which is how shorts got over 100%)

However the hedge funds are left short options, which basically started this whole thing. What is not discussed enough is what strike of options we think they used, which is where I think there is 4 broad scenarios. 

They sell Out of The Money calls, eg strike $800(OTM):
This would have very low delta, hence the hedge funds would need to sell like 5 times their short to get enough length. And if the squeeze ever got to $800 then they would be 5 times more squeezed past that point.

They sell In The Money calls, eg strike $4(ITM):
This would have effectively 100% delta letting them hedge fully quickly, but in reality wouldn’t change any dynamics, the call would almost entirely act as an already exercised short, making them short again unless price actually falls below $4.

They sell At the Money calls, strike = that days price(ATM):
This would have about just over 50% delta so they would need to sell double their position to fully hedge. And if they did this man did they win so far. BUT they would have then doubled down on their position, the next time a squeeze happens it would happen twice as hard.

They bought Puts at any strike:
This would have the same effect with MM hedging and Hedge Funds rebuying the length. But without too much detail, this would mean the Hedge Funds are paying More premium, increasing their daily costs and meaning the squeeze or fall better happen soon.

TLDR: If I understand correctly, Options to reduce SI is a way to hide but actually would make a future squeeze more prominent. This is honestly the reason I am holding ~75 stock at ~200 entry. And as I said at the start, I feel I am myself wrong so why would you listen to me to make financial decisions. Read the smartest looking comment below and make your own decisions.
Also please link to the smart WSB articles explaining Short Squeeze, Short ladder attacks and Option Hedging that I can’t find at the moment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lduv2m/outlining_the_problems_with_option_hedging/,"Good DD.

it hit 1.7x i sold it and i told my partner, from now on i make the sole trading judgement. :)Trade war. If you know you know. One tweet blew up my account. 

MU and RAD. I still have nightmares, another another blown up account. 

I think I still have screenshots on my computer, 37k total losses between those. Will edit post if I have them.2018, we all know what happened. 10k->15k->0k in a week.Honestly I think it’s better to lose a bit in the beginning. If you get lucky in the beginning and hit a stock that rockets 100% in one day, you’ll probably think you got it all down but a couple weeks from then there’s a possibility you’ll be down big. Most successful accounts I’ve seen look like 📉📈📉📉📉📈📉📈📈📈📉📈📈📈📈 if they make it past the first couple monthsMy biggest fuckup was playing spy weeklies around the election. Put in a little more of my account than I was actually ready to lose. I made a lot of money, I lost more. Lesson learned, don’t fuck with weeklies unless it’s a complete yolo. 

My most retarded move was when I accidentally bought instead of sold 5 options in the morning when the bid ask spread was wide and I was dicking around waiting for it to tighten. I spent $700 on what was ultimately about $350 worth of option calls. I already had 5 at a lower price so that averaged me down quite a bit and the next day the price went up and I broke even. But I could have made a few hundred instead. Lesson learned, get better sleep, don’t dick around on orders, and double check before you put them through.Put about $1000 into cheasapeak energy when it was like 50c a share. They did a stock split to stay listed and the price dropped nearly half and I panic sold and lost around $500.

They price went up a week or two later, and if I'd stayed in I would have made like 3k. Taught me some valuable lessons.
 
Also bought at the top of Xpeng (yep, about $70 a share). Averaged it down some but still wound up losing about another $500 to get out of the deal 

Thankfully over time I've made all that money back and am in the green now profit wise, but these were probably my two biggest set backs",1612604995.0,12

724,What I did not like about Gamestop as a customer,"The value proposition with selling and buying used games was not there for me.  It always felt lopsided.  Gamestop will pay you let’s say $3 dollars for a game, then turn around and sell it for $30.

You could argue that Gamestop’s cost of managing inventory justifies the markup.  This did not change anything for me as a customer.  I turned to eBay instead.  I felt I got a truer market value with my exchanges.  Now even though I always bought and never sold on eBay a seller gets the most profits, not eBay.  An individual seller benefiting the most.  Power to the players Gamestop, don’t forget!

Hopefully the buyer got a truer market value as well instead of a set price that probably doesn’t sell until it goes on sale or worse clearance.  Potentially wasting resources required by Gamestop to manage the inventory and floor space.

If Gamestop could eliminate this obstacle, now that I’m diamond FUCKING hands, I could see myself using Gamestop for my used video game exchanges.  Even selling this time.  I could see how Gamestop could use it’s store fronts and name recognition (ape t-shirts anyone??) to leverage itself as the premier destination for the used gaming market to even rival eBay.  Well it fucking better or I’m never getting my tendies.

Now onto the stuff I absolutely loved about Gamestop as a customer.  Midnight motherfucking launches.  Battlefield 3, Destiny, The Order 1886.  I think it was just those three but I had a blast.

You can argue it’s all digital now so the days of actually having to go to the store is done but at the moment, the used market is limited to physical.  Some folks also just prefer physical media.  I know I feel this way about books.

And that’s it unfortunately.  I still love gaming, since the Atari 2600.  I just now purchase digitally so I don’t have to worry about the literal baggage but I think physical media will always have a place.  I still have my N64 and Dreamcast.  Maybe if the conditions are right, I’d even let go of my beloved Dreamcast collection in very good used condition with four controllers fishing rod arcade stick and two official light guns.

Just sell them on eBay for the full value. It’s your fault if you take $3 for a $30 game.So you would buy a game for $60 and GameStop would only give you $3 when you wanted to sell it later?

At 11:00 and 16:30 the price *and* volume suddenly spiked **a lot**. Is this proof that the shorts are still up and being covered slowly and steadily in multiple small bursts rather than one huge spike?,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldu1nz/are_the_shorts_covering_slowly_in_multiple_small/,"Look at it.

NOTHING LINKED BESIDES MEMES. AND NO POST HISTORY. TROLLLLL.

DO NO LET THIS IDIOT TRICK YOU INTO SELLING.I think every time you see a heavy volume churn supporting the stock, that’s short covering.  I’m no expert, but if the stock is being driven down and millions of shares start trading so that the stock stops falling, one of two things is happening.

1.  Sufficient paper hands have been herded to the slaughter

2.  A HFT on the long side is supporting the stop at a given price (maybe because they want their options to be in the money or something)

I think 1 is a lot more likely, especially since RH and other brokers had crippled retail buying.Sus afYes they are... it took too long and the media attention only worsened the situation. I guess we won't see 300$ for some weeksYesYeah, some are. For sure.

If they got in at $5 it's smart to cut their losses before it gets out of control again and they get margin called.

If they got in at $400 it's smart because it's unlikely it's going much lower, so might as well lock in their profits.

The important thing to remember though, is that institutions own MORE than 100% of the issued shares, so it is mathematically impossible for all the shorts to cover unless they sell. And why would they sell if they have access to *infinite* profit opportunity.

For every short share that gets covered, the corresponding long position just goes poof, and no longer exists anymore.

So the more they cover, even in small batches, the fewer people out there have shares to sell to them.",1612604457.0,0

At this point they only have one option, convince enough people to buy so they can unload their bags onto them.

Go ahead downvote me for stating the truth. After all the reason, you mob attack any comments that seeks to discredit gme is because the you are so acutely aware that the shares you hold are worth fractions of what you paid. Further, the demand has fizzed out so much that any differing views would ultimately reduce the chances of breakeven to nil.I wish you’d take your bra off your chest instead. What’s your OnlyFans?taxes

i think only 3k of gains per year can be over written by losses per year?Exactly. There’s plenty of volatile stocks for momentum trading that aren’t constantly manipulated with mass hysteria. 

The daily threads on GME resulted in more emotional decision making because of the social proof and sense of belonging people got. Ultimately most rational people (myself included) would have sold at the top were it not for the constant “$5k is not a meme posts”. Ultimately it’s my fault for getting caught up in the excitement and I’ll take my loss like a man. 

I’m going to make every penny back but intend to do it without putting a cent into GME. 

Ultimately if the fabled short squeeze happens and I buy it at say $120 it doesn’t matter because I’ll have a specific cut off point and a moving stop loss to prevent me being a compete retard again. 

What it’s made me realise is once I start a trade,  to avoid any discussion of it on social media and just focus on the charts.Fuck you dont need your financial adviceIf interest rates on completely safe investment paid anything I would hold them, there is a chance, however tiny that GME stock could destroy my retirement, I am buying and holding it to offset loses if that happens

Spending a lot of time online now is just normal and every fucking boring idiot has a profile on every social media site.

Am I wrong?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldtujj/what_does_120_of_float_shorted_mean/,"Means that every reason we thought a squeeze was coming is identical now to then. The rest is the emotional roller coaster the TV sent every one on.There are no current numbers to begin with, they come out on the 9th and only two times per month. They also don't show when those shorts are due, nor at which price they were shorted, nor if they are covered with options. I would be surprised if it isn't even 200 % shorted by now, because it was definitely shorted over 400.The float is the amount of available stocks to trade. If the shorts are over 100%, that means that they are shorting more stocks that are actually available.It means the game is rigged against us that financial institutions can short more shares than available and our king DFV gets investigated and not them.Even that number is manipulated, my guess would be that the si is even higher. Float = fifty something million shares, there are 120% of that fifty something million shares number being sold short.It’s a rare financial thing

744,Story time,"The year is 3069

The 1% is primarily made up of the descendants of the shareholders of Gamestop before the stock went parabolic for the fifteenth time. 

After it was clear no one was selling, the share price hit $24,000 in 2021. Then continued on a divine ascent for the next 2 years, topping 3.5 billion a share. 

Still the share holders did not sell. 

It was at this time, GameStop decided to do something incredible. They released a 10,000 share offering. The shorts being forced to buy back in now that stocks were available instantly made GameStop the most valuable company in the world by millions of times any other competitor. GameStop then immediately bought every business in the world and announced a 1% quarterly dividend. 

Within 10 years all holders of GameStop shares would be wealthy enough to replace not only their hands with diamonds, but also every member of their family’s as well. 

Overall not much changed beyond this. You could still eat at a GameStop Subway or a GameStop Jersey Mike’s. You could even find some GameStop Quiznos still around, as no company could ever go bankrupt again.

with that being said though this is a lot of people's first time learning about the market. learn *for yourself* rather than from this sub, theres a few good places to start. 1) read the book Stock Investing For Dummies, *somewhat* outdated but the fundamentals are forever. easy to grasp the concepts. Also Warren Buffet said the best book about investing is called *The Intelligent Investor* by Benjamin Graham. Lengthy, but worth it. 2) youtube deep dives on specific mechanics for trading (low risk investor? learn about ETF's, mutual funds, index's, etc., or want to know what the fuck options are? youtube rabbit holes are your friend.) 3) experience the market yourself. youre already doing this, gets you familiar with what the fucks going on. you can learn about limit orders and trailing stops all you want but it doesn't amount to shit without hands on experience with the market. e.g. you can learn about music theory your whole life without ever touching an instrument. but then what the fuck you learn for? 4) get the fuck off of RobinHood. you cannot trust them with your hard earned (and lost) money. 5) learn your relationship with investing. put your money where you believe it belongs. $GME to the fucking moon, but the attention around the stock is  extremely risky and very possibly guided by others belief, rather than your own, (unless following #5) in where their money belongs.

753,It's easier to short a 400$ stock than to short a 15$ stock.,"I feel like most people took their profits on $GME because it DID squeeze. It wasn't a gamma squeeze because it is NOT the same as the $VW stock.  Because in that case, Porche owned like 80% of the shares, and Porche it's a UNIT, it's a company, 1 person can coordinate it. But because we are a lot of people and you can NEVER know what someone will do, especially on the internet. It probably won't happen again. If you really want to see something happening you should take all the stocks talked about here in some order and take some profits from each of them. Because I feel like the other stocks didn't squeeze, not even once. They look like some P&Ds. If you really wanted to squeeze again $GME, you would probably have to go with it again to 500$ and actually hold. But such a run up again doesn't seem feasible in my view.

Lots more people bought in at a high price, meanwhile they doubled down, used a bailout, brokers and blind regulators to force the price downwards making even more back.


While some on here made good money (the original guys buying at 18-70 average per share) the vast majority here will have lost.The whole thing was just a classic pump and dump.It was game over when RH stopped trading in GME just as it was heading to $500. The hedge funds were let off the hook and they are out for blood now. Dirty tricks.  But these shylocks having been doing this a long time. Look up war is a racket by general smedley butler.Post this on r/GME.r/gmeThat 460 rally was the squeeze the Christmas is gone 
Hope the bag is not too heavyHedge funds won. Dead serious. Now pls fuck off with those stocks.What are my opinions?  
The squeeze is over. Zoom out the chart.  
Most of the og wsbers already took profits.  
The new guys are paying for all the losses hedgefunds took when they shorted it from 400s.Ok, since you're not another pump & dump chump mouthbreather screaming BUY THE DIP! DIAMOND HANDS RETARDS!... I'll indulge you...  Because I don't mind having an honest discussion with someone.  But there's no point doing so with those other fuckwads; they don't want honest discussion, they want to hype people up on emotion to buy more and pump it so they can profit.  
  
The squeeze was squoze already, or it was never real; just a happy coincidence of shorts, hype on here, media attention, and big institutional investors getting in on the action using us as cover.  
VW was never a great comparison to GME.  VW had a very small number of coordinated holders.  GME had thousands, tens of thousands, or millions of small fish.  Despite what they said, a lot sold along the way taking profits - as they should have.  
  
I know CNBC is hated by the GME crowd, and well I don't like em that much either, but this article actually has some pretty good info supplied by quite a few different sources.  It suggests that we played a much smaller role than people here would like to believe.  Also suggest retail were one of the biggest sellers of GME.  
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/05/gamestop-mania-may-not-have-been-the-retail-trader-rebellion-it-was-perceived-to-be-data-shows.html  
  
The SI doesn't support shorts closing - that ignores shorts closing and re-shorting at higher levels, being replaced with new shorts, etc.  nevermind that the SI info being thrown around is old by the time it's released, AND people are throwing around numbers from different sources interchangeably.  I saw 70%, 50%, 120% and 292% all being thrown out by the hype train idiots, all within 1-2 days.  
  
The volume doesn't support that - there are off exchange trades, dark pools, backroom deals that would explain shorts covering without the volume necessarily showing in real time.  
  
If we hold they'll HAVE to pay WHATEVER WE WANT - LOL no.  First, you can't get more money than they have.  If you bankrupt them, their assets will get liquidated and distributed to preferred creditors first, and the brokers/share owners they borrowed from if anything's left, and their clients if anything after that is left.  I could have the order there wrong, but the gist is the same.  
If their broker, or the broker that lent them the shares goes bankrupt because they're on the hook after the HF went down; same thing.  In the end, the owners of the shares know they would never get an insane market price of over 1k/share out of their shares, so when someone approaches them and says ""I'm sorry but I can't cover my shorts, the market is too irrational and I simply don't have the capital.  Can we make a deal to pay you for your shares?  If not, I go bankrupt and god knows what you'll end up getting""  they'll take it, and they'll take it for far less than the 5k, 10k, 69,420 people on here were touting.  
  
All we have to do is hold! - LOL no.  You need people to buy more to pump the price up more, because this isn't about a short squeeze anymore, it's turned into a pump & dump.  This is also why more and more posts changed from HOLD THE LINE to BUY MORE, COME ON DIAMOND HANDS.  They know they need new money to keep it going and profit more or get out of the red.  

People on here last week were claiming that the interest to borrow shares for shorting was (at one point) 50%.  Then I saw people claiming 30%.  Then the day before yesterday 18%.  Well, now wait... if the shorts haven't covered and have shorted even more for their constant 'ladder attacks'  then how is it the interest to borrow is going down?  That doesn't make sense.  If shorting is going up, less shares to borrow, less borrowing supply should drive the fees and interest to borrow them UP, not down.  
  
Insiders at GME can't sell right now, but everyone was claiming institutional shares were ""locked up"" which is not true.  Other institutional holders can sell at any point; and there's reason to believe they may have done so and capitalized on this at higher levels.  But there's another factor fighting against the little guy in the squeeze narrative.  
  
But if DFV can hold! He's risking MILLIONS for this you can hold too - This is arguably one of the worst.  It's just flat out disingenuous.  He's already taken profit.  He's already got his initial investment back.  He could ride the rest to 0 and all he's out is unrealized gains.  He still would walk away better off than the 50k he started with.  Using him as a means to guilt trip people is just disgusting.",1612599674.0,0

I am currently waiting for RH to transfer stuff (they are expecting the 10th, but who knows, i was hoping to be able to shed more funds for some shares on fidelity.)

When i noticed the weirdest thing. 

Out of no where i had a share show up for GME. And the account claimed it was negative 600 something. 

Stranger still, it was on Margin.  I thought Margin bad, so i haven't bought one on Margin. But again, i haven't bought one period on fidelity yet there it was...

Well, now, the share and the account are gone / zero. Just like when this all started.

That's you, you're an asshole.Fuck offI think I can add value to this conversation as I am what you'd call an inbetweener.

Nobody hated on me when I was new, mostly because I did not comment for nearly 6 months.  I just lurked and youtubed, for months.  Did I have questions that people here could of easily answered, sure, but this is their place of work, so respectfully I try to figure it out without disrupting their work environment.  Also, I realized that this sub was primarily about options, not buying stock.  Not to say some of us don't but stock, but I certainly don't talk about buying and holding stock here (or anywhere).  Truthfully, the buy and hold strategy is better suited to r/investing. 

Please use the following weak analogy to better relate to the OGs thoughts on some of this:

Imagine you are artist, you've educated yourself and gotten to the point where you can make a living off of your skillset.  You are part of a community of 100 of the worlds finest artists, where you all bounce ideas off of eachother.  It's a great community where members challenge one another, tune eachother in when necessary and ultimately add value to eachothers lives all while sharing amazing senses of humor.  You love it here, if you check one thing online it's this group.  It's where your battery dies.  It really means that much to you.

Then one day, 700 people join, practically overnight.  Some aren't aware of the culture, others don't care.  All they are talking about is magenta.  You hardly see familiar users, instead it's thousands of comments talking specifically of one shade, and one shade only.    Then the sub loses it's greatest moderator and with it all hope that it will ever remotely resemble what it was when you loved it.  You are sad, frustrated, and feeling a bit lost.  The very sub that gave you life and offered the most rewarding knowledge to better your self and your art is now only speaking of magenta.  You scroll daily still, until you see a comment like ""Took me a while to realise my crayon was upside down, but I drew some sweet fucking magenta today!"" (285 upvotes).  You begin to feel the way a parent who never sees other adults feels.  No stimulation and you wonder where the newbs get their energy.  What would you do?

We at WSB may get hung up on a tickers from time to time, but what's happened recently is unbearable.  We've always been rude (as far as I know), but we've also always been there for those who needed it most (when a YOLO brings us lowlow).  It really was kind of like this dressing-room kind of atmosphere before, but now it's like we are on facebook and we have too big of audience to joke the same way and are left scrolling to eternity before finding a golden nugget.  We've never been overly political, never been about 'us' vs 'them', and rarely would you even find people bickering back and forth.  Arguing isn't something gamblers partake it, make bet, and it's selttled.

I understand your frustrations as a new investor, wanting to come here and promptly get the best advice from one of our polite associates, but that's not the reason we are here.  Personally, I kind of enjoyed seeing the influx of new people come to WSB and I enjoy helping them when I can, all while staying true to the culture of course.  Anytime a group would focus on a ticker in the past, it would sort of morph into this, but never close to the scale we are seeing now.  

I wish you the best, and hope your experiences with WSB become more than you imagined.  Perhaps there is an autist in you that can enrich us also, and if not, at least make us laugh.  Until then, learn as much as you can and try to give more respect to get more respect.  I hope this helps all parties involved.

We like magenta as much as anyone else, tastes great, but to paint the daily masterpieces, we need to consider all the other tasty shades.Fuck off.great post

YOLO is not a great retirement plan.You should definitely get advice somewhere else. This sub is memes. But, my opinion is that it would depend on what you want to do. Do you want to find good, long term investments? Use an IRA or some other mutual fund. Have a stock you really like (that’s low, in a dip). Take a portion of the money you were putting in an IRA or whatever and invest. Want to learn how to day trade or play around with options? Put a very small amount of money in just to learn. Lose some, win some. Learn why you lost, learn why you won. If you feel more comfortable put a little more in, I wouldn’t do more than 20-25% of your investment money, basically ever, on options. Buy some options with plenty of time and see if it works. My number one piece of... opinion, is not to listen to anyone else to tell you what to invest in. Find something you believe to be true. Look at trends in the market and find somewhere you think is buying low that will later be higher. Never go into something because someone told you about it, especially online.Don’t come to a sub called wallstreetBETS not expecting high risk, here we lose money for breakfastYou really only need a dollar to buy an OTM fd, so id say thats the minimum.Don’t listen to any us here it’s a betting place that occasionally pays off and if you look around you’ll find a ton of bag holders that you wouldn’t want to take advice from",1612597422.0,0

- highest existing home sales since 2006

Think it'll be good for a short term play.UWMC is a good sympathy play on this also if RKT does have a great er. Sector health is good, UWMC actually had decent earnings but is trading sub $10 again. It’s not as sexy as, and doesnt have the Rkt hype machine, but IV is lower and it’s flying under the radar. I don’t have positions in either currently, but I’m tempted.",1612596788.0,27

I'm longing AMC and may continue to pump my strategy into it. I have a feeling the 12-24 months after the new normal hits, we'll see a boom in entertainment, travel and what not. 

Measly 10 shares @7.60, will probably buy a share a week at minimum if it trends where it's atAMC is still actively being shorted and there's plenty of potential for it to grow even without a short squeeze. But the squeeze is still on and if you don't sell your shares then the HF can't closeBought 244 shares at roughly $8 a share, not selling any time soon. Theaters will bounce back as things reopen.Hold and maybe buy more as prices are still fairly low. Once everything is pretty open again everywhere movie theaters will make a bit of a comebackWhat is the next step in cinema - people say at home, but that’s wrong. The theater experience will never die it’s been alive and well for thousands of years. 

The next step is likely VR/AR type experiences. 

I think AMC is dirt cheap right now, mainly because it’s going to be bought out this year. Nice to hold when/if that occurs.Buy + hold. It cant effectively get much lower than $7 naturally.Fuck your movement. We're here to make tendies.A bowel movementWhile I love the idea of bankrupting billionaires, the market isn't a place for revolution. It can't be because people are constantly trading to make profits. While 1000s of people here were saying HOLD and putting 💎🤚everywhere, 1000s of people were also trying to make a quick profit off of GME and AMC. I would bet for every 1 person trying to ""stick it to wallstreet"" there were at least 5 traders just trying to see a massive gain in their wallets. 

I would argue, most people involved in the stock market don't put much thought into the morals of their trades. Apple is one of the most popular stocks to invest in, yet it's a known fact they use sweat shops to build their devices (and most other electronics companies do too). People don't invest in Apple because they love Apple as a company, they invest in Apple because they want to make money.

As a leftist who lives in America, I find myself in a tricky position because I fundamentally don't like supporting businesses I consider to be harmful, however I cant think of many ways to avoid supporting them in the actual day to day of my life. Sure, I can avoid Apple products, and refuse to shop on Amazon but the cell phone I'm typing on was probably made by people who are underpaid. Not to mention, now that we are a year into the covid pandemic, and all 4 of my jobs have been shut down on and off, I find myself panicking about my future. 

The solution: make more money. And how do you make money in the debt machine that is America? Save and invest what little you can. My best solution to to try and invest in green energy companies because a) the democrats will be pushing for more green energy for the next 4 years so the stock prices are bound to rise and b) because I believe green energy is a good thing overall for humanity.

It's very hard for me to envision a world where ethics trumps profits in the stock market and because of that, i don't believe you can fight billionaires by buying stocks.
That being said, I'm open to being proven wrong.

I moved my account out of RH last week and my shares and options showed up after 5 days, but along came a 4000 dollar debit which I can't explain. I'm now on margin with my new broker who also doesn't know what this charge is. Come Monday I'll start paying interest on some margin I never had. My RH account had margin disabled and was just shares, a few options, and a little bit of cash. Where's the 4k from? Where's the 700 from that this poor mook in /r/robinhood is missing? Where's the 2k the other one is missing?

I saw posts on /r/robinhood and /r/robinhoodtrades that aren't going to get traction because they're tiny subs and the mods there don't want any discussion except for gains threads. Fuck em. Post on WSB. There's 8 million retards here that make up a large portion of RH's clients.

RH does not have a phone number to call. Put in an email on their support page, tell everyone here, tweet them, email them again, complain wherever you want. If we can't get answers, we're going to file with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We're going to tweet Vlad and he can reply from jail.

On Monday I was unable to sell at the very open my Microsoft but fortunately it bounce back after like a $5 drop and I did not take a loss but I reported it and they gave me $200 for my negative experience the next day I had a similar issue but the stock MR and I did not bounce back and I ended up having to close for a $550 loss. The stock was supposed to sell at 180 and 40 cents but it did not sell it it was a market order and it did not sell because a computer glitch said it did not recognize the symbol. I reported it and filed for a trade dispute. They said it would take 30 days because of the great amount of new trade disputes because of system issues. It took for 5 days and they re in burst me at the price I sold at with my market order. I highly recommend you go to Charles Schwab they have been very great they always answer their phone sometimes it's a little bit of a wait but they're always very nice and very understanding and I highly suggest you go there. Expressly for new traders because you can make lots of stupid mistakes and they a have a lot of lenient C so go there and I am so sorry to hear about your guys' of Robin hood issues I have heard nothing about horrible things ever since I started this trading's death last November like 16 months ago",1612594235.0,40

805,Stop with the ape crap.,"It’s in your best interest to stop acting like a bunch of dumb sheep who bought GME simply because they were following WSB, DFV, or the crazy FOMO price action. 

That stupid ape narrative will only be used to “protect you” with more trading restrictions for the lower classes. Think of the part time day trading rules, which make it harder to make money, but worse. 

If you’re new here, “apes together strong” was never a thing until the last couple weeks. It showed up with all the new people (bots?). Before then, we called people retards, not as a sign of strength in numbers, but to make fun of people that think they understand the market and get burned. 

I mean, yeah, it’s a joke about us being dumb. But along with loss porn, it’s a reminder to fucking be careful. Anything could happen. Use risk management.

This is a fucking casino. You could be right about some stupid stock going up 5% tomorrow. Or the whole god damned market could crash, and you’ll just be another loser down 20%, regardless of your amazing DD. 

We all know the risks. 

So don’t whine about losing all your money. Don’t ask for handouts on this sub, because you risked more than you could lose. More than anything, stop acting like ignorance makes you strong. It never did. 

It’s your money. You made grown up decisions. Own your losses. Don’t let legislation take more freedoms away from us within the “free market” to protect us, the ‘poor dumb apes.’

WSB is being scapegoated for this fiasco, even though many of us had good reasons to invest in GME. The thing that wasn’t accounted for by most people was the sudden restriction on buying for multiple days until all momentum died. The ability for brokers to abruptly make that decision needs to be challenged.

So pull yourself together and do some research about the way brokers created an artificial selling pressure to push the price down. Then, maybe contact your state representatives with something more coherent than diamond hands and ape noises.

Edit: typos because it’s 1am, I’m tired and retarded.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldrwvl/stop_with_the_ape_crap/,"Mostly call themselves retard because its an anagram of trader... Thats the joke..Sir, the market can’t crash tomorrow. Its Saturday.  😂✌🏼💰 we are all “holding the line” 

Snark aside, good write up. I miss the old sub.The Ape bullshit started when this page hit 3M+So, I *am* an actual Hominoidea (ape) biologist. Specifically, I study mentally handicapped apes. In our circles, we lovingly refer to them as **handicapes**.

If you don't mind, I'd like to highlight a few of our studies. The following is proven by peer-reviewed research, though, the field is quite niche I'll admit, as there's only two of us in the world. We actually review each other's work for publications. 

- extremely mentally challenged apes (retarded) are very poor at risk management compared to other Hominoidea. They will often stop mid-banana while eating, only to get jealous of one of their mate's (other retarded apes) banana pile in a different cage, if the handlers are actively adding to that stockpile while smiling, laughing, and commenting loudly about it. They will comminly work into such a frenzy that they throw their own bananas out of their cage, resulting in having no bananas at all . We refer to this as ""banana insana""

- when the handlers change out from their main handler (whom they have known for years) to a new handler that knows nothing about them, they are often too challenged to understand the difference. The result is them continuing throughout their days as if nothing changed. Other Hominoidea would not cope well in this situation, and would likely revolt

- handicapes are indeed stronger than normal apes, at an average of 23% increase in brute strength. 

- handicapes are almost completely unable to detect real apes vs robotic apes. They will often try to interact or will react to ape-'bots' as if they were real beings. It's quite bizzare actually. As normal apes would quickly recognize that the robotic ape was not real, and will often destroy them; handicapes will commonly even try to mate with the bots.

- autistic apes (autist) are significantly better at managing their resources than retarded apes. Autistic apes in fact, even compared to normal Hominoidea, are the first to find new food stockpiles, will spend any and all energy to achieve hoarding that food, typically with great at success.

- handicapes, when restricted to only one banana a day from their standard feeding bin (even when a bin right next to it has many bananas), will often not recognize that they could easily switch feeding bins for more bananas. The feeding bins are literally 2-3 feet away, but they will not switch even when their standard bin has essentially betrayed them.

- handicapes will often assert themselves in a new environment, completely dominating interaction among apes that had previously been in that environment for years

- one side note - handicapes require significantly more supervision and rules. Otherwise, they are just too reckless and essentially fuck everything up. They don't realize that acting the way they do, forces us to implement new restrictions that give them less options so that they will never be able to play games with normal, mature Hominoidea (we refer to these as ""the big boys"").

Edit: I forgot one - mentally handicapped apes often require symbols or signs for communication. GME 🚀🚀🚀

Get at me",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldrvnx/so_what_about_the_gamestop_business_model_makes/,"Gotta do some research brozinski.Do some research.I'm selling them my broken PS3 and they'll refurb and sell it for a profit. that's how.

ps- get lostWell you have to look at their shift and focus now. Blockbuster and Gamestop are not in the same market. Blockbuster died because everything went digital.

Video games aren't all digital yet and each new game takes up like 1/4 your hard drive. So either until internet becomes fast enough to stream 100gbs worth of data rather quickly I really can't see an all digital gaming library for awhile. 

Another thing to add is that game stop doesn't just deal with games either. They deal with the hardware aspect as well. So that's something that has longevity. Most people thst want used items or refurbished won't buy from eBay for one reason or another. 

Finally they deal with hobby items. They own think geek and a bunch of other things. 

All in all they have everything going for them to turn it around. Good leaders, good road map and a good distribution system. It all comes down to execution on their part.

Do I believe in Gamestop? Yes. But not at the prices its at currently.

I find it useful for any that are giving into negativity by the hands that give hand-jobs with the quality grip of paper, to realise GME is not just a mere speculative bubble anymore but a plausible and prosperous business model with longevity in mind. Here is an extract from a research paper of what to think about while you hold with those diamond hands of yours. If you must get further approval from your wife’s boyfriend then do so but make your own choices.

“Although the years-long short thesis implies a terminal value of zero (bankruptcy), we see this outcome as virtually impossible given the current state of GameStop’s financials, incoming console revenue, and proven ecommerce results trajectory. In fact, our analysis clearly shows
3 distinct paths to profitability:

• A Bear Case ($32.00) tracking the existing “GameStop Reboot” initiative, with successful footprint rationalization to 2,000 stores in North America by 2023, steady ecommerce contribution, and a continued market decline in physical games not offset by major business model updates.

• A Base Case ($80.00) that is similar, but with a material increase in ecommerce revenue contribution, plus greater impact from digital revenue sharing with vendors, and some participation in other digital-first businesses.

• A Bull Case ($169.00) based on a full transition by 2025 to the ecommerce- first “cultural gaming hub” hinted at by Ryan Cohen, with a significant increase in revenue attributed to ecommerce, new vendor partnerships, meaningful participation in the advertising revenue pool for gaming, and growth acceleration in the overall TAM for gaming.”

825,Can we short DISNEY for firing Johnny Depp?,"Last year, Johnny Depp lost his libel case in the UK High Court against The Sun newspaper, who referred to him as a ""wife beater"" - an accusation he strongly denies. His wife Amber Heard, who the star married six years ago, alleged 14 incidents of assault by her ex-husband in the case. While now Depp and his legal team are set to receive an oral hearing in March as they seek to appeal the court's decision.

After losing the case, Warner Bros asked Depp to resign his role of the villain Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts series of films, which he accepted.

The star had only shot one scene for the third movie, with Mads Mikkelsen replacing him in the Harry Potter prequels.

Meanwhile, supporters of Depp have been wondering if he'll be able to reprise his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean 6 and beyond.

Well according to The Hollywood Reporter, producer Jerry Bruckheimer wanted the 57-year-old to at least cameo in the upcoming Margot Robbie-led spin-off, but allegedly Disney balked at the idea.

Nevertheless, Depp's fans have been right behind him in calls for the star to be reinstated as Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.

And now a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/walt-disney-we-want-johnny-depp-back-as-captain-jack-sparrow?recruiter=1130028160&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_abi&recruited_by_id=f8962fc0-c2db-11ea-9dae-ff90a47377cc) titled ""We want JOHNNY DEPP back as CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW"" is fast approaching half a million signatures.""

829,Can we really trust the February 9th release of info on shorts?,"I have a very bad feeling that hedges are waiting for this date to show some kind of mis-represented or misleading information on the shorts, and causing the stock to crash further before selling.

Everyone here is saying s3 changed their formula, as well as other sites. There's a general consent that [its very possible] hedge funds using dirty tactics to also make it look like they've covered when they couldn't possibly. As there simply wasn't enough volume and upward stock movement to cover. 

If they can't manipulate or misrepresent the nasdaq results, then they should be very aware of the high possibility the stock will rebound on Feb 9-10. So unless they cover their positions on Monday (which is VERY last minute) they're going to be paying way way more to cover than it is now. On top of that, I'm expecting the volume / price on Monday to go up, as many people are similarly speculating  possibility of GME making a comeback with the Short news.

However, if they can manipulate or misrepresent the NASDAQ listings, it would make a lot more sense: as a lot of people are holding onto the stock for the Feb 9 results. If that happens, I imagine they would cover on the 11-12 after the price drops 

What are your thoughts on the matter?

**Edit: to clarify I'm very bullish on GME. I'm not trying to spread FUD. I'm trying to explain why it might be a good idea to hold past Feb 9th if the stock crashed. As well as why the short interest might look the way it is**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldrh2r/can_we_really_trust_the_february_9th_release_of/,I’d be more interested to understand why is the expectation for feb 9 data to be different than s3/ortex.

830,EFTs and basic industry standards for morons,"Hey scrubs, financial advisor here. I will not disclose the firm I work at, but regularly do business with just about all of the big ones, including Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, JPMorgan, and more. None of what follows is advice, but education for the unwashed masses who keep asking the same questions over and over that I'm tired of seeing, all over WSB and the other investing subreddits. Here are some basics on settlements, linking bank accounts, EFTs, wires, and transfers to/from institutions.

**EFTs and linking bank accounts**

1. When attempting to link a bank account to a new account at your broker of choice, the firm will attempt to establish contact with your bank and confirm that the account exists and that it belongs to you. If the bank has the infrastructure in place to verify this digitally, your link will be instant. As a result, big banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo should instantly link and allow you to transfer funds.
2. If the link is not instant, your bank was unable to verify immediately. This is common for credit unions, small banks, and is about 50/50 for the online banks. They simply do not have the infrastructure in place to instantly verify. A good broker will now require you to upload proof that the account is yours - generally a voided check or bank statement. This is a security measure to protect you idiots, and you should be grateful for it. IMPORTANT: If needing to submit documents as proof, this will normally take up to 3 business days to approve. However, as it is the busy season for brokers (see the bottom note on this post), it's likely that their back offices are overwhelmed and it may take longer. Pick a different bank if you have a problem with this.
3. EFTs typically process within 3 business days, or 72 hours. If this is a NEW relationship with a broker and you make a larger transfer, the very first transfer may take longer, generally up to 10 business days. Once again, this is a security measure to protect against fraud. Subsequent transfers will now adhere to the 3 business day rule in most cases, barring extenuating circumstances.
4. If you're desperate, you should be able to locate wire information for your broker. You can now wire funds directly to your brokerage account for instant settlement.

**Wires for dummies**

Bank wires generally settle instantly or very quickly (within minutes) IF YOU MEET THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:

Process the fucking wire before 4pm EST, because that's when the central banks start to close. If you process close to 4pm or after, it will settle on a best efforts basis, which usually means the next morning. Don't be an idiot.

Also keep in mind that many firms charge a fee to send a wire, but some do not. I know of a few that do not charge to send or receive wires, but I'm not here to advise or tell you idiots where to go with your money.

**Transfer of assets (TOA) via the ACATS system**

1. ACATS is the system by which most brokerage firms can transfer shares back and forth without selling. Doing so requires you to have an account of the same registration at the receiving firm to the one at the contrafirm that will be sending the shares. Roth IRA to Roth IRA, taxable brokerage to taxable brokerage.
2. Most assets, particularly ETFs, individual equities, and bonds will transfer in-kind. Most mutual funds as well. Be sure to verify that you do not hold any institutional mutual funds before transferring, as they may be required to be sold. This isn't a big deal in a tax-deferred account, but can screw you over in a taxable one. Penny stocks are accepted on a firm-by-firm basis, so be sure to check your firms rules. Again, this is to protect your stupid asses.
3. Initiating a TOA is done on the receiving firms end and generally requires you to upload a statement from the contrafirm dated within the last six months which shows your account registration, number, your name, and the positions within the account. Settlement is generally 7-10 business days, but often process as quickly as 3-5, if you're transferring between large firms.
4. If your cost basis and metadata doesn't show right away, sit the fuck down and chill out. It will follow within a few business days most of the time, but can take up to a full month, depending on firm. E-Trade is notorious for being slow about their metadata. 
5. A full account TOA will result in the receiving firm ""sweeping"" the old account for a month. Residual balances, cash, dividends, and more will sweep over. If you still have a balance after a month, simply initiate a new TOA.
6. Most firms will not require paperwork for an ACATS transfer, but if you must fill some out, it's because the contrafirm wants a signature for whatever reason. Stupid, but sometimes necessary to move on with your life. If you're charged a transfer fee by the contrafirm and are actually transferring real money and not the lunch money your mom gave you, call the new broker and request that it be reimbursed. If your new broker has local branches, start there - you'll have less of a wait time and will likely get to speak with a senior planner, but they're generally only open during normal business hours.

**DTC transfers**

DTC transfers are not as common as TOAs via the ACATS system, but are sometimes necessary. If needed, check with your receiving firm to acquire their DTC number, then call your current firm to request the DTC transfer. You'll need your new firm's information, your new account number, and the new firms DTC number handy.

**Basic customer support availability**

1. The busiest times for brokerage firms are at the end of the tax year and the beginning of the new year through tax time. The reason for this is that many clients who have actual money - which excludes most of you - have tax-related items to address and typically put it off until the last second. For end of year, this includes last-minute tax-loss harvesting, charitable giving strategies, required minimum distributions, retirement account contributions, and more. For the new year, it can be some of the same but, more often than not, is all of the planning, money movement, and close-of-business that clients put off during the holidays and now want to address in the new year.

2. This means that your hold times are likely to be long, so be nice to your goddamn reps and try calling before market open, before lunch, or early afternoon. Around the open, lunch time, and just after normal business hours are typically the worst times to try and get through. If you have an advisor in a 1:1 capacity, they may or may not be able to help you ""skip the queue"", but may or may not be available themselves. Also note that while many of these firms offer 24/7 support and service, many teams are only available during certain business hours. Generally advisors/planners, specialist teams, etc. Ex - you wanna talk to your firm's strategy desk after market close? Tough shit, they're probably gone.

1. When you win, please be great full. I know I’m no og but for those of us that have been here prior to the GME craze understand when to be happy about a win. If you make money you should be happy. No it’s ands or buts, you have a dollar that you didn’t have before be grateful for god sake.
2. To the losers (not in a negative tone). If you thought the market was going to be easy and just print money for you I am truly sorry to burst your bubble. If things where that easy then everyone would be rich. You may think that you are special so you can win in this game. Well hate to break it to you, you may be special but not special enough to win in this game.
3. UNDERSTANDING: be aware that the market has ups and downs. Panic is not the answer. Some days your up some days your down. If you want to succeed in the game you need to be persistent but not naive. Understand when a loss is a loss but don’t get to trigger happy.
4. Everyone has won and everyone has lost don’t think your special because you just so happened to be on either side. 
5. LASTY: if you have taken a large loss, remain calm. Everything will be ok! I’m not telling you to double down but I’m not saying to quit. You need to evaluate your financial position and make an educated decision on whether or not to continue. If you have lost greatly, sometimes it’s best to take a break and revaluate at a later time. DONT WORRY YOU WILL BE OK!

839,Most recent $GME Short Interest data according to S3 Partners puts shorts at an average short of just $53 a share as of 2/5,"Please bear with me, as this is my first post here after reading a thousand posts over the past month or so.  HODLing 120 shares of $GME, I am not a financial professional, definitely don't buy on my advice alone, do your own DD.  

As we all know, finding accurate short interest data is hard to come by.  By the time the official numbers are released (coming this Tuesday 2/9!) it is too late, as they are for almost 2 weeks prior.  As such, we have to rely on estimates of the data.  One of the companies providing those estimates is S3 Partners.  Many of us here have very mixed opinions about them, and my own is still being decided.  

Regardless, if the information they are providing is any way accurate, it gives us a sense of what price the shorts are in at, which is a huge factor at play.  If they had covered earlier, and then shorted the stock at 350 a share?  Bad news for us.  However, it appears this is not the case!  Read on, those of you that can.  Have a banana for those of you who cannot.

2 days ago, the twitter face of S3's data, Ihor Dusaniwsky tweeted this:

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1357352226507915265](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1357352226507915265)

"" [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) short interest is $2.39BN; 25.86M shs shorted; 50.68% SI % Float; 33.63% S3 SI % Float; 11% borrow fee and rising. Shs shorted have decreased by -36.2M over the last week. Shorts are down -$8.68BN in 2021, which includes up +$437M on today's -18% move.""

Now I'm no expert, but a dollar amount on the short interest, coupled with the number of shares, should give us an estimate of the average dollar amount that shares are being shorted at, right?  If I short 100 shares at $10 apiece, my short interest is $1000, no?  Well, take that $2.39BN and 25.86M shares shorted the other day, and you get $92.42.  Which makes sense, because he goes on to say that they are up $437M on Thursday, as the stock was down 18% at the time and the numbers work out.  

Likewise, he tweets again the day tomorrow, 2/5, with similar data, BUT one big difference.  The number of shares shorted is barely changed, however the short interest is only $1.38BN now.  Read:

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1357720599699849217](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1357720599699849217)

"" [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) short interest is $1.36BN; 25.40M shs shorted; 49.77% SI % Float; 33.23% S3 SI % Float; 8.83% borrow fee. Shs shorted have decreased by -32.4M over the last week. Shorts are down -$8.48BN in 2021, which includes down -$368M on today's +27% move to $68.""

And much like the day before, the numbers add up!  They lost $368M because the stock rose from $54 to what he was seeing at the time, $68ish, and 25.4M shares shorted times $14 apiece is a loss of $368M.  Furthermore, it lines up with the price they are now shorted at, which was $53.54 a share ($1.36B/25.4M shares).  

&#x200B;

Okay, if you're still with me, and I'm totally off base here, let me know.  I'm actually not a true believer in a short squeeze still happening. However I am a true believer in not allowing hedge funds to short a company to oblivion.  They are neither fraudulent nor in financial difficulties, they have new leadership and a path forward, and while one could argue what the true price of their stock should be, you could say that about half of the speculative stocks that exist in the market today.

American Battery Metals Corp (OTCQB: ABML) CEO Doug Cole joined Steve Darling from Proactive with news the company has been awarded a $4.5 million grant by the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office. The grant is part of the DOE’s effort to reduce the US’s dependence on critical materials by aiding American companies.

Cole says what's more, the commercial pilot pilot will produce 20,000 tons of recycled battery metals, translating to $200M in revenues. Cole adds the group will work towards producing 200,000 tons. The company completed three key milestones regarding its pilot recycling plant located in Fernley, Nevada. The company announced that it purchased the land at 345, Winston Lane in Fernley where ABMC will build five buildings as part of the campus.

Additionally, the company also managed to clinch the crucial water rights for the plant.

It is a major development for ABMC since the company will be able to operate its pilot plant at full tilt for many years without any scarcity of water.

Last but not the least; the company also revealed that it appointed the services Miles Construction to be the designer and contractor for the pilot plant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldqycw/ticker_abml_is_a_no_brainer_if_you_can_buy/,"Sir this is a telephone poleI like this one.Sure but you’re about 6 months late to that party.

844,GME and future of WSB ?,"Fellow retards,

I have a couple points I'd like to discuss. I owned GME and sold it most of them when Robinhood screwed us for good. I made TENDIES which is what mattered and why I have been in the sub. I'm not a paid hedge fund bot or shill but I AGREE that hedge funds would love the current state of this sub in my smooth opinion.

I've been following the sub around a year. I was a retard and brained washed by boomer financial advices which didn't make me a lot of TENDIES. I got hooked in during March/April when the stock market crashed and autists made fortunes with puts on SPY and calls on Tesla. I was amazed by beautiful retardness.

WSB did something truly amazing. GME was the trade of this quarter century. A dude in basement with DDs and bunch of retards did something crazy. Thousands of retards made thousands of dollars. It has changed lifes for good for many people.

However, the sub has been fallen victim to its success. Let me be clear, the GME was to make Tendies. Taking out a hedge fund was a bonus not the purpose because we know the game is rigged. It's what it is. Unless you have a trillion dollar, you are not likely to change wall street for retail traders and retards. When GME took off and went viral, truly mentally challenged people of reddit homepage jumped on it and it has been transformed into a ""movement"". TVs, newspapers show this as little guys take on wall street and Elon Musk and Mark Cuban supported this(positions or ban?talk is cheap) I read bunch of comments and got heartbroken that people got in to make money and destroy hedge funds. Now, GME is the only thing. We have lost Tesla gang,Palantir gang,Palenton gang,theta gang who had provided real DD and were the people who came up with GME along with many other trades. Those people made WSB a place where retards gamble but with some sort of fundamental that can increase you change from 0 to 4.2069% Now we cannot hear them due to noise.

Now, the sub is filled with people who just yell ""HOLD!!!!!"" ""BUY MORE"" ""WHO HOLDS????"" ""GME WILL GO TO MOON"". I hope it does and people who got fucked recover. BUT THIS REDUCES THE SUB INTO A SINGLE TRADE where previously there were chances you can actually hear new retarded things that could make you money. Guess who benefits from this current state? GME Diamond Hands with $1000? or Wall St. who is playing carrot on a stick.

A hedge fund made $700M on GME. Citadel who has shady relationships with Robinhood made tons of money as market maker because of insane increase of volume. A lot of hedge funds shorted at $300s and made millions. And we are bombarded with truly stupid posts of ""WHO HOLDS GME????$5000 IS NOT A MEME"" I'd love hearing DDs like DFVs and explain the game plan but these people are actually retards. They just yell some slogans and getting emotional. Sharing the old finra report won't help US.

I wholeheartedly hope that GME holders are right, it goes to $5000 and makes millions. I'd be happy for them but if we narrow to one trade (or BANG), we actually give up millions of TENDIES on other trades. We don't get new info. We don't get new DDs. Please stop spamming and provide actual DD so it can actually bring people back on GME if you are right. This would help you too.

We need to find our next GMEs. That's how you make TENDIES. We need retards who got stuff right like messiah DFV so we can win. Everytime we make a good trade, you actually fight off the rigged system.

tl;dr: GME narrows down us to a single trade. We need to restore our DNA and get DDs,reduce noise and hear new things that can make us TENDIES. Otherwise GME can be cancerous to this sub which holds you back to make TENDIES

854,"So just to divert attention away from the complete tom-fuckery of the last few weeks, how's Tesla going?","No DD here, just a thought. 

Tesla shares have been pretty volatile, and for the last 3 weeks its been jumping between 800 and 900, but is yet to see any serious gainz. My theory is that with how the last few weeks have gone, tesla hasn't really felt the love of this subreddit, and it showing it. So I would expect that as the current hype of the stock that shall not be named dies down, tesla will be getting its much needed attention back, and with it bouncing off the 900 mark a few times, the retards of WSB will be more than enough to break the 900.

860,What if we are underestimating the size of the GME powder keg?,"Purely speculation but given how absolutely excessive the hedge funds, DTCC, and brokers have tried to keep GME from squeezing, I'm wondering if we've completely underestimated the damage a real GME squeeze might do?

Do we actually know what the real OTC short interest is at and can we trust the reported number? What if it's 10x or 100x higher, we'd have no idea. If the short squeeze actually happened, which is a theoretical infinite squeeze, drive the GME price so some ridiculous million dollar mark, even if briefly?

Melvin will go bankrupt, sure, but they're a pretty small fish, it seems excessive to do all this manipulation to save a fledging hedge fund unless the brokers, DTCC, maybe even the entire market is under threat, causing the coordinates attacks we're seeing in an effort to diffuse this.

We also haven't heard a peep from anything from inside these organizations or hedges, it feels like a strict gag order is in effect and the one insider post (if you believe it) seems to paint a picture of an absolute panic inside the financial system, which again seems excessive if only a few smaller hedges like Melvin are being taken down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldq3dw/what_if_we_are_underestimating_the_size_of_the/,"Sir, this is FebruaryYeah Gamestop is gonna be worth $1M a share broThe only thing I'm underestimating is the extent of retardedness in this fucking zoo right nowPut on your tinfoil Hat dude otherwise wall street can hear you!!!!What if your no longer retarded but now schizophrenicLotta hating out there wow hahahahaGo to r/GME they can answer your questionsI think I remember seeing some more info about this on /r/GME actually you might want to check there!/r/gme definitely has the answers youre looking for broWho would have been on the hook if the dtcc couldn’t cover?

862,Discussion: Hot take my losses straight into $JETS,"Since technically I don’t have $2500 into this, I cannot “YOLO” but I feel like $1000 is yolo-ed enough for my small wallet. 

Coming back from RONA, I believe that airline companies have the unprecedented opportunity to recover drastically from the pandemic and make a MOONFULL of profits after successful rollout of the vaccine. 

Points:

- United Airlines is already delivering large quantities of vaccine from overseas, and partners with Clorox to keep their planes squeaky (1)

- AA has expanded domestic and international testing for its passengers to make travel seamless to highly popular leisure destinations, and announcing more promising data from 2020 seeing less losses than expected (2)


- Delta Airlines has stated that they will keep middle seats blocked until the end of March, and they have kept their daily cash flown burn to about $10mil a day (just think what their profits will do when they open up that middle seat) (3/4) 

- Southwest Airlines unfortunately has posted its first loss in the company’s HISTORY, but stands to profit off of losses as leisure travel still dominates (which is their whole operation). Also, they continue to shift focus on opening new destinations across the United States DURING RONA (5)

- Frontier and Spirit Airlines are making enough profit to continue their pilot hiring, which in turn, leads to more flights being flown (6)

All said and done, people WILL want to keep traveling after this is said and done. Airlines stand to make MAD MONEY profit as flight loads from not only shipping the vaccine, but filling up with leisure travelers starts happening *best case scenario* late Q2 or mid Q3 (you can already see this as big airlines are flying fuller large wide body jets to places like Florida and Mexico). 

Loss to riches all in to JETS baby, let’s make that comeback COME BACk! I’ll be going in every paycheck until I can post that YOLO flair.

tldr; Travel come back, Airlines make money, yay

edit: didn't even read too excited.Counterpoint, business flight may be waaay down for long since company are getting used/equipped for remote meeting.I missed these posts thank youThat’s pretty good, here’s some insight from an Aircraft Mechanic working at one of these big airlines. A lot of the airplanes are currently in storage but recently there have been a lot of re-activations, especially this month and scheduled ones through April. 2021 unfortunately is still in the process of recovering from Covid and it’ll take perhaps all of 2022 for people to start flying at a regular pace again. With that said 2023 is an expected year for the company I work for to return to its former glory or beyond that.  FAA has re-certified the 737 MAX, airlines are taking covid precautions and maintaining its cabins sanitized for passenger use so its all a big set up for good thing to come. To add to that my company upon hitting a huge slump due to Covid started buying the shit out of it’s own stock, if that doesn’t raise an eyebrow then idk. Worth it buying now and sitting on it, it’ll pay off. Good luckYou might want to look into $AER as well. They lease out aircraft so they will also benefit from increased airline activityAnecodtal counterpoint - I have two friends in the airline industry who both told me that the word going around corporate is that the industry will take a minimum 10 years to recover from all this. My one friend, a passenger jet pilot was laid off indefinitely, and my other friend who works in de-icing saw 400 of his colleagues let go this year. Thats 1/4 of the workforce at his airport.

[https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)I tried to find it but there’s a lot of info to sift though.I mean the short % is probably huge because it was artificially inflated at 400 and tons of people would want to short at that, and it's not like that's going to get a squeeze, they can sell whenever for a profit.You can check the timeline or my recent comments that explains this. Considering this question is asked twice an hour I don't want to keep having to answer it.",1612584837.0,0
874,What do y'all think the GME stock will end up looking like after the dust settles?,"Do you guys think that the stock will rise before falling again? Or rise and stay at a high price? Or crash?? 

I really want to see people's predictions :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldpm9p/what_do_yall_think_the_gme_stock_will_end_up/,"Bounce up to 150$... then drop to 30$I honestly have no idea myself so I want to see the opinions and predictions of others :)

Thanks so much!!Totally depends on their end. Frankly they have strong leadership and just made some good hires recently. If they restructure properly, I expect them to bounce back after a hard dip and then make a 10-20% gain during restructuringNo idea, but I am buying back in for the long haul at 30 and 20 again respectively. I still believe in Cohen, but I need a fucking cooling off period and a lower buy in.Thinking outside the squeeze, if it happens in the future or already happened, I think the stock will go down and settle between $10-$20. From there it depends on what the company does. If they do a good pivot that works out I think it will have a steady climb. Otherwise it just crashes and burns and goes out of business.Yall all got left holding the bag. Make better choices in the future and don't invest on 1 old news and 2 emotion.$10Dead cat to 90 tops then down to $10 over the next 6 weeks.I think it’s gonna crash fast. Yeah people boosted it but it’s still a failing company so it’s share will probably drop back to where it was if not lower in not too long$0. When they start discounting the digital version of games like they do disc versions then there will be no use for them.",1612584827.0,5
875,Numbers don't lie. If you look at who made money then you need to consider that this whole GME thing was probably engineered by hedge funds (Citadel & SAC) to suck in retail. Retail short squeezing a hedge fund was the only narrative that could have allowed them to sell GME for $300.,"Citadel has access to Robinhood's order flow, their whole business model is to front run you, so what are the chances that a short squeeze flies under their radar? After the ""squeeze"" Melvin received fresh capital, they never got squeezed. WSB lost money. This was probably a set up by SAC & Citadel to squeeze retail with GME. While everyone here was going all in hoping to stick it to Wall street someone else was unloading worthless GME shares for $300. Then they continued from $300 down to $50 while WSB was being advised to hold with diamond hands or to buy more, adding even more liquidity for whoever was exiting.

In the end you guys became famous and lost money, while hedge funds made money but were *humiliated*.

Edit: Till this morning accounts with less than 1500 couldn't comment, now they can suddenly comment again since I posted this and another post about extreme silver positioning. **This subreddit is captured by hedge funds, the SEC needs to investigate admins and all reddit logs about the activity here. These guys engineered a PnD (gme) and hid it in plain sight by making it look like retail short squeezed a hedge fund.** SEC are you watching???!

Hold the line amirite? THEYRE BLEEDING AND SCAREDThis is how they paid for the space lasers.You are actually retardedNaw it wasn’t some conspiracy theory. Massive news cycle triggered buy signals for players across the spectrum which lead to massive capital being injected (non-retail)The likely culprits were rival hedge funds that saw their competitors in a compromised position and pumped enough in at the $50-60 mark to trip the buy signals on the algos which lead to the crazy swings and circuit breakers.

Algos tend to be the reason for the flash crashes/swings we see that’s why the circuit breaker is criticalDoesn’t sound that crazy at all. Trying to stay neutral but...I mean they are the casino soooo...win?Hey yall if a bio company has two different companies like a manufacturer. Do you have to buy both stocks from both companies? Or do they profit from the same upstick?That happens when people ignore the most important rule in investing: ""never buy overpriced garbage""",1612584553.0,6
