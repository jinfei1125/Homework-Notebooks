His company RKT mortgage literally smashes every ER by a country mile and hes tired of his stock being held down by these spineless cowards. [Farner is actively going to war with them Elon style.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-ceo-not-stock-174605720.html)

Let me outline how this mega-autist CEO is going to force the **shorts to squeeze themselves by 3/9.**

Farner, along with company founder Dan Gilbert, and the leadership team own 95% of Rocket Companies.

* Theres currently 113m shares outstanding
* 38% of those shares are short
* CEO/Founder own 95% of the 2B float ( note this for later )

So a quick math lesson tells us:

38% of 115m = \~ 43 mm shares short

**NOW THE FUN PART**

In their most recent investor meeting team $RKT rolled up to the shorts door like the dancing pallbearers and introduced a $1.11/share SPECIAL DIVIDEND to be paid to anyone holding RKT stock by 3/9.

So.. what does this mean for shorts? Weve arrived at the BDE moment..

**SHORTS HAVE TO PAY THE DIVIDEND**

Shorts have to pay $1.11 for every share they are short on 3/9

BUYBACK PROGRAM

What else was in that juicy investor conference? Wait for it‚Ä¶

**$1 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK PROGRAM**

See, RKT makes so much fucking money they can afford not only a special divi, but a $1B share buyback. Im telling you this man is going into the trenches and clearing the shorts out by his fucking self.

**TLDR:**

$RKT has been suppressed for way too fuckin long, the company owns 95% of the shares and Jay Farner/Dan Gilbert hate shorts and they have diamond fuckin nuts, they aint sellin. Shorts have to cover their 43mm shares or they are **forced to pay $1.11/share they are short on 3/9**.

Also, if you can‚Äôt do math. If u buy shares and hold thru 3/9.. it‚Äôs an instant 5% return via the special dividend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb407/rkt_ceo_forcing_shorts_to_pay_for_their_own/,1614610357.0,4895,4895,0

19,The most valuable stock you‚Äôll ever own is your own brain. Don‚Äôt ruin it with a gambling addiction.,"I see the situation as being this: 

Hedge funds band together and manipulate the market, in a ‚Äúlegal‚Äù way, they‚Äôve been doing it since 1999,

Now with social media, a bunch of redditors can get together and and form their own democratized hedge fund, to get in on the action basically

And we are winning.

HOWEVER,

I see a problem in that unlike the hedge fund managers, we are personally invested in our portfolios.  This is not just a number on a spreadsheet to many of us, it‚Äôs a house, it‚Äôs a car payment, it‚Äôs insurance...  We have a lot riding on this.

I am very fortunate that I am only investing in this as a game and I don‚Äôt need to win money to pay off debts or feed myself, but I still found that when my $220 turned into $4k, it was a very very visceral experience.  It was well all I could think about that entire day and night, even into the next morning.  

Maybe you see where this is going.  I believe the truth is that we are doing a good thing, we are swindling the swindlers, and it feels damn good, BUT, and I don‚Äôt mean to poop on everyone‚Äôs party, I can only see this as having a bad ending, where people put lots and lots of money in and they eventually change the rules so that we can‚Äôt win anymore and we‚Äôd have to move onto the next thing, and the hedge funds will be fine and go back to scamming America while a lot of us who can‚Äôt afford to lose much lose all their money and now have an expectation that the stock market will spit out crazy returns, which it won‚Äôt.

The big institutions have always made the majority of their money by preying on everyday Americans instincts to buy and sell, they make money off of the activity, it doesn‚Äôt matter if it goes up or down really, they just try to sucker as many people as possible into putting as much money into stocks so they can make money off commissions, fees etc.

Heed this warning please, don‚Äôt get caught up in the dopamine loop, don‚Äôt get left with an addiction in the stock market.  In the long term your mental health is much more important than any returns, the money is just the points in the game, your brain is your seat of consciousness through which you interpret everything, it‚Äôs a shitty shitty trade to trade one ounce of mental well-being for any amount of money really.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb20g/the_most_valuable_stock_youll_ever_own_is_your/,1614610208.0,4302,4302,0

27,"Rant for more fact based, calm and thoughtful behavior regarding GME","First of all, sorry for my German potato English. I am relatively new to this retarded sub, started lurking in it around December 2020 I think, because that was when I started ""investing"". 

That's also why I don't want to talk about the trading/financial aspects of this whole meme stock situation, but want to take a look at the general behavior and use of language the past two months.

After deeply following the discussions about the effects of fake news, filter bubbles, the radicalization of individuals through social media and the laws and regulations regarding these topics in the past years (including research on these topics for an essay I wrote as a law student, which I still am), there are certain key words or phrases that have been established in the discussions and DDs regarding GME etc. that either make me really angry, frustrated or irritated. In the past couple of weeks, I had these thoughts swirling around, and wanted to share them:

\- I know confirmation bias is strong in all of us, me included, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't allow and discredit different opinions. A civilized discussion, where every argument/fact backed standpoint is heared and respected, is what brings the best results and answers, regardless the topic. 

\- ""CNBC FAKE NEWS"", ""THE MEDIA IS BOUGHT BY HFs"" etc. I totally see where these claims are coming from (the strange amount of articles regarding SLV etc.), but endlessly repeating these phrases has not a single positive effect. In my opinion, these phrases aren't apolitical at all, and hence shouldn't even be allowed in this sub. I'll explain why: Not only in the US, but also in Germany, these phrases, portraying established media outlets as ""fake"", ""controlled by XY"", ""biased towards left/right"", are predominantly used by populist groups and people with tendencies towards the conspiracy scene. Based on this, I can't read these phrases in a non political way, especially with all the discussions of the past years in mind. That's why I find it irritating to read these phrases over and over again not only in the daily discussion and GME threads, but also in popular posts on the hot page of wsb. 

\- In addition to the previous point, I'd like to introduce you to the concept of ambiguity (in-)tolerance.  

""Intolerance of ambiguity may be defined as ‚Äòthe tendency to perceive (i.e. interpret) ambiguous situations as sources of threat‚Äô; tolerance of ambiguity as ‚Äòthe tendency to perceive ambiguous situations as desirable"" [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity_tolerance‚Äìintolerance)

 A phenomenon of social media ""discussions"" nowadays is the find, that many people are lacking the ability to accept different opinions and to accept the fact, that an event or a fact, (e.g. GME stock price, short %) may have more than one possible reason or explanation, especially if you prefer on of the reasons over the others. 

Regarding our situation, this often leads to people down voting, hating on and even threatening users who try to show different possible perspectives on the events surrounding the GME craze instead of having an open discussion and being thankful for a broader look on the situation. 

\- ""short ladder attacks"" This term, which was used more and more often during the first weeks of February after GME hit its high, resurfaced in the past couple of days in many threads and posts, even though we had many very solid DDs on why this term and concept is wrong and shouldn't be used. I don't know why, but I can't read any post with that term in it without a strange feeling in my guts, regardless of the overall quality of the post. 

Some additional points:

\- Since GME settled at around 40$, we had a new trending post setting a fixed event or date as the ""MOON TIME"" almost every day. and correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I remember not a single one of these theories became true. Most of the time it even felt like it had the opposite effect of letting the stock price drop once reaching the predicted date. That's why I stopped trusting these kinds of posts and hyping myself up for then being let down once again. The next ""big date"" is the 19th of March, with many people hoping for that to be the rocket launch. And as much as I too wish for it to be true, I really don't think we should continue to name fixed dates for a liftoff. 

Regarding that you always have to remember, that everything written here can be and most probably is read by not only us little idiot sandwiches, but by every single HF social media guy, every journalist and every other person who feels the need to waste some time on here. 

My conclusion is, that every hype that arises, also attracts people who bet on the bursting of it.

\- That leads to another point I want to make: not every chart action that happens is an evil strategy of a Bond villain like HF Manager. As I understand, it is a long known and ""popular"" strategy to invert the trending stock actions (buys/sells) of WSB users for profit. So keep in mind that every post with for example a solid theory for the next liftoff of GME or a DD for a stock that reaches the hot page, attracts many users who try to bet against it, which is completely normal. After all we are a bunch of individuals. In the end of the day everyone has his own profit in mind, and not a collective greater good. And that's not a bad thing, but the inner core of this sub, which made it what it is today. 

So all in all, think about what you read, try to understand different perspectives, engage in meaningful discussions, ask questions, and don't spend too much time on here. The squezoozle happens when it does, or maybe it won't, who knows, let the time show it.

No proof or DD just opinions.¬†

1. First things first, what people have to realize is our society is based on and run on profits. (more so in America) Financial, health, food, education industry, all them big dogs 1% etc want profits. 

2. Now that you know that, they'll do whatever the fuck they can to make said profits. Some stay in the straight and narrow, the rest is that 1%. I get it, you want to make money, everyone does. So they find ways to evade tax, pay off people, make friends with higher-ups coughgovernmentofficials. This is all theory. Take it as you will. 

3. I explain 1 and 2 because it leads me to 3. Jan 28th or 29th or whatever, all I needed to read was some hf was suspicious of ""making things up to profit"" and unfortunately got caught by Mr dfv. 

4. 1 2 and 3 is what leads me to believe at that point that the squeeze is real. I read absolutely no DD and know nothing about stocks, and never read anything on wsb because I don't bet on what I can't win. I opened up Fidelity account cuz you know. RH. That was the other thing that set me off. RH, read 1 and 2.

I bet you he's sitting there shaking his head at us dumb apes. He can't say anything or else it'd be market manipulation or whatever and this would all be over. Instead he supports us via his other ways. Stay strong. Why stop at Wendy's when we can make it to the moon?

Edit 1: I get it guys, DFV has banked already. But still begs the question, whether you bought in at 40 or 400 a share, or if you are a broke ass, have money, or have LOTS of money, why settle for less? Wouldn't DFV or yourself say that? Honest question. Not a financial advisor or psychologist. I want tendies and lots of it, do what it takes to make lots of it, that's all.

TL/DR

* Dividends are coming 3/9 of $1.1 per share.
* Massive green [earnings report](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-Experiences-Explosive-Growth-Revenue-Increases-144-year-over-year-to-4.7-Billion-in-Fourth-Quarter-Company-Announces-Special-Dividend-of-1.11-per-Class-A-Share-of-Common-Stock/default.aspx) released on 2/26  üìà üìà
* Insiders own a huge proportion of the stock, greatly reducing the available float.
* A decently high short interest rate, along with 0 available shares for shorting.
* The   shorts are incentivized to close their positions before 3/9, so as to   avoid paying the dividend rate. At the current 43,090,000 short shares   outstanding that would mean 47,400,000$ in losses set in stone for  short  holders after 3/9.
* The CEO Dan Gilbert is [petty as fuck](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-ceo-not-stock-174605720.html) when it comes to short sellers and wants to put shove his üçå into their short-holes.

I'm not saying this is a squeeze because that term is overused as fuck,  but  I am saying this could explode into the 30-35$ range for a few days   sometime between now and 3/9. Get it while its cheap!

49,Actual new DD on GME that has nothing to do with shorts or squeezing,"Look, I know you all want the squeeze to squoze tomorrow so you can take your tendies. As for me, I like the stock and don't really care if it squeezes. This is long-ish term DD and it has to do with mutual funds. I know you have no idea what a mutual fund is. Just think of it like an ETF's step brother. But more boring.

Some basic background: MFs are measured against benchmarks, which are created by separate research companies to track sectors of the market. For example, the S&P and Dow Jones. Typically they're broken down by market cap, and then further by industry. Some are very broad, others are more narrow. Actively managed MFs which underperform their benchmark are sucky. They cost more, and why would you pay someone to do worse than you could just investing in an index fund?

GME is currently in the Russell 2000 (small cap) index. Almost all actively managed mutual funds with  that track that benchmark underperformed over the past year, and they missed the mark by between 5 and 25%. That's sucky. Even more so year to date:

&#x200B;

[Some random small cap mutual funds vs. the Russell 2000 \(top black line\) over the past 3 months. \(Note that this chart shows NAV, not total return, so the dividend distributions in December make the SMECX and WRGCX funds look worse they they were, but they still underperformed by a lot.\)](https://preview.redd.it/mz7cuosv5hk61.png?width=1754&format=png&auto=webp&s=303f3e473e8c73a4181fe6ced7183dc1baa3f641)

Mutual funds do not typically short stocks. They underperform by underweighting stocks which end up doing well, and overweighting stocks which do poorly. **In other words, they should have bought GME last year but they didn't.**

Here's where it gets juicy. GME is currently trading in mid- to large-cap territory. If it stays up there going into June, it will be moved from the Russell 2000 small cap into the Russell 1000 large cap index when they rebalance (rebalancing is already a planned event). **That is an extremely bullish event for a stock.** TSLA moved from about $450 to $900 when it entered the S&P 500 toward the end of last year.

&#x200B;

[TSLA moved from about $450 to almost $900 peak after the announcement it would be added to the S&P 500 last November.](https://preview.redd.it/r3ec16o06hk61.png?width=1758&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3e90b334c2d1013d0320d78a736d2e82ca465b0)

I believe this is a really important reason why GME jumped so high last week. $60-$90 per share is no-mans land for GME, because if it says much above $50 it's likely to be moved up to the large index, which would mean the funds which track larger-cap stocks would be buying up shares. If it stays below $50, it's likely to stay where it is in the Russell 2000. This is why GME is so volatile between $50 and $100, because it has to go one way or the other.

&#x200B;

[GME always rapidly moves out of the $60-$90 range.](https://preview.redd.it/nfqbnqrn6hk61.png?width=1682&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ebe5b9c21b551526a4b1e08c88b8caa250c6ad9)

Back to the mutual funds. If GME graduates to the Russell 1000 they will be locked into their underperformance because they missed the move from $4-$40. Some may have bought the dip in February, but it's not enough. Active large cap funds may already be speculating on GME graduating in June, and could be a large source of the current upward price pressure. No matter what, this scenario is bullish because if GME drops back below $50, the small cap funds will want to pick up more shares to try to get back into alignment with the benchmark.

I have to credit Barron's for some of this info on the mutual funds, but they seem to be üåàüêª on GME, so they just called it volatility and failed to draw the bullish connection: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-stock-volatility-could-get-even-worse-heres-why-51614360082](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-stock-volatility-could-get-even-worse-heres-why-51614360082)",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvjlis/actual_new_dd_on_gme_that_has_nothing_to_do_with/,1614630437.0,204,204,0

You don‚Äôt need to make perfect profit to change your life.


There is a lot of quality looking DD recently and if you are like me, completely new to investing in 2021 then you are very naive and inexperienced. Some of the stuff i have seen has been eye opening into how much I didn‚Äôt know could happen in investing and wallstreet.


This goes from the psychological warfare, manipulation of reporting and broker activity behind the scenes but also just general information around how the investment sphere works. 


There is so much content here, also in daily discussions about different stocks, gme, amc, bb, pltr, nok, silver, and even other stuff like bots and shills and the whole moderator drama.


Fuck me so much shit has happened. Even that 99% retard where there is now a conspiracy around their dd and a conspiracy about the critique of their dd. 


There is so many opinions and quality looking DD of DD that if you are like me it is completely overwhelming, but i trust the reason why i made my investment and I understand the maths behind it.
I understand the best way to get a return on my investment is to buy the stock i want to and just hold until i see a number I‚Äôm happy to sell for without over leveraging myself.


If you are like me and you started this wild ride of investing for the first time and like me you were retarded enough to go balls deep in gme 2021, just relax. Pick a number you want to sell for and wait for it, its that simple.


If you believe in the reason you invested, nothing you read should change that. 
Forget about missing the squeeze, forget about short interest and ladder attacks and all these other complications.


Focus on remembering why you believe in your investment and hold until you are happy to sell. 
You don‚Äôt need to make perfect profit to change your life.

89,The case for GME through analysis of... Pok√©mon.,"This DD was requested as a standalone post by u/summersittingshotgun.

I did some fundamental analysis by watching the series Pok√©mon. It seems like the stars have aligned, because I found out there's a Team ROCKET that's leaping for the STARS. Also, they have a talking cat and that corresponds with THE roaring kitty, who can also talk. Furthermore, I can conclude the protagonist Ash Ketchum has a Pok√©mon called PRIMEAPE, which matches the description of us. Said protagonist also happens to own a Pok√©mon which is his MAIN POSITION called Pikachu. Said Pikachu refuses to evolve to a different evolution, which means said Pikachu is HOLDING his current position.

u/firebird22x mentioned the company that sells the Pok√©mon games.... GMEfreak.

Protagonist Ash Ketchum has a friends group of two people at the same time: either Misty, Brock, or some other characteristic beings. Both friends have two hands each, meaning they can hold things together even firmer, like Ash's firm, hard, and long position in GME.

Now, here comes the juiciest detail I found. What do you get when you rearrange the letters P O K E M O N?

PKE MOON

PKE is an abbreviation of POTENTIAL KINETIC ENERGY, which means whenever something is in motion, it has kinetic energy. Whereas energy stored in an object because of the position it is in is potential energy.

Basically: energy moving GME to the MOON.

Mind. Blown.

This complete and thorough analysis has led to me confirming my bias. I knew I was onto something when I heard the theme song and the quote ""I want to be the very best, like no one ever was"", obviously referring to the squeezerino.

93,RKT is it different this time? Gamma Squeeze possible at 40% short?,"We've all seen RKT stuck in a channel trade.  However is it really different this time? 

Consider the strategy here. 

RKT has a blowout earnings.  

Rocket board announces 1 billion buyback. 

Rocket has 1.11 special dividend announced for March 8th close paid on March 23rd. 

Anyone holding short will and must pay 1.11 dividend.  

It would be in RKT's best interest to buyback shares before March 9th.  This means they pay less of the special dividend while Short interest is nailed.  

Anyone holding In the money calls can exorcise options to then hold stock and receive the $1.11 special dividend. 

&#x200B;

Thoughts?  Do we break out of the channel now to the updside?

108,"WSB saved my brother's life! After being wounded in Iraq, and severe PTSD, a purpose and hope made all the difference! Thank you!","My brother and I were both soldiers, but he didn't make it out uninjured. He was assigned to Bagdad, and was a turret gunner in a quick response unit. On a slow day, as they were rounding a corner near a square, an IED was triggered sending the humvee into the air and catapulting him 60ft. They thought he was dead, and after securing the area realized he was alive. They flew him to Germany, then to Walter Reed, where he eventually wore up and was told he'd never walk, and that they had resected some of his lover and intestines.

After a year in a wheel chair, and working hard every day, he was able to walk again, then run. I remember him telling me he couldn't wait to get back to his unit. The Army medically retired him though, and he went into a deep depression, with which he struggled for a number of years. He eventually graduated from college with an engineering degree, but his accomplishments were overshadowed by his PTSD.

About 2 months ago, i showed him r/wallstreetbets and the dd that people were doing on the gme stock. He YOLO'd his savings and sold half at 302,giving him enough to pay off his mortgage! E talk everyday, and he just got an amazing job 2 weeks ago doing R&D in his major. He is focused, heavily invested in gme, and doesn't care what the price does. He likes the stock , and the community here have been encouraging and uplifting.

Fellow Autists,   
With the coronavirus pandemic ground-pounding the travel industry, I decided to buy into a bunch of  travel stocks, and now about 1 year since the pandemic started I have been getting non-stop adverts from Royal (RCL) and CCL. So I decided to quote some just for shits & giggles, and have found out that CCL is now barely cheaper than RCL with all their discounts. I've always heard that CCL was the least impressive of the two, so with prices that are barely cheaper what would prevent CCL from crashing if people decide to book with RCL or even Norwegian with all that stimmy $$, once travel resumes?

130,More Ways to Fuck Bears,"Alright, degenerates. Hope you‚Äôre all feeling good, it was a bullish as hell day for the entire market, and to my fucking relief it wasn‚Äôt ridiculously volatile. I can‚Äôt handle that volatility, my little heart is beating hard enough trying to get my fat ass out of my parent‚Äôs basement at least once a day so I can get some fucking food.

So, I wanna say, I‚Äôm long on GameStop and AMC- in fact, my net worth is almost entirely from those two stocks. I started with $3k in December and am now sitting on a cool $130k, and I‚Äôm feeling fucking good about it. However, I want to take a moment to do a little bit of teaching.

You know how when you‚Äôre YOLOing your entire net worth on GME and AMC calls expiring this week, you have to put money down, and it‚Äôs a fucking shit ton of money if you were to buy a call outside of this week? Who does that money go to? That‚Äôs right, üåà üêª. Now, what if I were to tell you that you could be just as bullish, set up the ability to AUTOMATICALLY AVERAGE DOWN if the stock crashes, and get paid for the right to do it?

It exists, and it‚Äôs fucking simple: The cash-covered put. Now, you‚Äôre already bullish on AMC, right? Okay. You have your 1000 shares, you‚Äôre feeling good, but you still have 10k sitting outside of the market. You don‚Äôt care about any other stocks, what, you are supposed to look at more numbers next to more than two sets of three letters? Fuck off.

Here‚Äôs how this would work. Look at AMC right now. It‚Äôs above $9 per share, and it‚Äôs not going to fucking go back down. That would be stupid. Stocks. Only. Go. Up.

Here‚Äôs what you can do: Tomorrow morning around 9:30AM EST, you look at the fucking stock and you open up the option chain and you pick the $9 Strike Put Expiring this Friday and you hit the sell button and you sell ten puts expiring this Friday, that‚Äôs 1000 shares worth. And what happens, do you ask?

Well, you get paid a premium of $1000 to sell that put. That‚Äôs right, the bears are paying you now for the right to lose money by being bearish on fucking AMC. You put $8000 on the line, and you can‚Äôt touch that until you either buy to close the put you sold or it expires OTM.

But, Ragnaroktagon, what is my risk? What happens if it goes down? That‚Äôs the beauty of it: If the stock closes below $9 on Friday, then you get the stock. 1000 more shares. And because of the premium you were paid by those idiot bears, you are in the green on that stock so long as the stock stays above $7.97.

And if it stays above $9 per share on Friday? You get your initial investment back plus a clean $1000. You can‚Äôt fucking lose. Either you get more of the stock, or free money. And, since you already own those 2k shares, you benefit from the stock going up with those as well, and on Monday morning you have liquidity again with the ability to either do it again or buy some more fucking calls, you filthy animals.

You look out of the window as you sunk deep into thoughts to reminisce about events of the past decades..

During the peak of the GameStop phenomenon in 2021, the market crashed in its entirety, with the exception of GME and a few other stocks. GME rose to hundreds of thousands dollars per share, as the Ultra Omega Squeeze of the millennium, unmatched by any since the start of the Universe, happened. The hedges scrambled enough money as they capitulated, trying cover their shares, but to their utter shock, not a single share could be bought. The shares then rocketed to millions as GameStop's market cap exploded past known limits. 

Throughout the next decades, the management proceeded on an acquisition spree as they transformed into a multi-national, multi-sector, multi-planetary and multi-dimensional mega company focusing on not only e-commerce and gaming, but also entertainment, technology and many others. With this new development, they have managed to take over the landscape of EV and AI industries and even Space Travel industry, and you can now take their Space-bus to other planets üåô and back.

Angered, the government tried to intervene, but GameStop has also taken over the military industry and managed to fend off all attacks. By now, GME is worth billions and you can trade in fractions of GME to purchase goods and assets such as houses and cars. 

You break out of your reverie as the car came to a halt. You get out of the car and head into GameStop Resorts World to enjoy a nice holiday with your family.

Yeah, true... except it defeats the fucking purpose because shorts will be borrowing your share as long as you remain on a MARGIN account. You need to call and transfer all your stocks to a cash account and then your shares will be recalled automatically from the shorts i.e. melvin and citadel and other fucks.

**TLDR; don't listen to retards and change your Fidelity account from Margin to CASH NOW before they loan out your shares to shorts you fucks**

148,The mass exodus from Robinhood and effect on Fidelity,"I was on the phone with Fidelity customer service last week.  Long time Fidelity customer here, and I wanted to try my hand at option trading, but I accidentally turned on margin trading and had to call to get that removed.

Anyway, the rep and I were chatting while he was doing stuff and he mentioned to me that he's been doing nothing but this kind of request because of transferring RH customers that had margin trading on by default and didn't even know until they switched.

Then he also mentioned that Fidelity had more new accounts in 2021 so far -- in 6 weeks -- **than all of 2020**.

Now, Fidelity is a large ass company.  The fact that they got 10x the normal flow of new customers mostly because of RH doesn't sound great for the future of RH.

158,"While the GME rocket is preparing for launch, hedge funds are likely shorting other stocks and placing calls on GME","We've already seen how badly the markets did as GME suddenly did incredibly well last week. Hedge Funds and shorters of GME had to liquidate other investments in order to do their aggressive short ladder attacks on GME.

Yet with all the action around GME, and with the current state of the world, if GME does moon, many other stocks will come crashing down as shorters are forced to cover their positions.

And this is how hedge funds will win no matter what happens;

They've already set up GME to take off with how much aggressive shorting has been happening.

When the GME rocket takes off, they'll hold shorts on other stocks while holding calls on GME and make huge money off all market activity.

And while GME moons, retail traders and other hedge funds/investors that got on the GME rocket will win BIG TIME.

Yet at the same time, many of the rest of the stocks will crash and cause many to lose big time.

I wouldn't be surprised if enough insider trading is happening to have a planned date for when GME will take off so that they can time the markets perfectly and make sure as few retail traders are on the rocket as possible.

159,PLTR: Info for you tards,"**TLDR: Long term hold, just now branching out into the private sector.**

Sup degenerates. Scrolling through the Daily Discussion for the past few days I've seen a lot of misery surrounding PLTR because it's dropped freakin 10$ a share in the past week or so. I'm struggling with you, but there is literally no downside to the stock. The price has gone down because of some negative media attention, trying to drive the price down in combination with lockup expiry that happened yesterday. TGIF and we're seeing some premarket action in a positive direction today.

But what does Palantir actually do? That's the question everyone wants answered. It's tough for people who aren't involved in the type of stuff the company does to understand, but there was a decent explanation done on Quora a few years ago that is still VERY relevant to the company, even as they branch out into the private sector. Yes, they are still heavily involved in government contracts for the good ol' US of A and her allies, but now that it has a solid foothold and has developed its software to be crucial in development of foundational intelligence in a variety of government sectors, they are moving into spaces which are going to be more profitable for shareholders.

So here comes the Quora response. It's from 6 years ago and comes from a blog that has since been upgraded to a full up website and this post has gone away from it, but it's still very relevant to the here and now even with the fast pace of technology today. **Seriously, if you are in Palantir or are thinking about getting into it, read it. It's a short read, and a good beginning for someone trying to figure out just what the fuck this company does.**

*By Kevin Simler*

I often ask candidates if they‚Äôre familiar with what we do at Palantir. Most people think they are. ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre that data viz. company,‚Äù or, worse, ‚ÄúYou guys do data mining, right?‚Äù At least they‚Äôve heard of us and at least they‚Äôre on the right track, but I cringe anyway. We aren‚Äôt just a ‚Äúdata visualization‚Äù company and we don‚Äôt do ‚Äúdata mining.‚Äù It‚Äôs almost impossible to convey the scope and complexity of what we do in a few short minutes‚Äîor to do so without taking the conversation to an eye-glazing level of abstraction.

The following is my attempt at describing what we do at a high level without oversimplifying. I hope that after reading this a candidate will ‚Äòget‚Äô what we‚Äôre about, or at least understand enough not to apply tiny labels to our expansive vision.The problem: implementing analysisAt Palantir we specialize in **analysis**.Yes, that‚Äôs painfully abstract, and I‚Äôll get to it in a second.In real-world terms, we are building a **software platform** that enables people to take whatever data is relevant to them and understand it more easily and thoroughly than ever before, using concepts that they already understand. And we are applying this vision, at first, to solving problems in the finance sector and the government intelligence community.The first important thing to note is that we don‚Äôt actually do the analysis ourselves. We don‚Äôt devise winning trading strategies and we don‚Äôt catch terrorists. We write software that enables other people to pull off these feats. These people, experts in their respective fields, are called \*analysts.\*So what exactly do analysts do? What is analysis?

>Analysis is everything necessary to extract **insight** from **information**.

Let‚Äôs break that down a bit.Information is easy: It‚Äôs data. It lives in a relational database or as files indexed on a hard drive, and you can easily run queries against it. It comes in two forms, structured and unstructured. And there is *a lot* of it in the modern world ‚Äì too much, actually, for current tools to make sense of.Insight is trickier. Insight is something only a person can generate, and understanding this is critical for any organization that wants to do analysis right. Thus the challenge of data analysis is how to bring vast amounts of information into productive contact with human intelligence. In other words, the challenge is how to *enable the analyst*.From the analyst‚Äôs perspective there are five essential features of an analysis platform:

1. First, and most important, ***the analyst should be in control***. In other words, the primary way of interacting with an analysis tool should be *human-driven queries*. While automated approaches can complement a human-driven approach, there simply is no substitute for human intelligence. Unless you put a person behind the wheel, the system can never be flexible or creative enough to uncover truly original insight. Artificial Intelligence just isn‚Äôt there yet.
2. Ability to ***summarize large data sets***. Some of this is what has traditionally been called data mining: the largely automated approach‚Äîusing machine learning or other statistical techniques‚Äîof processing lots of data at once and extracting nuggets that capture something interesting about the data. Unlike Palantir, traditional approaches have focused almost exclusively on this aspect of analysis.
3. Ability to ***visualize large data sets***. Here the analyst wants interesting and informative ways of viewing data graphically, to make it easier for him to digest. The analyst wants more than just a summary of the data; he wants a nuanced view of what‚Äôs going on*inside* these data sets: What‚Äôs the overall shape of the distribution? What are the outliers? What are important structures within the data?
4. Ability to ***iterate rapidly***. This means enabling the analyst to ask a question, get the answer, and then quickly ask either a variant on the initial question or a follow-up question that depends on the answer to the initial question. This rapid, iterative process allows the analyst to quickly test out hypotheses and develop theories about what‚Äôs going on in the data, and by extension to discover what‚Äôs going on in the world.
5. Ability to ***collaborate with other analysts***. Getting a handle on a terabyte of data, especially when it comprises multiple data types, is definitely more than a one-person job. Any organization that‚Äôs serious about understanding the world needs a team of analysts that can work together as more than the sum of its parts. This requires the ability for one analyst to effortlessly share the results of his analysis with his colleagues.

The Palantir approachThat‚Äôs what analysis looks like to the analyst, or rather what it should look like in an ideal world. (Current tools fall far short of this vision.) So what do *we* do at Palantir in order to make analysis this smooth and easy?You could say that we help summarize large data sets, in the sense that we have to provide the analyst with a rich library of techniques and algorithms. You could also say that we do visualization, in the sense that we have to provide the analyst with a set of interesting and informative ways of visualizing their data. We do both of these things, and we have to be creative and solve hard problems in order to add value in these areas. But we do a lot more than that.Probably the most central hard problem that we address in trying to enable the analyst is **data modeling**, the process of figuring out what data types are relevant to a domain, defining what they represent in the world, and deciding how to represent them in the system. At Palantir we make sure our data model (ontology) is both flexible and dynamic, and that it mirrors the concepts people naturally use when reasoning about the domain. This is no small challenge, but we‚Äôre already making it a reality. In finance our basic data types include financial instruments, dates, portfolios, indices, and strategies‚Äîthe same things that financial researchers think about, talk about, and reason with. In the intelligence product our basic data types include people, places, and events (all with associated properties), which is exactly the way we all represent the world in our minds.Data modeling, data summarization, and data visualization are the core disciplines for approaching large data sets. Human-driven queries, rapid iteration, and collaboration are multipliers, taking the power unlocked by the core disciplines to the next level. When these pieces are brought together in a coherent system, the result is in an analysis platform both very generic and very powerful.This is what we mean when we say that we‚Äôre changing the way people approach data.

169,We're Gonna Need a Bigger Float - GameStop is a Remix and How to Maybe Profit Off It,"Whether you are of the opinion that GME is a revolution, a case study in fundamentally broken market rules (naked shorts), a truly good company, or any combination thereof you certainly have to admit that it is unprecedented.

Or it it?

The specifics around the whole Melvin/Robinhood part is, and the new landscape of the internet making data (good or bad) more accessible to the masses will certainly be creating new rules about how the markets function. But, in the pure form of a short squeeze this is in fact a case of ""there's nothing new under the sun.""

Most have become familiar with the Volkswagen squeeze that occurred in 2008, as it has been touted as the most direct short squeeze comparison. Chart photo below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/st5n6zjngck61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0b5f0c118efebc43b115246a09e10744c01eee1

Tesla has also been compared to the GameStop situation but that was arguably a slower burn and to be fair had been on a steady march upward leading to the explosive growth in 2020.

But there is another squeeze that occurred in 1901 that might provide a better comparison to GameStop not in terms of its cause and setup, but the potential secondary effect.

**The Great Panic of 1901**

Leading up to 1901 the Union Pacific railroad had been on an acquisition tear becoming the largest rail player in the West under the leadership of Edward Henry Herriman and backed by a syndicate that included the likes of Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, Goulds, Ameses and Kuhn, Loed & Co. (read as ""people who don't like to lose"").

But, in order to expand East a key acquisition had to be made. That acquisition was the Chicago Burlington & Quincy Railroad. However, James Hill through the backing of J.P. Morgan (also read as ""someone who doesn't like to lose""), controlled the Northern Pacific Railroad and had similar ideas for expansion.

A back and forth bidding war for the Burlington Railway ensued which ended in Hill being chosen and Hill proposing a Burlington and Northern Pacific merger. But, Hill and Morgan did not hold outright ownership of Northern Pacific and collectively held roughly 23% interest. Believing that the $155M or so needed to gain the controlling stake in Northern was of no issue they pressed on with the Burlington merger.

Meanwhile, Harriman quietly began buying the majority of Northern's preferred shares and about $37M in common stock putting him within 40,000 common shares of control.

On May 6th, after getting tipped off of the activity, Hill and Morgan began frantically buying up common shares on the open market to block this attempt sending the share price from $110 to $130. Not wanting to announce their activity, great effort was put towards masking their buying and the general market remained unaware of the tug of war that was occurring between the two railway giants.

Believing that the price hike was artificial, traders began shorting the Northern Pacific stock.

Here is an excerpt from *The American Magazine 1907* to give an idea of the climate at the time, it carries some similarities to today:

*""It is important to understand the mood of the time. Ordinary investors had recently been worked into a frenzy as U.S. Steel shares were promoted and railroad stocks were rising fast on various rumors of insider accumulations and mergers. Lefevre recounts a ""raging public speculation in stocks"" while Clew talks of a ""restless sea of reckless stock speculation that swept the American people into its vortex, with all its razzle-dazzle extravagance.""""*

By the next day the Northern Pacific shares were up to $150 and short sellers were weighing whether to close the position and take the loss or to liquidate other holdings to remain solvent. The following day, that decision was forced upon them as the stock climbed to $200.

By this point Hill had successfully seized control, yet neither side was going to sell and jeopardize what they each believed to be the controlling stake. As the market realized there was not going to be enough share volume to close short positions the price climbed to $1000 a share. Fearing the deadline to deliver, short sellers began dumping everything to cover their Pacific Northern losses and margin rates spiked to 60% only compounding the issue.

This created a panic in the broader market and following the lead of the short sellers the entire market sold off. The short sellers lost somewhere between $40M-$70M in the mayhem but those who sold in the broader market dip got burned as well.

Overall, the total pain felt was short lived and smaller than it could have been. Realizing what was occurring Hill and Harriman reached a truce and agreed to allow positions to be closed out at $160 a share. This allowed markets to stabilize and return to previous levels, not to mention save some of the short sellers from ruin.

**How Does This Mimic Today?**

An interesting take away from this story that has some value in today's situation is first that margin played a key role in causing a broader sell off and second that the stabilization came from two whales calling a cease fire.

Today margin is at a record level, almost at the COMBINED amounts leading up to the internet and housing bubbles, even after adjusting for inflation.

Some data on these levels further down in the post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueSqueeze/comments/lpftk7/investor_gardening_101_know_when_its_time_to/)

So, should the GameStop situation run away to a sufficient level, we can expect the incentive to sell due to margin will work its magic. Kind of like dry wood building up in a forest waiting for a fire.

A bit of an instance of ""correlation does not equal causation,"" but it seems that when GameStop goes up the broader market does tend to sell off.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wb2hq9pqgck61.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=a603988fe3cad8c2ddc2e03ad205f3de2b1b83f4

Some statistical data I've seen from various sources keeps landing at about a -0.50 correlation to the indices with a T-stat of < 0.05, which means a low likelihood of random chance correlation.

Eh, maybe a stretch but I bet the inverse correlation gets stronger as GameStop goes from $200 to $400 to $800 etc.

*Now for the scary part,* in the above example two whales met in the middle to call an end to all of the madness. I suspect there will be no such ""bailout"" in today's case. A quick review of the sentiment around the GameStop revolution shows that convincing a diverse population of shareholders who see this as more of a crusade rather than merely a profit endeavor is going to be an uphill battle should the price keep rising.

And good on them, but should 1901 repeat itself the SEC may have to force some hands. We've already seen brokers take matters into their own hands.

**How Not to Burn Your Hands and Maybe Get a Chance to Profit**

If you are profit motivated, you could of course try and time an entry into GameStop if you expect the squeeze has not happened and that the best is yet to come.

But, assuming the above is a good proxy for what could happen, might that be the best way to approach the situation?

If you are on board for the revolution by all means take what money you can afford to lose and join the cause. But, for those dollars above and beyond this amount, the ones you have to make calculated bets with, can some second order thinking provide fantastic risk adjusted returns?

**The easy way** would be to mimic what a certain Bernard Baruch (a trader on the floor at the time) did in 1901. A quote from him during the panic:

*""On the Exchange floor fear had completely taken the place of reason. Stocks were being dumped wildly, dropping from ten to twenty points. There were rumors of corners in other stocks \[in addition to Northern\].""*

Baruch realized what was going on and he bought heavily in the drop. He knew great companies were being sold at fire sale prices and he took full advantage.

To follow his lead in today's situation would be to have some DD already done on companies you'd love to own, make sure the cash is available and see if some fireworks happen.

**The hard way** would be to actually put on a short. Which does not have to be done *prior* to some positive movement from GameStop. But ask yourself, in a selloff situation what is likely to happen?

Most probable would be a flight to safety. So, if you are a trader, going short growth companies as GameStop makes some serious moves upward may be the safest short equity bet. Historically speaking people are most eager to let go of those companies that have yet to grow into their multiples (think high P/E ratios).

Regardless of the method that works best for you, which of course depends on existing positions, risk tolerance, etc. the current situation has the potential to create a low risk high reward outcomes as a secondary effect. We already have a historical data point to look to and the dry tinder waiting behind that one was a fraction of what we have today.

Some thought put towards a response to this possible outcome may prove to be profitable. And for those solely seeing this as a movement, that secondary effect would still mostly be at the expense of the institutions.

Note this AM there was no problem borrowing either GME or AMC  shares at these rates.

**It was the subsequent week where the real squeeze should've occurred** (*if not for RH/SEC/DTCC/Citadel/etc...*)

I understand the ETF re-balancing for XRT also occurs MAR-19, *joined* with the heavy options volume could potentially be all that's needed to start the squeeze.  
However, it is still my belief that the squeeze will occur once the shorts have hit their regulatory leverage limit and SEC RULE 204 comes into play.  
[https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)  


The options volume is one factor, but I don't think it should be the main or determining one.  
I wouldn't put too much weight on this variable, please feel free to disagree and provide logical rebuttals in the comments.

For anyone that doubts my credibility, feel free to dig through my past posts.  
I still have a large position in GME and will hold until the end of time.  


***TL;DR***   
1. If you truly subscribe to the notion that you can predict a date for the squeeze, put your money where your mouth is and post some YOLO 3/19 GME calls. 

2. Options volume shouldn't be the main variable in predicting the squeeze in my opinion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lv2kfz/gme_comparing_volume_options_equity_and_closing/,1614582165.0,303,303,0

178,Big gains will only matter when you have good financial health,"Alright fellow apes, in light of everything going on with our glorious meme stonks, we need to take some time to reflect upon our financial literacy and health. This is so that when we‚Äôre able to squeeze the big boys out of their billions, our gains will actually matter.

[It is a fact that the vast majority of lottery winners lose all their winnings, even go bankrupt, within a few years of receiving their winnings.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-the-lottery/2019/12/27/742b9662-2664-11ea-ad73-2fd294520e97_story.html)

In other words, if we don‚Äôt use our gains wisely, they‚Äôre just going to go back to the big guys that are screwing us over.

So here‚Äôs some simple yet solid financial advice from rich people that can help you keep and grow whatever gains you‚Äôll be getting within these next few months;

# 1.) Have a strict budget.

One of the most common budgets for wealthy people is this ;

**50%** of their money goes towards **necessities** (rent/board/mortgage, groceries, utilities, insurance, transportation, etc.)

**20-30%** goes into **investments**

**10-20%** goes into an **emergency fund** they can access quickly

**10%** goes towards **wants** (entertainment, restaurants, treats, etc.)

Again, not everyone can follow this budget to a T, and some don‚Äôt have to. But it will be important to budget your income and gains into these four separate categories in whichever way works best for you so that you can have strong financial health.

# 2.) Prepare for taxes

If your gains are big enough, and unless you‚Äôre going to keep them all in a tax-free account, you‚Äôre going to have to study up on what tax rates will apply to you and your gains.

For example, if you get $1.5M, and the tax rate for those sort of gains is 33%, only use the $1M and save aside the other $0.5M solely for taxes.

# 3.) If your gains are big enough, hire a financial advisor from a trusted institute

Anyone who makes huge amounts of money will be wise to hire someone that can help them understand what to do with it.

So if your gains are too overwhelming for you, and your first instincts are to instantly buy all the things you‚Äôve ever wanted, you will actually be wise to calm yourself down and do your research on who you can trust with your money.

DO NOT follow the financial advice of anyone that comes to you. YOU must go to THEM.

This leads me to my next point;

# 4.) Expect scammers, beggars, and family to come out of the woodwork if you make your gains public

There are people who dedicate their lives to manipulating others to get what they want. And if you make your wealth public by either telling everyone about your gains, or flashing your wealth around, you will become a prime target to some of the scummiest, two-faced con artists on Earth.

Even family and friends can suddenly show up and subtly ask you for money. They may not be doing this on purpose or out of sheer selfish desire; it‚Äôs just human nature.

This also leads me into my final point;

# 5.) Prepare for your entire life to change.

Your personal, relationship, and work life will all change whether you like it or not with your new big gains.

Prepare for the transition to be stressful, to challenge everything you know and are, and for you to need to re-evaluate your relationships with others as well as your purpose in life.

Again, the vast majority of people live most of their lives working hard just to get by. Now that money is less of an issue, that changes everything.

# 6.) Don‚Äôt forget that you‚Äôre still human

You are not a genius or a God now that you have this wealth. You can still bleed, and you will die just like everyone else will.

This also means that your greatest satisfaction and joys in life will not come from your wealth or the things you can now buy that most can only dream about buying.

It comes from the little things.

It comes from giving.

It comes from living in and for love.

And if you forget about it, you‚Äôll only become the very kind of people that we‚Äôre fighting against.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luk9jx/big_gains_will_only_matter_when_you_have_good/,1614530542.0,4414,4414,0
179,Which Call Contracts Creates The Best Chances For Another Gamma Squeeze,"In the first GME squeeze, we saw 4 gamma squeezes leading up to the climax in late Jan early Feb. These squeezes took place over the course of the whole month of Jan. Starting with the squeeze that shot the price up from 20 to 50, then to 100 and then two more in the weeks leading up to Robinhood fucking us.

The gamma squeeze worked as a catalyst the first time around and it's probably our biggest ally going into this second run through. Gamma is at it's highest when the price of the stock is at the strike price of the option contract. So the best way to increase the chances of a gamma squeeze is to buy calls that are OTM but not too far OTM. so with a market price of 110, buying up calls with strike prices between 110 to 160 is good. 

For a better explanation of why this is, read this: [https://investorscult.com/2021/03/01/which-call-contracts-facilitate-a-gamma-squeeze-the-most-for-gme/](https://investorscult.com/2021/03/01/which-call-contracts-facilitate-a-gamma-squeeze-the-most-for-gme/) 

Also, one thing to note is trading your deep ITM calls for OTM calls may reduce the delta hedge necessary reducing the amount of GME needed to be bought by market makers. 

tl;dr buy OTM calls with a strike price near market price to increase chances of a gamma squeeze. And avoid trading deep ITM calls for deep OTM calls.

This information was made available to me by a personal friend who has a deep background in finance as well as a student at Stony Brook in NY for 3 years.

Disclaimer: I'm personally bullish on the stock just like everyone else is on this stock but I simply don't let things like ""I have a feeling it's going up"" or ""stonks only go up"" be a part of my mantra or analysis although most of you retards do.

The information I have available is from a 65 page financial and analytical report in regard to AMC that my friend made available to me that's only made available to students at Stony Brook and NYU who have access to the financial report database that accredited investors and business finance analysts regularly write in that rely heavily on the fundamental business analysis(dudes look to see if the company is good and give their opinion)

***Bullish Signals***

Figure 1: Institutional Ownership up 65% Institutions held 40.9 million shares at the end of quarter ended Dec 31. Institutional holdings in AMC Entertainment increased by 16,151,852 shares (65.3%) at the end of quarter ended Dec 31. Institutional ownership is now 71.0% of the issued capital. (**More institutional investors who are smarter than the average fuck face on WSB see fundamental/intrinsic value in a company that otherwise would go unnoticed since AMC is widely regarded as a dying company**)

Figure 2: AMC Entertainment is ranked number 9 out of 12 listed commercial services companies in the United States with a market capitalization of $523.1 million. In the commercial services companies it has the 3rd highest total assets and 2nd highest revenues.**(This information directly conflicts the bearish sentiment on most bearish analysis that AMC as far as assets and revenues doesn't do enough to stay alive from year to year)**

Figure 3: Quarterly Report (Q3/2020): November 04, 2020 Quarterly Report Analysis Q3 2020: AMC Entertainment reports 532% sequential rise in Quarterly Revenue AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), announced total revenue of $120m for the quarter-ended 30 September 2020 \[Q3/2020\], up 532.3% from the previous quarter \[Q2/2020\] and down 90.9% from the year-earlier period \[Q3/2019\]. Quarterly Report (Q3 2020) Compared with the Previous Corresponding Period \[PCP; Q3/2019\], year-over-year \[y.o.y.\] Revenue was down 90.9%. Read more in SECTION on Financials Q3 2020, FY 2019, Past 7 Years **(This information directly suggests that although AMC struggled in the past that it was making encouraging signs of growth)**

Figure 4: Rising Relative Strength: The stock has a 6-month relative strength of 81 in the NYSE market of 1,808 stocks, 273 units and 111 preference stocks which means it is beating 81% of the market. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ A price rise combined with a high relative strength is a bullish signal. ‚Ä¢ Also, the relative strength percentile is rising at 81 for 6 months, 98 for 3 months and 100 for 1 month. **(This for me IMO is the most apparent bullish signal in regard to AMC because it directly reflects the public sentiment towards the company itself & what I mean about public sentiment is institutional investors and retail traders giving the stock price substantial growth since the pandemic)**

Figure 5: The debt to equity ratio of 7.4% is under a safe benchmark figure of 50%. Moreover, it has improved from 40.1% a year ago.

Years Debt to Equity (%)

Dec 2019 7.38

Dec 2018 40.08

Dec 2017 31.54

Dec 2016 220.76

Dec 2015 130.93

**(companies should aim for a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0, meaning that the firm holds an equal balance of debt to equity. In a perfect world, though, a low debt-to-equity ratio - say, 0.30 - is better, as it indicates the firm has not accumulated a lot of debt and doesn't have to face onerous loan/credit interest payments, which is always good for the corporate bottom line. Lenders and investors tend to favor companies that demonstrate they're using less leverage and that they hold a more solid equity position.**

**Obviously, a business wants its income to exceed its liabilities. But if that doesn't happen, and debt exceeds assets, that's a big red flag for a company (especially a smaller, newer one) and could mean a company can't pay its debts.**

**That's why, when evaluating a company's overall financial health, and its debt burden, a debt to equity is a due diligence necessity for a company, and needs to be constantly measured.)**

Figure 6: Revenue growth has shown signs of recovery in recent quarters.

Sep 20 \[Q3 vs Q2\] (Revenue Growth) 532.3% (Net Profit Margin) -758%

Jun 20 \[Q2 vs Q1\] (Revenue Growth) -98% (Net Profit Margin)-2,969.3%

**(This reiterates my observations from earlier claiming that AMC has had positive growth it still has struggled to do so.. The reason as to why is debatable for instance most people say it's because their business model is outdated and hasn't strived to innovate as far as experience & service provided)**

Figure 1: Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 44.8 is more than or equal to 5, this compares unfavorably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

***- Joseph D. Piotroski is an American professor of accounting at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and a Senior Fellow at the Asian Bureau of Finance and Economic Research (ABFER).***

Figure 2: The stock is overbought according to the Williams % R indicator of -16.2, suggesting the price is close to its 14-day high of $9.83.

Figure 3: In the past 5 years total shares on issue have increased by 6.6 million (6.8%) from 97.3 million to 103.8 million. Buybacks have averaged 1.3 million shares \[1.3%\] per financial year. Based on a dynamic start date of 5 years ago, there have been declines in issued capital in 2 out of 5 years. An increase in total shares on issue is an unfavorable indicator in Joseph Piotroski's 9 indicators. **(this gives a particularly bearish sentiment because of share dilution which we saw again recently)**

Figure 4: In the past 4 years Market Capitalization has decreased by $3.6 billion (87%) from $4.1 billion to $523.1 million. Based on a dynamic start date of 4 years ago, there have been declines in MCap in 3 out of 4 years. Price MCap ($ M)

4 Years ago (Price)$25.43 (Mcap) 4,091.1

**(This shows the price relative to market cap which can actually give you a realistic idea for a proper price evaluation or ""price target"".)**

**This information isn't enough for me to place a bearish indicator for me especially with the bear information above.**

Based on all factors noted above (yes I understand there are way more that factor into the overall sentiment) I believe the Pros outweigh the Cons and for that reason I'm in.

183,WHERES THE GAMMA SQUEEZE ü§¨üò°üò§,"Still happening. The SEC gives market makers 3 business days before it‚Äôs a failure to deliver. Hedge funds and other market makers may try to manipulate the market to force the share price down so they can cover the calls and potentially shorts saving millions on their end. They may be playing the waiting game and wait for paper hands and others to sell Becuz the gamma squeeze didn‚Äôt happen immediately. An example of this is last week when the share price shot up to 11$ on Wednesday after hours due to calls being covered from the previous week.  Wednesday makes sense Becuz that‚Äôs 3 days after the markets opened (Monday) so we can expect the ‚Äúgamma squeeze‚Äù at the latest on Wednesday after markets close. Might happen earlier. Either way it‚Äôs a good thing for us in the long term making the short squeeze happen if we hold Becuz the cycle repeats. Price goes higher more calls in the money = more gamma squeezes. Eventually we‚Äôll get to triple digits and potentially 1000$ a share. For this to happen people must be prepared to hold for a little over a month in a best scenario situation. Please don‚Äôt be misled by ‚Äúdouble ur money tomorrow‚Äù or anyone that gives you a specific date. Although they are partially right be prepared to wait it out and don‚Äôt get disappointed when it takes longer than what you were led to believe. Friday almost everyone was saying Monday is the squeeze but did not mention the 3 day rule so a lot of ppl were disappointed today. We need ppl to hold in order for everyone to win and setting these expectations will not help us in the long run. Hopefully answered some of your questions and cleared some of your doubts.

188,Work-around for setting MOONSHOT sell limits with your broker,"So there's been a few popular posts about boomer brokers limiting how high you can set the sell limit for GME shares, despite the fact that other tickers are seemingly left to YOLO at 50x/100x/1000x sell limit prices. For context, here is a test I ran the other day (testing GME at 50x, then 20x, then 10x, and finally 3x) vs. a growth stock which clearly did not satisfy the same requirement/excuse TDAmeritrade gave for not allowing a high GME limit (""Cancelled. You are trying to set a limit at a price which this stock has not traded at lately""): https://i.imgur.com/FXO6nZP.png

As you can see, GME was denied at what was, at the time, ~3x. The growth stock, however, they had no problem with at a 15x multiple, a price which it has previously never come remotely close to.

Now, the workaround. I use TDAmeritrade. I can't confirm that doing this also stops your broker from borrowing your shares to lend out, but right now it's the best alternative I have found. This will likely be, at least slightly, different depending on which brokerage you use. For TDAmeritrade you:

Sign in > Hover over 'Trade' tab > Click 'Conditionals' > For Condition, select 'Contingent Order (Trade Trigger)'

From there, the first section (the contingency) would be filled out like this: https://i.imgur.com/RbmPXIN.png

The second section (the action), would be filled out like this: https://i.imgur.com/skSzd6f.png

Set as GTC + Ext. and it will have that contingency order locked and loaded for however long into the future you set it to expire.

------------------------------------------------------

Hopefully this works across all brokers. This is not financial advice, I just like the stock and think a $69,420 sell limit is *nice*.

As you can see, Selling PRPL puts has been profitable and their movement is fairly consistent in the 34-40 range. I sold 35.00/40's for March and then some 40's for April. I am likely going to hold all of these positions through earnings because I don't think we will move below 35, even if we miss. Once earnings happen, I will likely take most of my profit and re-open the exact same positions for July.

I have also sold some Puts on PLTR because I believe it has a fairly predictable range in the 25-32 area. I am not a Technical analysis guy so this is just my observation.

# WHAT""S NEXT?

For those that are in the play, if you want to lock in profit then now is a good time, for those that believe earnings will be good then holding might be a good move. For those that want to provide a little bit more downside protection, roll your puts out to further out months.

For those that don't understand options, just buy shares. Selling puts is capital intensive and not for everyone... Be careful.

I‚Äôve been watching people recently scream *100K IS NOT A MEME* into the void over and over again, so I decided to break out of my lurker shell for those of us wondering if 100k is actually a meme, aren‚Äôt sure where to set the sell limit, and are afraid they are going to miss the train to tendie town. If you‚Äôve been wrinkling your forehead thinking about this hoping a wrinkle will transfer to your brain, this is the post for you.

I‚Äôve pulled some numbers from the Volkswagen squeeze to hopefully give some comfort to those apes who (like me) wandered around completely lost about where to set their sell *(gasp)* limits. I know GME isn‚Äôt Volkswagen, but if somebody can find me a closer comparison, that would be great!

Go take a look. *EVERYBODY!*

I‚Äôve pulled numbers from the chart, I know they don‚Äôt line up with the values from 2008 (stock split maybe?) but they are accurate when used relative to one another.

Here we go.

October 2nd: $263

October 3rd: $277

October 6th: $292

October 7th: $287

October 8th: $294

October 9th: $296

October 10th: $342

October 13th: $353

October 14th: $352

October 15th: $390

October 16th: $398 (High $428, Low $382) --> **NOT THE SQUEEZE**

October 17th: $358

October 20th: $277

October 21st: $242

October 22nd: $243

October 23rd: $229

October 24th: $210

October 27th: $520 (High $635, Low $324) --> **SQUEEZE**

October 28th: $500 (High $500, Low $471) --> **SQUEEZE**

October 29th: $517 (High $607, Low $491) --> **SQUEEZE**

October 30th: $500 (High $590, Low $485) --> **SQUEEZE**

October 31st: $499 (High $548, Low $472) --> **SQUEEZE**

The stock then trades around $400 for almost another 2 weeks before starting to make its way back down towards pre-squeeze levels.

*BEFORE THE SQUEEZE*, the price ramps up to a peak on October 16th of $428, before crashing down over the next 6 days back to a low of $210.85 on October 24th, at which point the squeeze squozes. Once squozen, it squozes for **5 DAYS**. If the price rises and crashes fast, it *wasn‚Äôt* the squeeze.

*Please!* Put away your fears that you are going to miss the squeeze. If we get to the true squeeze, you‚Äôll have time to take a nap and still not miss it. Even if you went on vacation for a week perfectly around the Volkswagen squeeze, you‚Äôd still have almost 2 weeks to sell at ~80% of the squeeze average.

Is 100k a meme? I have no idea - but it *doesn‚Äôt matter*. The BEST way for us to get the HIGHEST price is to completely delete your sell limits, and wait for the squeeze to squoze. That way we all get the best price, and we don‚Äôt risk scrubbing the launch before take off. In addition, the HFs can see your sell limits, and will use whatever information they can against us. Just delete them.

Absolute worst case scenario is that you‚Äôre in a coma for the squeeze, and Papa Cohen drives you all the way to tendie town.

Now, (looks around) where is that lurker shell I crawled out of.

**TLDR**: The train to tendie town doesn‚Äôt just fly by and force you to jump off a moving train. The train **STOPS** at tendie town for a vacation. The best way to get the highest price is to delete your sell limits and wait for the squeeze to squoze.

Everyone knows Palantir is a long term buy and at $25 it's at an absolute steal. I have decided to reenter with PLTR 20/40c 1/19/22 spreads because the pricing is quite favorable. 20c is going for \~$10 and $40c is going for \~$5. Since $20 is a common bearish target, I think it's a pretty good floor. I wanted to compare 3 scenarios with you and sell the merits of spreads.

**$20c:** While expensive, buying ITM leaps is considered a safer and smarter long term play. Breakeven is at $30 and will most likely be profitable.

**$20/40c Spreads:** Buying a 20c for $10 and selling 40c for $5 means you only pay $5. The breakeven point is the current price (\~$25). A 60% increase increase in share price will translate into a 300% gain.

**$40c:** If you think Palantir is taking off on a rocket ship to mars (i.e. >150% in a year), then 40c shows a higher return after $60.

I'm pretty sure Palantir will finish out the year above $40, but I am not so sure about $60. With this chart you can assign your own price target for where you think Palantir will be EOY and pick the option you think is best.

199,Why I love the AMC Stock,"Sorry if my English is not the best. I'm from Germany ü§êü§£

A simple Reason why I think we should all go in AMC without nearly any cares about losses and hold it. 

The Value is very low now and we all know what's going on this time so we have a very huge chance to make a huge amount of money and even if this gamma squeeze won't happen in near future we will win or at least go out without losses.

AMC has many Cinemas around the globe and everyone loves going to the cinema. After the Covid-bullshit when they can open again with full capacity, the company can earn money again and has a good chance to grow again in long term and we all can take our money back. Maybe one month, maybe one year, who knows. 

And please remember the rumors about the corporations with Amazon and Netflix. 

That's why I use every penny I can get to buy and hold AMC until we reach the Andromeda Galaxy. 

But that's NOW. If Monday everybody starts to think like this and buy before the price reaches unrealistic dimensions to get it back, it can be a little more struggle psychologically. 

I will use the low price at this time to build out my position and enjoy this ride into the core of singularity like I've seen in the Interstellar movie.

If you haven't already, you should read it.

Linked here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)

Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and before RKT got the earnings boost, valued at MORE than üöÄüöÄüöÄ, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).

&#x200B;

Here's another little DD summary I found:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAbx\_2fOHNMy2MvLW3CFEhJDRUJGr69coTVSV3A6ip4/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAbx_2fOHNMy2MvLW3CFEhJDRUJGr69coTVSV3A6ip4/edit)

&#x200B;

If you were too lazy to read either of those, know that RKT has 40% short interest. 40 PERCENT. THE SHORT BORROWING FEE IS 80%

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/RKT](https://fintel.io/ss/us/RKT)

&#x200B;

This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by Friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.

&#x200B;

YES. YOU READ THAT RIGHT. üö®üö® 5 DAYS UNTIL THEY HAVE TO COVER OR COUGH UP THE DIVIDEND

üö®üö® THIS IS NOT A DRILL. WE HAVE AN ACTUAL SHORT EXPIRATION DATE üö®üö®

&#x200B;

To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.

This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's also targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.

I'd link the interview, but reddit won't let me for a DD post.

TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY üö®FRIDAYüö® and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK. Retail/WSB buying pressure on RKT would üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ it to the ABSOLUTE üåïüåïüåï.

&#x200B;

I personally imagine an epic runup until Friday, which could then also pop a gamma squeeze while we're at it.

&#x200B;

The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.

Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 109, $35 C 1/21/2022 x5.

I will personally be buying any dips that occur if I find an exit opportunity for my other positions. Maybe do some averaging up üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Not financial advice üöÄüöÄüöÄ

&#x200B;

EDIT: If you're confused about why 3/5 when the ex-dividend date is 3/9, here is a source to my claim that because of T+2 settlement you must own by Friday.

[https://finance.zacks.com/settlement-date-occur-before-exdividend-date-receive-dividend-6289.html](https://finance.zacks.com/settlement-date-occur-before-exdividend-date-receive-dividend-6289.html)

Ex-Dividend Date

One factor complicating the discussion of the dividend date is settlement. When you purchase a stock, it takes three business days for ownership to be transferred. This transfer of ownership is referred to as settlement. Therefore, you have to purchase the stock at least three business days before the record date to receive a dividend. Assume the record date is June 4. If you buy the stock on June 1, you will own it on June 4 and be entitled to receive a dividend. However, if you buy it on Tuesday or later, ownership transfer will occur after the record date and you will not be paid a dividend. June 2 is therefore referred to as the ex-dividend date; in other words, the first day on which buyers will no longer be entitled to a dividend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lunv1h/the_rkt_is_fueled_and_ready_for_liftoff_launches/,1614539647.0,1923,1923,0

Market Cap is the last traded price multiplied by the amount of shares in existence.

So if a company issues 1 million shares, and the share price trades at $10, the market cap is $10 million. This does not mean that the company is worth $10 million. nor does it mean that $10 million has been invested in the company.

All market cap is useful for is to rank companies against each other.

Another way to look at it..

I could create my own cryptocurrency, and issue 1 million units. I then sell 1 unit to my wife's boyfriend for $10, and all of a sudden the market cap is $10 million. Only $10 has traded hands yet it has a gigantic market cap.

So I hope you can all see now that market cap means nothing really. It's only use is to compare and rank. It has no impact on our ability to hit $100k and beyond.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lv6r0q/market_cap_explained_for_new_apes/,1614597666.0,76,76,0
210,"Market Maker's Delta Exposure is over 25m shares, and how it will accelerate the short squeeze to legendary levels.","Yesterday I published my findings of how many shares MMs need to own in order to be delta neutral. However, I only went to march 19th as I naively assumed that there was not enough open interest to significantly affect their exposure.

I was wrong.

Their exposure is over **25 million shares.**

This can only mean two things: They own millions of shares AND calls, or they **ARE NOT DELTA NEUTRAL.**

Market Makers MUST be delta neutral in their position, which means even at the low price of 101$, they must own massive amounts of shares and calls or they must purchase them. This implies that Market Makers are walking the tight line of causing a massive gamma squeeze the likes of which we have never seen, or **half the float is locked up to hedge.**

If they use calls to hedge, they will dig their own grave as it will push the price higher as other market makers need to start covering massive amounts of ITM calls. **This means that if they bought ITM calls to hedge, it will accelerate the gamma squeeze.**

So, what should they do? Do they **buy 25m shares?** or do they buy massive amounts of call options (we are talking in excess of 250k calls) and **accelerate the gamma squeeze?**

I personally only see two outcomes, one as the stock rises it will become more and more volatile as shares get locked up to hedge, or we are the cusp of seeing a massive gamma squeeze. **Both outcomes will exasperate the short squeeze.**

First things first... I don't think this really counts as DD because I'm making assumptions based on a very specific subset of data. Second, this obviously isn't financial advice, etc. Third, I'm not a bot trying to distract from $GME, I'm in $GME 300@145, I just think $AMC is worth some cash. Fourth, nothing I'm about to say has anything to do with any kind of squeeze, it's just about the market and a long position.

Now for the opinions, gross generalizations and shoddy extrapolations:

In every downturn there is (at least) one thing that has always done well, and that's film. Why? Well, in my opinion, it's because going to the movies is a relatively cheap luxury. In 2000 and 2009, people didn't stop going to the movies. AMC, for example, saw a 4% annual drop in 2008 (April-March), but bounced back up in 2009 (April-March), and there weren't very many industries which only saw a 4% drop. People who could afford $350 Blue Man Group tickets in January 2008, may not have been able to afford those tickets a year later, but they could sure afford $10 in June 2009 to go see Transformers. Cinemark (Regal) didn't even see a 08-09 dip.

Box office revenue in 2019 was $11.4bn, and it dropped 80% to $2.28bn in 2020, because this downturn is different, it's not about people not having money, it's about us not being able to be closer to each other. 

Enter vaccines. I don't know when going to the movies will feel normal again, but eventually it will, and my guess is it will be sometime before the end of 2021. Now, there's a lot of big talk about what people are gonna do as soon as they're vaccinated: trips to Bali, trips to Majorca, licking doorknobs... But who really has the funds to blow on these trips or enough doorknobs to make it worth their time? Maybe some of you gain-porn assholes on wsb (just jealous), but for everyone else who got laid off, fired or is just still struggling to survive at $40k/year, where are they gonna go? To the fucking movies, and after the last year, we're all gonna be like idiots packing into Valhalla to breathe in other people's sneezes and eat popcorn that's had 10 different hands in it.

There's a good chance that I'll be totally wrong, but I think 2022 is going to be the biggest box office year on record and AMC is the biggest player. All they have to do is hang on a little longer, and they'll slay. With that being said, the stock market is a ponzi scheme where stock price can be manipulated and is rarely linked to actual performance (see: $AMC pre-2020), but I think people are going to be thinking about and excited about going back to the movies, which will push up the value.

To those who might be thinking: but with so many streaming options, who's going to go to the movies anymore?!? I don't care how big your tv is, or how great your sound bar sounds, it's not the same as going to the movies. I don't remember very many films I watched at home as a child, but I sure as shit remember going to opening night of Batman (Keaton) with my parents, because it was an experience... The excitement, the anticipation, the murmur as the lights dim, the fun of a communal response to jump scares... You all remember being around people right? Watching movies at home is fun, but it's just not the same as a night out at the movies and a family of four can do it for ~$60. Right now, I'd pay $60 to go to the movies by myself just to feel alive again.

Anyways, you all do what you want. I'm long on $GME and I'm long on $AMC. They might pop in the next month, but I think they're gonna go up and stay up in the long run (and I'm more bullish on AMC's long term prospects than GME, until I see a new strategy). I'm not buying for the pop, I'm buying for them gainz. How many people wish they would have held their Amazon, Apple or Tesla stock beyond the pops? I'm saying this next part as much for myself as for any other ape: quit obsessing over the ticker and get back to work so you can earn more money to buy more shares... If I like the stock today (I like the stock), I'm still gonna like it next month. And remember the old saying: what one ape can do, so too can another.

Good luck everyone. Try to relax this week.

(YOLO 34K),"This DD isn't filled with memes, calling you all autists and retards (which you are) every other sentence, or wife's boyfriend references.  Might be too bland for you all, and, whatever, fine.  But, at least it's something that isn't another GME post, right?  I miss the days of lots of different DDs.  Feels like ages ago.  ONWARD....

Disclaimer:  I'm just a casual investor and only using data available in google searches so who knows if I'm right on everything below.   Consult your financial advisor before making investment decisions :D

**Summary:  Molson-Coors (TAP) is poised for a significant comeback, with core brands (Coors Light, Miller Lite, Blue Moon) providing a floor valuation that minimizes downside risk, and new products and distribution deals in Seltzer, THC/CBD, and Energy drinks will drive potential double-digit annual growth, contrary to the conservative guidance provided by their Q4'20 earnings call.**

# FINANCIALS

**1.  REVENUES**

During a pandemic where they lost a huge majority of their on-premise beer sales in restaurants and bars, TAP Revenues only went down 9%.   Their core brands - Miller Lite and Coors Light -- actually saw increases in revenue in the USA, which offset major revenue losses in Europe, where their products are primarily focused on-premise sales.

Molson-Coors Beverage Annual Revenue  (Millions of US $)

|2020|$9,654|
|:-|:-|
|2019|$10,579|
|2018|$10,770|
|2017|$11,003|

It is my prediction that we see revenues grow in 2021 and 2022 to the point where they are surpassing their performance in 2017-2019 by a healthy amount.  I have numerous reasons for this prediction which we'll get into below.

**2.  EBIDTA**

Here's where things get a little confusing.  

Molson-Coors Beverage Annual EBITDA  (Millions of US $)

|2020|$521|
|:-|:-|
|2019|$1,637|
|2018|$2,502|
|2017|$2,514|

At first glance, it appears TAP is going bankrupt.  Right?  Holy crap! They're barely making profit!  Quick, SELL!  Hold on now....

In the 4th quarter of 2020, they slid in a ""Goodwill Impairment Charge"" to the tune of a $1.5BILLION write off.   This is a loss on PAPER -- not in real life.  They're saying their brands aren't worth as much in Europe, so they're booking a loss on their Brand name asset lines.  What does this mean?  Well, lets just say this -- that $521M  EBITDA would have been $2,021M had they not taken this impairment charge.  Whaaa?  yep, that's right, they were technically more profitable in 2020 DURING A PANDEMIC than they were in 2019.

So why did they take that charge? Well, besides ruining their investor's day when they reported Q4 earnings?  To put it simply - TAXES.  TAP basically did $2B in pretax profits in 2020, but thanks to their impairment charge they wrote off, only have to pay taxes on $521M of it.  The actually booked a loss in 2020 overall, which means they'll be carry forward those losses into 2021.  So they'll be able to avoid a lot more taxes in 2021.

So what the heck did they do with all that money??  on to the next section..

**3.  DEBT**

One of the bear cases against TAP was debt.  They have a lot of it.  Alright, so, lets take a look at their debt history.

Molson Coors Beverage Annual Long Term Debt (Millions of US $)  


|2020|$7,208|
|:-|:-|
|2019|$8,110|
|2018|$8,894|
|2017|$10,599|
|2016|$11,388|

What's this?  Holy smokes -- could it be?  So THATS where all that profit went.  Yes, TAP paid off $900M of debt in 2020.  Think about that.  TAP has so much money that they're paying off debt in an environment where loan interest rates are historically low.  In fact, right now, their Debt-to-Equity ratio is hanging in at 0.60 or so.  So, their Market cap is \~$11.5B and their debt is \~$7B.  Might seem like a lot - until you look at a competitor like $BUD - Cap: $127B  Debt:  $112B     Oh, shit.  Starts looking a lot better in a hurry, doesn't it?

Also, something to consider - TAP was trading at over $100/share in 2017 -- when they had 11M in Revenue, and over 11M in debt.  By 2022, TAP will likely have similar revenues ($11M) and less than $7M debt.  This puts them in a much, much stronger position.

**4.  BOOK VALUE**

Ending December, TAP's book value was $57.03 per share - that's if you added up ALL the assets and cash the company has and subtract all the debt and liabilities the company has.  The share is currently trading under $45.  I have no idea how this is even possible.  Look at some comparisons in their market segment:

|COMPANY|BOOK|SHARE PRICE|
|:-|:-|:-|
|TAP|57.03|45.xx|
|BUD|33.90|60.xx|
|STZ|68.88|214.xx|
|HEINY|13.30|50.xx|
|SAM|77.91|1028.xx|

TAP is trading at less than what the shareholders would end up with if you liquidated the entire company tomorrow.  this is seriously the equivalent of buying a dollar for $0.79.  Doesn't make sense (of course, lots of stuff doesn't make sense in the market).  Even if we were conservative and assumed their stock should be trading at 1.5x book -- that puts the stock price at $85 - an 88% gain from where it is today.

**5.  FORWARD P/E**  
So, here's just one metric you can go by to determine what TAP should really be priced at - but, it doesn't really matter what you look at, nearly ALL of the metrics you look at show that TAP is horribly undervalued.

|COMPANY|FORWARD P/E|
|:-|:-|
|TAP|11.24|
|BUD|18.12|
|STZ|20.92|
|SAM|52.63|

Again, we find that TAP is priced like it will not experience ANY growth, and is a dying company.  Again, even conservatively putting TAP at 18x forward PE, the stock should be trading at $75.  Not 45.xx!

**6.  EARNINGS**

Throughout 2020, TAP released impressive earnings, beating 3 out of 4 estimates - with the 4th only missing due to the goodwill impairment charges I talked above above.  Despite these impressive numbers, the stock struggled, revisting 12 month lows in late October.  Since October, there has been a 36% recovery -- however, we are still not at pre-pandemic stock prices, and as I'm about to outline, I think we're going to be hitting them very very soon.

Alright, I'm done with the financials section.  Hopefully everyone recognizes that this thing is very, very undervalued, even if the company just stays the exact same size as they are.

# FUTURE GROWTH POTENTIAL

The bear case over the last 5 years was basically that they were too heavily dependent on their core brand beer sales, which were slowly losing market share to craft beer and the hard seltzer frenzy.  As other brands like SAM heavily invested into hard seltzers, TAP was admittedly slow to join in the party.  With their CEO change in 2019, this all changed.  A well defined plan was put into place to turn the company around.  While they do need to play catch up in some areas, TAP is now LEADING in others.  In addition, they are making deals left and right to use their distribution network to partner with various beverage makers to deliver their product to millions of shelves around the country.  Some of these deals are getting them a slice of revenue in the markets they were too far behind in -- but for others, they're going to be market leaders in the near future.

Their Q4 report indicated that they have a plan for $1B in non-alcoholic sales by 2023.  Personally, I think that's coming far earlier - and here's why:

**1.  CBD and THC drinks**

TAP have teamed up with HEXO, and through their partnership have a 60% stake in ""Truss Beverages"".  Truss Beverages is currently making and selling CBD, THC, and CBD+THC beverages throughout Canada, and recently expanded into Colorodo.  They are slated to be a market leader in the THC/CBD Market, as there are very few competitors with the logistical means and infrastructure to deliver these beverages across the entire country.  With recreational THC becoming widespread across the USA, it's just a matter of time before these drinks end up available nationwide.

Beverages are projected to end up comprising 20-30% of the recreational weed market, and what better than a beer company to be able to distribute these products.

Their earnings call was very telling -- ""by December, they (Truss Beverages) jumped to the number 1 dollar share position with four of the top five cannabis beverage SKUs in Canada""  They overtook Canopy's position in the cannabis beverage market in only 4 months from launch in August. TAP is sitting on a goldmine with Truss.

**2. Can you smell what the Rock is cooking?**

In March, ZOA energy drink will hit the shelves.  Sure, it's a little gimmicky, but, fact of the matter is, Dwayne ""Rock"" Johnson knows how to sell shit.  Dude has 219M followers on Twitter, and hes pushing this stuff hard.  TAP is the one distributing this stuff.  I think it will be bigger than most people expect.

**3. Further expansion into hard seltzers**

TAP quadrupled their production capacity for hard seltzers in 2020, and are rolling out new VIZZY multipacks in March, and Vizzy Lemonade a few weeks after that.  They have a marketing plan in place for Coors Seltzers in 2021 to grow the awareness of the brand.   They're also launching Topo Chico Hard Seltzers and Proof Point Seltzers in 2021 as well.  Each will likely find their home in the Hard Seltzer market, stripping market share from Truly and White Claw as people continue to try new things and find what they like.

**4.  Existing Beer Brand expansion**

Blue Light Sky was the #1 new beer in the USA in 2020, and will likely continue growth.  On top of that, TAP will be bringing Yuengling to new geographic locations across the country (as a Michigander, this pleases me!).  They're also going to be heavily investing in marketing in 2021 as part of the USA re-opening strategy which I think is a wise investment as they can capture a larger slice of pent-up demand.

**5.  The Re-open**

Does anything really need to be said here?  Yeah, it's happening.  And everyone is going to go out.  And they're going to drink.

# OTHER MARKET FORCES

1.  Eventually, the market will need to come back to reality and price stocks based on fundamentals.  Not to say that it will happen fast - especially as long as there are stimulus packages and QE, but, IMO there is definitely a case where Growth stocks trade sideways until fundamentals catch up to their prices.  If people do rotate out of growth, they're going to look for solid companies with good fundamentals.  There's a lot of room in TAP for the stock price to rise and it STILL be a good deal for these people seeking a stable investment.  Beer is a fairly recession-proof stock as well.

2.  TAP will likely be re-instating a dividend in the second half of 2021.  This should help fuel that rotation; potentially before the end of Q2 2021.

3.  Michael Burry opened a position in TAP in Q4 2020.  He was holding 150,000 shares as of Dec 31, now worth around $6.8M.  This info was made public around Feb 18.  We may see some people follow him into the stock if there is a large migration out of growth.

4.  Around 90% of the public float is held by institutions and they've been slowly accumulating over the past 6 months.  This means a relatively small amount of retail volume / demand could easily drive the share price up quickly, under the assumption that institutions are likely to be holding this stock long-term.

They raised 2022 guidance and with the slack acquisition coming (I agree they overpaid, but not really), they are poised to take over even more market share than they have now - everyone and their mother's boyfriend uses SF in one form or another.

This thing continues to sell off and stick to its 3 month long 150MA channel which has formed a massive bull flag, since the Slack announcement. It has the largest market share in the cloud names and yet trades at the lowest PE ratio in the space.

230,GME‚Äôs price jump last week,"Okay so we all know that there was news at the time of Cohen firing that boomer running GameStop to the ground, however, do we really think it would create such a dramatic increase in interest? Probably not. So let‚Äôs explore some other reasons/catalysts:
1. GME Hearings probably got interest high enough again. Could have helped but honestly I only remember getting more mad than optimistic about our current standing. DFV‚Äôs opening statement definitely helped make our case and when he stated that the price was attractive at these levels it certainly got a lot of attention.
2. DFV‚Äôs double down. Now I among many of us was sick to my stomach from the blue balls I got watching it go from 400-40. So it was a great relief to me when DFV sent out his update and double down. Made me feel a little less of an r-tard averaging down as it dropped.
3. Short interest report. It was good to know but being delayed by 2 weeks doesn‚Äôt necessarily give us a rosy picture. Being that SI was calculated differently and we were at least still above 50% that was fine. But we never seem to have gotten a concrete answer on REAL SI, not the BS they sent us but on old calculations.
4. Power outage at Melvin/citadel/banks? This one I‚Äôm confused on, there were reports of a power outage in some banks around the time we started rallying again, I thought their short ladder bots could no longer keep the price down which is what opened the doors for us last time. Now this is where I‚Äôm confused. Did this actually happen, is this why it rose so dramatically?

231,AMC,"This is not financial advice**
AMC as we all know closed about the $8 mark on Friday the 26th (closed at $8.01). Because of this, over 18,000 call options were able to be executed due to the fact they were in the money. This means that 1,800,000 shares of AMC will be purchased as a result. On Friday, we also saw a call option volume of over 300,000 contracts meaning that hedge funds/sellers of these contracts will need to buy 100 shares per contract in order to hedge the position. This is how a gamma squeeze is formed. Through the massive amount of buys for this particular share. 

On top of this AMC is one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market with a short interest similar to GameStop‚Äôs. It is also one of the most active stocks in terms of daily volume. With that said, AMC had potential to form a short squeeze on top of the gamma squeeze that is going to occur this upcoming week. This has the potential to his not $10, $20, $30 per share but above $100 per share if we all hold our shares. There will be information put out to scare us into selling. There will be ladder attacks to bring the price down. But all we have to do is hold. 

Holding this stock will force hedge funds and those shorting the stock to buy at whatever price we are willing to sell for. If we all hold we win. There are now over 9 million members of this group and we all feel as though we have been wronged by actions on Wall Street and the constant manipulation of prices. But this time we will win.

The crazy thing is how heavily undervalued ChargePoint is right now. Their sales were $145M in 2020 compared to BLNK sales of $5.5M in 2020. Below are the price-to-sales ratios of the two stocks as of March 1, 2021.

BLNK P/S - 303

CHPT P/S - 80

Based on these prices, CHPT should be at least $90 right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvgso1/chpt_chargepoint_leader_in_ev_battery_charging/,1614624062.0,13,13,0
237,GME Gamma Dates Discussion REPOST,"I eat crayons, don't listen to me. Just like the stock and hold.

I am typing this on my phone while I am currently at work. Attempting to do some DD for myself and also anyone who would like to listen. I am fairly new to trading so all of this research is just to add the slightest wrinkle to my otherwise very smooth brain.

I will say that my position is small 3 @ 128, and I will also say I had 2 @ 300 during the January squeeze and I paper handed for a loss @ $120.

This is how I understand what is happening. Price action started a small Gamma Squeeze last week once $50 struck, call writers went into the market to buy shares since the calls were in the money or at the money which gave volume and the buying @ market drove the price up more striking calls all the way up. However, a lot of that was after hours, no circuit breakers hit being AH. Etc. Thursday and Friday was comprised of a lot of volume, speciulatively mostly short selling. However, that short selling could not all be legit as there was limited <1M shares available to short, so there must be tons of Naked Shorts.

Naked shorts have a maximum of T+6 to close out failed to deliver transactions. So the first wave of nakeds that were actually listed as failure to delivers will HAVE to be bought this Friday from last Thursdays transactions. Then the following Monday for Friday's naked shorts.

All in the money expiring calls under $100 that were expiring in Friday that were exercised before expiration are to be bought today? (This is were I get lost and don't have the time to look it up) I have found that the position of a call exercised needs covered the Saturday following the 3rd friday of the month. So that would end up March 19th/20th for options. However, I have also found that for equity stock options it is the Monday following expiration (TODAY for Friday 2/26 calls $100 and under).

So today we can expect a price spike at some point, also another spike Friday 3/5 and Monday 3/8 as well as more options hitting and hopefully exercising 3/5 in the money for more action on 3/8.

TLDR; I believe we will see an all time high on Monday 3/8. Due to naked short covering as well as Friday 3/5 options coming in the money before expiration from naked short covering.

Sorry if that was jumbled, trying to hurry back to work before I'm an unemployed smooth brain.

238,Great visual to plan rotations," 

Many have a process were the look at what has performed well in the past year and choose to buy into that.

The reality is that what did well last year may be peaking and may drop, soon to be replaced by another asset class / commodities / Sectors and or fund managers.

These charts beautifully show the fickle nature of the ongoing rotation. One years dog is another years hero.

239,Profiting from the Deep Freeze? PVC piping and Natural gas?,"So practically everyone I know or have heard of in Houston had a pipe break. The same is true of a lot of the south.

 I went apartment hunting and 95% of complexes had several pipes burst and lots of damage. Our pipes that burst were copper and outside. The whole city was a disaster zone with people out of power and water for days, clearing food off shelves in supermarkets that didn't have power or water themselves. I was collecting meltwater off my roof so I could flush my toilet until they opened up the outdoor pools for people. 

The power was also out for days for a lot of the city leaving people without heat. The only people with heat but no power were people with a natural gas stove, which is very uncommon down here. 

&#x200B;

So I got to thinking.....

Are there going to be enough pipes around to fix all this? Are people going to want natural gas in their homes going forward?

Is PVC going to be preferred over the less insulating copper? Are different materials going to be used for the water mains?

Could there be changes in building codes going forward requiring more PVC piping?

I checked into makers of piping in the US and although I found a few, very few if any are publicly traded.  I did however find some ..

..**manufacturers of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)**.

Westlake Chemical (WLK) is one of the largest producers of PVC in the US. It also happens to be in Houston WLK

Avient Corporation (AVNT) is a similar company

Northwest Pipe makes big pipes (NWPX)

If anyone knows how to purchase Silverline which is owned by Aliaxis I would like to know

Also Spears

**Natural gas producers** and 

ATO, ATXR, WTXR ONE gas

Any thoughts on other stocks that could be involved?

245,AMC Gamma Squeeze,"As a disclaimer, I did not partake in the initial AMC or GME or any meme stock rally from January, and I am not bagholding any positions from that rally. I bought into AMC 3/12 15Cs on Thursday and Friday because of what I noticed.

First we'll start with a brief description of what a gamma squeeze is. Long story short, all it is is there are a lot of calls that were bought, and those call options are ITM and are either expiring and/or being exercised, which forces the stock price to go higher as options writers now need to cover their position. [https://www.nestegg.com.au/invest-money/stock-market/what-is-a-gamma-squeeze](https://www.nestegg.com.au/invest-money/stock-market/what-is-a-gamma-squeeze) is an article that explains it in depth.

On Thursday 2/25, from about 2:23PM EST to 2:40PM EST, I saw a HUGE influx of AMC call options being bought, nearly $5.6M worth of call options, the total number of contracts bought was 22,740 contracts, were bought in a 17 minute time frame. I had never seen such activity in my life. This is where things get interesting. 15,539 out of the 22,740 total options were AMC 2/26 6.5Cs. The remaining 7,201 contracts were AMC 2/26 7Cs. 

Here is a breakdown of the orders:

**AMC 2/26 6.5C**

Total Premium Paid: $3,971,000

Total Size: 15,539 contracts

Right to purchase: 1,553,900 shares @ 6.5 per share for a total cost of $10,100,350

**AMC 2/26 7C**

Total Premium Paid: $1,582,000

Total Size: 7,201 contracts

Right to purchase: 720,100 shares @ 7 per share for a total cost of $5,040,700 

Immediately I thought that AMC was going to have an EOD rally and that these weeklies would print insane and that's why they came in with such volume in such a small time frame, but I was wrong, there wasn't any EOD rally. This kinda shocked me, because who would buy millions of dollars worth of weeklies in such a manner if it wasn't for a day trade? But then it hit me, these were all very ITM calls, and ALL these orders came in as **split orders**. For those who don't know what a split order is, it is a type of order for large securities transactions that is divided into smaller orders and it is done to prevent large fluctuations in the market price. [https://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/split+order#:\~:text=An%20order%20to%20buy%20or,order%20varies%20according%20to%20security](https://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/split+order#:~:text=An%20order%20to%20buy%20or,order%20varies%20according%20to%20security). is article if you are interested in learning more about split orders. This is when it hit me, holy shit, these calls HAD to be bought to be exercised!! Why in the world would there be such large buyers, within such a small time frame, buy so many ITM weekly calls, \*and the cherry on top\* as split orders just to stop the market price from fluctuating then and there? GAMMA SQUEEZE THAT'S WHY.

And this is where I wrap this up folks. AMC is still one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market, and AMC still has been extremely active in terms of share volume on a daily basis. On top of that, NYC movie theaters open up again next month too, which is fundamentally great for AMC. AMC had very heavy call buying for the 6.5Cs and 7Cs all week, with more volume being concentrated in the 6.5Cs, and AMC closed well above this on Friday (AMC closed at 8.20 to be exact). Those calls were most likely bought to be exercised, so many shorts have to cover or did already cover. This should propel AMC stock price this week, hopefully forcing an insane gamma squeeze.

**TLDR:** On 2/25 big boys bought a crap ton, millions of dollars worth, of AMC 6.5 and 7 weekly calls in literally 17 minutes via split orders, and these calls were likely to be exercised. AMC closed well above 6.5, where most of the call volume was, and because they expired ITM those contracts will be exercised and a crap ton of shares was bought squeezing those option writers and forcing them to cover, in such a manner that we should see an epic gamma squeeze this week.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lutnhr/amc_gamma_squeeze/,1614554707.0,524,524,0
246,Some hints to improve your broker account security,"Hello everyone!

&#x200B;

*First of all: I am not a financial advisor nor a cat*

&#x200B;

(English is not native language, so there may be some grammatical errors)

&#x200B;

Since a lot of people on this subreddit currently have invested large amounts of money, I thought your should be concerned about your accounts security. Here I have some hints to improve it:

&#x200B;

**1.-** Use at least 8 characters on your passwords, and it's highly recommendable to combine lowercase / capital letters / numbers / symbols. You can also use punctuation con the letters you use (√°√†√§√¢). This will make way harder to get your password through a brute force attack

&#x200B;

>Always look at the letters after the last period.  
>  
>Robinhood.com = good  
>  
>Robinhood.com.ru = bad  
>  
>Also all brokerage sites should be secured (Https not just http)

&#x200B;

**2.-** Use different unique passwords for every different account you have. If you're using always the same password for everything, you should enter the website [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and check if your email has ever been involved in a website data breach. If true, it means some ""bad guys"" managed to get the emails and passwords of the users of that website. If you're using the same password on all your accounts, this means they may have access to your mail.

&#x200B;

**3.-** Activate two factor authentication. This way, if they somehow get your email and your password, no one will not be able to log in since they would need access to your phone too.

Bio/fingerprint scan on hand held devices for financial apps works good too and it's easy to set

&#x200B;

**4.-** Be careful with mail scams. The owners of the website where you have your account will **NEVER** ask you for your password.

&#x200B;

**5.-** Also be careful with phising attacks. If you receive an email with some link to the website, ALWAYS check the sender email and be sure the link in your web browser is the real link (for example: [robinhood.com](https://robinhood.com) \-> [rovinhood.com](https://rovinhood.com) xD)

&#x200B;

I hope this helped you to keep your tendies safe :D

248,GME IS A MEME STOCK,"I‚Äôve seen outrageous posts and bets here recently, and people have lost money because they have no idea what they are doing. So, I‚Äôm just going to leave this here and post it again, or a long version throughout the week to lower this madness and save people from losing money. I honestly hope newcomers see this...

Tl;dr: STOP OVERTHINKING

Treat GME like a meme stock and buy on the dip. If you buy options, set the expiration for end of month/April. Doesn‚Äôt matter what the strike price is because of IV Crush. You can sell anytime without effecting the cause (always pay yourself, keeps your head clear). If you sell before stimmies, buy back in. Gamma is pending. 

Longer version:

There will be a squeeze and a gamma squeeze this month (March). Follow the money/word of mouth. The real catalysts are social media and upcoming stimulus. 

GME is a meme stock, meaning it does not function like other stocks. It‚Äôs abnormal. Therefore, it has high IV and is constantly in a state of IV Crush. This means if you buy options, it doesn‚Äôt matter what your strike price is. All that matters is the expiration. Set longer expirations for your calls/puts so you can sell whenever you feel like paying yourself and buy the shares to support the cause. 

GME being a meme is not a bad thing. In fact, it‚Äôs why we can do this. You don‚Äôt need an over complicated strategy to make profit here. The stock will rise and gamma when the little people are given 600 billion dollars to invest. Hedge funds know this and will use this as the opportunity to win the war. This isn‚Äôt new information. This has been in play since January, possibly even before. Why did DFV set his calls to expire in April? Why are hedgies repositioning themselves? Why did shorties call foul play against us in January? Play it smart and safe and you won‚Äôt lose a dime and will make unbelievable profits. 


Remember that we are small fish in a gigantic pond that has existed even before DFV decides to make his move. I can elaborate on this later. While we may be small fish, the great equalizer is the stimulus. Some of you don‚Äôt remember this: but shorties and hedgers cries foul play, blaming the government for giving people the power to take their profits because the stimulus gave millions of people the same buying power as hedge funds. Fueled by word of mouth, which travels at the speed of light because of social media, it created an explosion that they could not control, so they shut down the game. It will happen again. 

I think people are overthinking this and coming up with convoluted plans, when all you have to do is buy and hold. Sell your options, but hold your shares. Rinse and repeat. It‚Äôs what hedge funds are doing. It‚Äôs all there if you look at the charts AND the options. Look at the whole picture and follow the money. 

Cash app finally added GameStop to purchase, meaning ANYBODY can buy the stock, AND the the stimulus is on its way. Put it together. Don‚Äôt look for a made up catalyst. It‚Äôs right there in front of all of us. It happens with hertz, and it happened in January. Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of the Apes and social media. 

I left a lot of things unexplained but you get the picture. Also, for those of you who are spreading the word, keep it up and ramp it up before the stimmies drop. Doing God‚Äôs work (not religious just an expression). I‚Äôll see you all in Andromeda (galaxy far away because this is going intergalactic). 

This is just my opinion, trying to save lives not give financial advise. If it sounds this way that‚Äôs interpretation. 

I eat crayons and huff gas fumes for fun!

I hope all newcomers see this...

Edit: thank you all so much! I am replying to you Damn apes as fast as I can! Am I officially an Ape now? I love you guys and want ALL OF US to prosper! I left some things out like how ‚ÄúGameStop is a cow that produces infinite milk and that‚Äôs why shorties keep coming back to ‚Äòsqueeze‚Äô‚Äù but I thought it was implied lol my B. I was planning on making a more in-depth version of this post soon though!

249,A quick reasonable and logic explanation on what is currently happening to GME,"Hi guys,

all the following informations are out of uncle bruce latest youtube video. I can't post a link in here as the automod directly deletes the post but just search for ""GameStop GME Uncle Bruce Says I think I Know Whats Going On!"" if you are interested in the 17 minutes original video I got my informations from.

I'm just quickly recapping everything he says for those of you that are too lazy or retarded to watch the video. **TLDR and theoretical outlook at the bottom.**

Fictional example:

Hedgefund A shorted 1 Million shares at 120$ which means he sold 1M shares at 120$. The price goes down to 100$. In order to close the short position he has to buy back the 1M shares and return them to his MM. His profit is the difference between 120$ and 100$ times 1M: 20M $. In theory this sounds pretty simple but buying back 1M shares in a tightly packed and balanced buyers/sellers market causes a huge overhang in favor of the buyer side. More buyers then sellers = stonk goes up. By the time you bought 400.000 individual shares back, the price has gone back up to 125$ because people notice there is a huge whale buying a lot of shares. If you would keep on buying back all your shares until you reached your 1M shares to close your short position you have driven the price up to 135$ (just an example). Your average price is somewhere around 125-130 $ (again just a guess don't nail me on this one). The whole maneuver now costs you around 5-10M $ because your average buy back price is higher then your original short position. **You can't do that because your short position is so large that closing it would require you to buy so many shares that the stock goes above your short entry point which makes the deal nonsense.**

What you do instead: you go to the chicago option exchange and you get 20.000 ITM calls @, for example; 60$ which expire tonight. Normally such amounts of calls aren't exercised because most of the people don't exercise their shares because they don't have the money to do so but you are a massive HF you shit millions a month. As those calls aren't properly hedged because everyone is greedy and nobody thought that this meme-stock would actually rise again, the option MM now has to deliver 2M shares to HF A. They might have a quarter of those 2M but they still have to buy 1,5M back from the market. HF A uses 1M shares to close his short position and with the other 1 M he goes long because he somehow knows that the option guys fucked up OR because he knows that other shorters are doing the same. HF B, C, D also get a a lot of calls to close their short positions at whatever price. Suddenly there are a lot of calls getting exercised. Many option MM have to buy back shares at the market. HF A waits for the option MM to buy all the shares for their calls which drives up the price. Option MM then deliver the 2M shares. HF A closes his short position and sells the other million of shares while price is going up to 170-200 because other option MM are keeping the buying power coming. They closed their short position and made additional bucks through their newly gained long position.

Many people in here are assuming that most of the options get hedged but this doesn't seem to be the case. Otherwise there wouldn't be such a huge buying power of the last days. There was a huge 240M share volume in two days. There are big institutional players involved which are trying to buy million of shares or in other words: NAKED call options that get exercised in large quantities. There are several hundred thousand of options in between the 60-100 price range. As the stock went down throughout the last month there were dozens of million shares shorted at some point. All those short positions have to be covered at some point in order to make profit out of them. This big buying wave might just been a first wave of option makers trying to cover the call options that are used by HF to cover their short positions that were created throughout the whole month of february and in the end of january. This buying frenzy from option makers caused other options to be in ITM which were bought by HF just on the day of their expiry which allows them to close more previous short positions.

**TLDR for TLDR as requested:**
Option makers fucked up through naked/badly hedged calls that are now ITM and used by HF to cover their profitable short positions. 

**TLDR:** Insanely high amounts of mostly naked or badly hedged call options are exercised because HFs are trying to close their short positions that are several million shares huge, without driving up the price through creating a buyer overhang. OR in other words: the HFs are handing over the bag to the chicago option makers which now have to deliver million of exercised call options at a huge price range that they never thought of actually being exercised in those quantities.

**Outlook:** as I understood bruce right - this process isn't over yet. Many call options expired at the end of friday and if several ten thousand call options are naked or badly hedged then this would cause the options MM to buy even more shares. As the price went up to 100$ - there are a lot of call options ITM now, that weren't previously in the money. If the options MM didn't prepared correctly in advance then this thing could go to the outer rims of our galaxy. There were so much shares shorted while the price came back down from its highs at the end of january but all those shares have to be returned on day and you can only return back those shares through calls because otherwise the price would go back up. As I said - the bags just got passed on. If dozen of million of shares are shorted throughout a whole month where the price goes down to 40$ then all those short positions still have to be closed. On paper those million big short positions made hundred millions of dollars but buying back dozens of million shares creates such a huge buyer overhang that someone has to pay the price for those millions of shares being shorted. From my understanding. If you buy a option then you are making a bet with someone else. Your counterpart is the option MMs in chicago. Through buying a call at 60 dollars you are betting that the price of the stock is higher as 60 dollars at the expiry date. If the price makes it up higher than 60$ you won and the option MM lost the bet and needs to pay for his losses. Through complex hedging they are reducing their losses and on a total sum they still make a lot of money because they act as a big institution and not as a individual that either looses or wins his bet. If another big institution steps up and outplays you then you still have to pay those huge losses as this is part of the casino. Sometimes there is a person winning at the roulette table making 1M $ at night but several other thousand people lost 10M $ at the other table but what if 20 guys win 1M $ in one night. You still have to pay them. The losses of the chicago option exchange is our gains and profit because in the end we retail guys are just a small fish that is snacking off the still decent leftover tendies that were available through 2 big sharks fighting against each other.

257,BB - a long and factual look at Chen's hints and predictions during earnings calls,"It's weekend, going outside is illegal, and I'm bored. I started my own DD into BB by looking up the most relevant recent information. If y'all don't feel like reading through the earnings calls transcripts, etc, I've put together a little summary. :) Figured I might as well post it here - if only for my personal records/safekeeping. (Automod deletes posts with links to certain sites, so you'll have to seek out the earnings transcripts yourselves, unfortunately.) Enjoy.

 

**Blackberry Q2 earnings transcript, 9/24/20.** 

 Most interesting (to me) takeaways: they're lobbying the US and Canadian governments to get more contracts; approaching other governments as well; trying to work with individual states, though pricing is an issue there. Chen recognizes that his sales people suck - that structure is being changed.

 

**December 2020:**

The AWS deal is already priced in: the 50% spike in December 2020. Bullish articles from analysts: what if it partners up with Tesla as well?

&#x200B;

**Blackberry Q3 earnings transcript, 12/17/20:** 

Added a lot of federal government clients as well as the Bank of India and the Government of Rwanda. (How random is that?)

BB's AtHoc (secure communication) now owns the entire state of California.

Referring to the AWS partnership announcement: ""Combined, we‚Äôre able to provide a full end-to-end platform."" Hmmmm, this is probably just wishful thinking, but Amazon loves owning end-to-end stuff... I don't think they'll buy BB, but the potential is always there - just like they bought Goodreads, [Diapers.com](https://diapers.com/), etc.

BB's goal for integration in an actual car is 2023: until then, it'll remain in development. We won't see any subscription revenue this year or next, but there might be interesting announcements on more automakers partnering up with BB.

Annual Recurring Revenue is decreasing for the second quarter in a row. They expect it to go up when the covid mess gets better, meaning Q1-ish. Implication: it'll still suck in Q4.

Partnerships with Zoom, Verizon, and Microsoft.

Curious: papa Chen specified that his sales folks are using the SolarWinds hack (which didn't affect BB) as a big selling point. (Should we expect more sales revenue in Q4, then?..)

IVY beta version should be ready in September 2021. The developer version should be ready in mid-2021.

They're wooing 20 different electric vehicle manufacturers. Once they sign up, public announcements will follow if the manufacturers are fine with that.

Papa Chen name-drops Andy Jassy, the CEO of AWS - and the upcoming CEO of Amazon later in 2021. Says ""He specifically spent quite a bit of time on how this particular -- this relationship. So you can see that they are very serious. This seriousness not only come from the cloud side, but it comes from the IoT side also at Amazon.""

The IVY revenue will be split with AWS.

 

**January 2021:**

The catalyst for the spike to $20 was the news about the Facebook settlement. However, none of the details of the settlement were disclosed. (Articles don't mention WSB as the catalyst. Heh.)

&#x200B;

**My thoughts:**

1. The Facebook settlement news is interesting... That alone was enough to spike the price, which has since fallen by \~50%. Once the details are announced (on the 3/31 earnings call?), that alone might drive another price spike depending on how much money BB is getting.
2. Q4 earnings won't be announced until late March (3/31?). Sounds like they made a lot of new sales in Q4 by pointing out that the SolarWinds hack didn't affect them.

2a. More government contracts based on how badly the hack affected them?

3. Papa Chen might make new announcements about new electric vehicle partnerships at any time. I suspect if there will be big announcements, they will come before the earnings call, just like the AWS news dropped before the late-December call.

4. IVY developer version will drop in mid-2021. That might generate some headlines at long last.

5. This is the big one. Andy Jassy will take over Amazon from Jeff Bezos in Q3. Jassy is on record as a fan of Blackberry. That is huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge. Read the Q3 earnings transcript: papa Chen and Jassy have a bromance. Unlike all the other developments, I don't think we'll have to wait for years and years until we start getting some interesting headlines from the AWS/BB team-up.

6. Papa Chen has not given any interviews at all in 2021. As far as I can tell, he hasn't made any public comments at all about the spike and the crash of his stock. Interesting. The guy is smart and he knows when to keep his mouth shut.

7. The Facebook settlement. The giant gorilla in the room. We still don't know how much money we're talking about here. That was one of the key things (aside from WSB haha) that spiked the stock in January. That's still a huge wildcard. The settlement's details will most likely be revealed either before the earnings call (mid-March?) or during the call. I don't think it's baked into the current stock price because right now BB is trading at pre-Facebook-announcement levels. Once the news is announced, it could be nothing, or it could drive another huge spike in price. And if that announcement is combined with some other good news... Well, I hope the guys that short BB will have enough to cover. :)

**tl;dr** \- BB has **a ton** of potential. I've been averaging down and holding because I like the stock. I'm not an advisor, this isn't for educational purposes, this is purely for entertainment.

258,The squeeze is going to be way bigger than before.,"
1. Since according to IBKR and their boss, last spike was only due to gamma, means most of them weren‚Äôt even covering at the time.
2. Remember that they had to inject 33 MILLION SHARES(MINIMUM) just to keep the price down last Friday, alone that‚Äôs 66% SI if you think that they actually covered all that shit last time. (But if you thought that, that begs the question why did the price spike again, and why are they still using every dirty tactic to keep it down below strike prices? I.E. Cramer, short ladders, crying hedgies)
3. Many say that the 50 million volume during the spike was the squeeze but if you believed at least premise 2 which is backed up by data that is being monitored and cannot be avoided by hedgies. Then we had 140% SI at start, got down to 40% SI if they covered at all, and jumped to 106% SI last Friday on their push to <100
TLDR: Hedgies are fucked even in the worst case scenario we are 106% SI still. We ain‚Äôt finished yet boys. They could still play the long game and cover before key strike and sell prices are met though. What does that mean??? They know 800 was an important target for us so they might only cover till it jumps to 700. They know 1000 is where a lot of us may start shaving off so they might cut it at 900. 69420 is a popular price they think people will pull out so they pull out at 60-65. 
In conclusion: they may think their pullout game is good enough to avoid getting the ass blast of a century, but if that were true, they wouldn‚Äôt have gotten buttfucked to begin with.

262,GMEs inverse correlation with the market,"So I have recently been doing a lot of research on recessions, and it‚Äôs hard to deny that it looks like we might be sitting on the brink of one. I recently watched a video by Jake Tran regarding the striking similarities between the Great Depression and today. Rock bottom interest rates on the rise, the average debt of individual Americans, the number of retail investors involved in the market (which also correlates with Germany‚Äôs hyper inflation in the WW1-2 era as suggested by Michael Burry), and the fact that wealth inequality is at an all time high since the days right before the Great Depression. It seems to me at least that we are looming over some treacherous waters.

How does that correlate with GME? 

Well, as we have seen, anytime there is an increase in GME there is a corresponding decrease in the rest of the market. Whether that be from hedge funds liquidating other stock to fight the GME war or the general fear of investors of the implications that come with GME. It has now happened both with the January and February rises and is not a coincidence. The markets fell by as much as 3% in a single day when GME was on the rise. 

Now, there has been some talk of a gamma squeeze still in the making. I‚Äôm not sure about it, but some Redditors are putting the date as March 19th, or at least in the weeks surrounding March 19th. How accurate is that? IDK you apes can go find the DD yourself, but it certainly seems a distinct possibility. If it does occur though, and it squeezes into the thousands or even tens of thousands, the resulting impact on the market will be tremendous. And given the delicate situation the market is in, could very well trigger a recession. 

Now what I find interesting is what happens in a recession, theoretically pinpointed on March 19th. Whenever a countries economy gets slapped around it affects the global economy, and a crash on this scale would certainly cause global issues. Historically, whenever there has been recessions, war always breaks out. Almost every time. Not necessarily in the US, but across the other nations as well. Considering our recent forays into the Middle East again, I don‚Äôt see us not getting dragged in. I also believe the tense situations over in that China, India, Pakistan area is a powder keg ready to let loose as well (remember all those Tik Toks with the Pakistani kids vowing to destroy India? They hate each other). 

So at this point, given where we stand, I almost think it‚Äôs more risky to not have a share of GME as a hedge against market collapse. And if it all goes south and GME goes to Pluto, I‚Äôm taking the tendies and investing in 3 things: 
- the digital security that cannot be named
- Precious metals
- and most importantly defense stocks

The defense stocks will be at rock bottom prices and I‚Äôll be ready to catch them with my tendies.

Anyway, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, I hardly know what I‚Äôm talking about in this discussion. I‚Äôm just and ape with a box of Crayolas. If you have a wrinkly brain feel free to tell me where I went wrong. 

TLDR: It‚Äôs too risky to not own GME. Taking the tendies upon market collapse and buying defense stonks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lui4ui/gmes_inverse_correlation_with_the_market/,1614524836.0,1186,1186,0

270,"AMC ""BULL TRAP""","Watch out for hedge funds ""Bull Trap"".

Hello friends,I just wanted to start by saying that I believe AMC & GME to be under value at current prices and covid restrictions as well as NYC AMC opening back up.     NOW as we all know by now roughly about 120k+ (12 million+ shares) call options expired In The Money on Feb 26 at $8.01. The street sentiment is that AMC's price will be rising on Monday because the number of shares needed to brought to covered call options expired ITM. Fundamentally speaking that's how the price of a security goes up, buy buy and more buying, there is no exception here. If the price of AMC goes down by 20% after the HF brought million of shares to cover their calls that really wouldn't make any sense at all. That only explanation is the HF's decided to HOLDOUT for a few days so they can ladder attack to lower the price before buying million of shares to cover their calls.

Let just assumed that price spike up to between $15-$20 on Monday, this is an HF's ""Bull Trap"" so DO NOT FALL FOR IT & DO NOT SELL your shares, they will be able to use your shares to increase their short interest attacks and continues their ladder attack as well. We need to decrease the number of shares available in the float NOT increase it, by selling your shares you actually increasing it. It is very important to decrease the number of shares available in the float, that's how you trigger the ""Short Squeeze"". Why would the HF's buy shares from us at $100 if they can just buy it from the float at $10 or $15 to cover their short interest? Would you?

Example:

On January 27th AMC shares jumped 300% from $4.97 to $19.90 in one day. What was the reason behind this movement? AMC raising $900 million in the week before or the CEO announcing bankruptcy is off the table? the answer is none of it, it was the classic HF's bull trap, the hf was losing so much money in GameStop they needed to make money somewhere else, they intentionally put money into AMC to raise the price so retail investors would jump in at $14-$19 thinking the price would continue to go up. We all know what happened next, AMC tanked 65% the following day and people who brought AMC in at $14-$19 were trapped, hint the ""bull trap"".

I don't know what will happen on Monday, none of us do, hopefully, AMC price will rise to $10-$11, but do NOT FALL for the Bull Trap if the price rises to $15 or $20 if you sell your shares kiss goodbye to the short squeeze. Why do you think the HF vs retail investors were battling it out over 1 cent on Friday? Literally, it was down to the last minute. Those 120k+ call options were the catalyst that we needed to pressure the hf to buyback 10 of million of shares to cover their short interest.

""(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Saturday authorized Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, enabling millions more Americans to be vaccinated in the coming weeks and setting the vaccine up for additional approvals around the world.""

The approval of Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs single-dose COVID-19 vaccine couldn't happen at a better time for AMC shareholders. The last time vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized back on November 7th AMC shoots up to 90% and closed over 50% for the day. All the weeds, airlines, hotels, and housing-related stocks were also up 20%-30% as well.

A new vaccine approved and millions of shares buyback, it will be very interesting how this played out on Monday.

278,Gamma squeeze has nothing to do with expiration,"When a market maker sells you a call, they simultaneously buy the stock at the same time (well, they‚Äôre supposed to). If they don‚Äôt, they have huge risk exposure and would have to buy to hedge as price increases. The amount they buy depends on volatility and changes day to day. That‚Äôs called delta neutral hedging. For simplicity, i used a 1:1 hedge, but in reality delta dictates the amount of shares for the hedge. When enough calls are bought, this drives buying. This is the gamma squeeze. Most options are closed before expiration. Traders generally have no interest in exercising options and owning shares. What people fail to understand, is that the market maker already purchased the shares that would have to be sold to the option buyer if they did choose to exercise (unless they‚Äôre naked selling, which would be bad business for them and could bankrupt them). If they didn‚Äôt, and they sold you naked calls, they put themselves in a bad spot. They‚Äôd be on the hook to buy the shares if the names calls skyrocket. That purchase happened already. At exercise, you simply take the shares from the market maker and pay him the strike price for them. They aren‚Äôt bought on the open market, driving up the share price. That‚Äôs not how it works. Now, the reason why you see such volatility on Friday‚Äôs, is because traders are closing out their trades. When they sell the calls back to close the trade, the market maker then sells their shares back to the open market, driving the price down (it‚Äôs not always ‚Äúomg the shorts are doing a ladder attack!!‚Äù). Gamma squeeze happens at the time the calls are purchased because market maker is hedging to be delta neutral, not at expiration. Nobody is buying 40 million shares Monday morning because options expired ITM.

HF have gone all in trying to get these two trampled down to get them on the cheap side which leaves me questiong why? And what does a brick and mortar and cinema chain have in common that makes them go out of their way to get em on the cheap end, economy i feel is a so so, they are ok\`ish there.

This leaves me with land and property, the one thing more valuable than gold and diamonds. Both are enormous on that side, and probably has some of the best locations money can by. This i can see the HF\`s craving for.

My father is an immigrant and is extremely cheap, callous, cheap, manipulative, and did I mention cheap? We lived extremely modestly in a wealthy area because they had good school districts. My family has often struggled to make friends of the whole family and my parents kept very weak connections with their family members. There have been many traumatizing moments for me including infidelity, abuse, and screaming that I have had to deal with since I was a child. In high school all of my siblings were moved out for their careers and education. Things started to really suck without them to say the least. My house has always been a complete dump. My parents and my sister have hoarding problems. Most of the house is unable to be walked through and has been for over 10 years. I have never invited any friends over because of how bad it looks. I think this is some psychological defense against outsiders, but I'm not sure. In my junior year of high school things began to go poorly and my parents stopped talking to each other for over a year and a half. I had to pass notes from the upstairs and downstairs rooms which they each lived so they could discuss things. It felt horrible. I was never one to quit so I continued on and had an amazing year outside of home. I showed up to school every day with a smile on my face and was loved by teachers and other people. I was one of the best students in the whole school. From then till senior year I won multiple awards, finished top % in basically every metric and was accepted to multiple institutions for tough undergrad programs and received many scholarships.

That brings us to today. My first year of college wasn't very exciting. I lived with a friend I've had since middle school and we explored the independent life. Sophomore year something happened, though. I saw an ad on instagram from an NFL player I loved promoting an app to make live sports bets. This wasn't traditional betting but rather a game that involved bets. I downloaded it and soon became hooked. I was great at it, they had a weekly contest I was winning hundreds and sometimes even $1000 on almost every week. I couldn't stop thinking about it. This was my own money. I had never had this money before. I bought shoes, a BRAND NEW iPhone which I still use today, and other needless things. After the app began to lose money and go broke I stopped doing it until junior year when I got into REAL sports betting. I deposited $500 of internship money into an account and turned it in $5000 in two weeks. I was hooked. My methodical strategies began to turn into madness. I would bet large sums on anything that was on. I had originally used this money to buy myself a car. My dad has a net worth of a few million but had refused to get me for years and made me ask my roommate to take me everywhere for years while making fun of him. I hated him for it. Once I lost my original $4500 profit I began to spiral. I used everything and maxed out my credit cards to bet. I had an obsession with betting the under ( this is basically what shorting is in the betting world). Soon I began to bet on things I couldn't watch: Russian table tennis, chinese basketball, turkish soccer, whatever was offered. I had to tell my mom what happened and she was in shock. She said this should not have happened and I will get you help. My dad sent me over 13k to pay off everything. I became so enraged I had cost them this I did it again a second time. Another 13k. I promised them it was over and after mulling they sent me the money again. Except I never stopped. I managed to stay alive continuing my habit by either needing money ""for new classes I'm signing up for"", coasting off of scholarship money I had to pay for classes, or getting lucky and paying off debt. Most of school I did the bare minimum and really only cared about my bets. Punched in live bets at the gym. In class. At Home. During Spring break. If I could I would bet. In January I had managed to pay off a 2k deficit and had 6k of money, in my hands, with no debt. Today I owe 11k. For just one second I wondered if I was even worth being alive. At this point my parents have basically disowned me unless I turn over my entire life to them. They don't know I never stopped.

This is where Gamestop comes in. I decided I would never gamble sports again and put my last 2k of profit into a brokerage. In late January I used my last 2k to buy 22 shares of gamestop at $88. I was lost in the movement staying up almost every night for premarket and checking my phone over 12 hours a day. I remember waking up to seeing 10k in my account from my shares. I didn't sell. Eventually I paper handed after robinhood stopped allowing buy of GME. With my small profit I returned to the market and built my account back up. Lost most of it and last week I bought 23 GME shares this time @ 116. My whole portfolio. Truly I don't care what happens anymore. I just like the stock. I'm not scared of anything and if I lose it all then I'll just make sure I remember how it felt to have nothing when I make it in this world one day because I know I will.

Nobody knows this, my roommate has lived with me for 4 years and is one of my best friends and actually thinks I'm doing well financially because of my early success. Today I watched the movie flight and I just felt like I had to get this off my chest somehow after watching the final few scenes.

I don't plan on speaking to my parents much again, they probably won't be at my graduation, and I wake up every day hating the decisions me and them have both made in our life. Right now GME is all I have. I'm here to shout to the rooftops why I'm here and where I'm from, this can happen to anybody. I don't want sympathy I just want to go to the moon. Apes strong.

289,"GME FOMO led to some research, hopefully can help others","TLDR; FOMO, still holding GME 140@$298. First time diving into stocks, invest what you can loose. Understand the data, charts reveal patterns and this looks like it will be a monthly cycle, until a crash, or more stocks become available(sold or issued by GME).

I had FOMO in January and tried to jump in on the Friday, we know what happened then. I didn't do research. I had cash and wanted get a win, but also thought I was helping to stick it to WS. Of course, got burned, but instead of selling, decided to hold, average down and try to get to a point I can get out with something positive(even if it isn't cash).

The only thing going for me is time, I don't need the cash (now), but will hope I can recoup the loses eventually. Right now it is a constant reminder every time I load Fidelity. It pisses me off every day to see the red(net loss), so wanted to come up with a way to help others.

I am a practical/visual learner, anyone know a good paper trading app that I can simulate the market history to see how a decision would have worked? Thinkorswim doesn't work for me; I need to experiment on a trade and see how that would happen with simulated trends. ""Realtime is too slow for this stuff to really understand it"" edit: the term i was looking for ""Backtesting""

With that said, this is what I am understanding from the charts. A pattern looks to be forming. Time will tell and will see what happens at the end of March. This is how I see things and watch the slope of the line:

1. Volume: larger bars then the previous trend(see below just before rise), if lots of green, those are large buys
2. OBV: The values are high, then a spike(sharp rise). If the level sustains, shit is about to happen. note each spike and how it lines up with other data
3. RSI: is running high at these spikes. when it spikes over 70 that is another signal, but if this crosses 30 downward watch out.
4. MACD: trend line is flat and the spread between signal line start to spread drastically.

Edit: per one of the comments below, will make my statement on this in this post. This will only help trying to find a good point to jump into a stock(not GME specific). For example, if you look at RKT today, with this new information would you buy tomorrow?

Edit: added the line about backtesting

I've been trying tp post this for about 3 weeks now but still as bullish as ever on LVS

Now, the pandemic has slowed down Casino‚Äôs of the like due to social distance measures and lack of tourism. LVS has casinos all over the world from Vegas, to Macao to Singapore. They‚Äôve been hit hard but there is a light of hope. Because, regardless of a recession, depression or a pandemic people will always gamble. They got no money? They will find $10 and hope it turns into a $100.

Here we go, let's get horns-

**Prelude-** This is the company that owns that Huge Building in Singapore shaped like a cruise ship in the sky and charged me $40 for a bottle of water with dinner.

\#1 **MGM was upgraded but research houses reduced Las Vegas Sands due to their Asia exposure?**

I am sorry, what? Have you seen Asia? They are literally throwing festivals in China, Japan, Singapore and Australia etc. If you ever been to Asian countries you will find that they love to Drink, Smoke and Gamble. I feel if you are going into Casino/gambling company you NEED Asian Exposure. I could continue for many points on Asian casino‚Äôs but I‚Äôd lose concentration.

\#2- **Dr Michael Burry,** He is at it again, its no lie, I love him. He only has 2% of his portfolio invested in LVS but hey, he only had 4.3% in GME.

\#3 **The House Always wins**. People are going to come back, business will boom again and people are going to bet harder than they have before and the house always wins.

\#4 Hotels, Dining, Entertainment, Conventions and Exhibitions will all be sort after activities.

*Sands have a finger in each of these pies.*

\#5 **Online Casinos**\- there‚Äôs been rumors about them moving into deals with online casinos- which could future proof any thing along the lines of this pandemic again as well as increasing their reach to a digital level. In fact they have targeted 888 Holdings.

[https://www.casino.org/news/las-vegas-sands-could-make-run-at-888-holdings-to-move-into-igaming/](https://www.casino.org/news/las-vegas-sands-could-make-run-at-888-holdings-to-move-into-igaming/)

\#6 **Investing in themselves** They aren‚Äôt afraid to spend money- they're about to invest another $10b into Macau. Quote from earnings call-

¬∑ *‚ÄúWhen the Macanese government makes its decision I think we will continue upon a rather solid capital investment which I know is how* [*Sheldon*](https://www.asgam.com/index.php/2021/01/12/sheldon-adelson-supercharged-by-asia/) *felt, to grab that opportunity with both hands.‚Äù*

¬∑ *‚ÄúThere is just no place like Macau \[and\] we‚Äôre not done in Macau. We‚Äôre going to be there for many more years.*

¬∑ *‚ÄúWhen all this goes away, I bet one thing that will happen is the Macau government is going to necessitate that licensees make investments in Macau and we want to be there and be ready.‚Äù*

¬∑ *Noting that LVS is already in the midst of a US$3.3 billion expansion of its Marina Bay Sands property in Singapore, Goldstein observed, ‚ÄúThese are not small investments, they are in the billions of dollars, so we have to be prepared for outside investments in our best markets, which are Macau and Singapore for crazy growth.‚Äù*

**#7 Numbers**

¬∑ Earnings forecast to grow 88% vs 70% industry/20% market

¬∑ Volatility over the past 3 months has been low compared to rest of market.

¬∑ Forecast to become profitable over the next 3 years

¬∑ Revenue forecast to grow 33% per year- which is 3 times faster than the US Market (10.6%)

¬∑ ROE forecast at 47%

*Numbers are from SimplyWallSt.com*

This isn‚Äôt advice, please do your own DD.

Inb4 ‚ÄúOk Boomer‚Äù Still on the pokemon train

**TLDR**

¬∑ House always wins

¬∑ Dr Burry

¬∑ Asia most likely to be back to normal before the US

¬∑ Hotels, Casinos, Entertainment, Dining will continue to go off in Asia

¬∑ Online Casino‚Äôs partnership/acquisitions

¬∑ They are seeking growth and lots of it.

296,Harley-Davidson EARLY DD üöÄüöÄüöÄ,"Obligatory mentioning of GME @ 204 Average  **üöÄüöÄ**   


As a smooth brain ape myself of course I hold $GME, but since I am in it for the long run, (in it only for the dividends LOL  ü¶ç ) I am getting quite bored day to day, so I present to you a petrol-head fueled, newbie, smooth brain, stock-market-retarded, ape, **DD of Harley-Davidson**.  


OK so to begin with, let's address the elephant in the room - Why would a newbie piece of retard write a DD on $HOG *right now*. The answer is simple - **the Harley-Davidson Pan America**.

I hear you asking what sort of fruit it is this Pan American, well of course it is this one:

[Tendies Daddy $$$](https://preview.redd.it/qcjnnypejfk61.jpg?width=760&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1609aa27329c4b5aa5b416f1377143e0c4715663)

This fine beast right here is the brand spanking new Adventure motorbike by non-other than Harley Davidson Inc. Let me take a stab at selling it to you.

First let's look at the market segment (I have added average overall score as per my sentiment, so as not to bore fellow apes with particulates, after all this is the executive ape DD). The market segment gives a feel as to **how Harley sits against its competitors and more importantly what they expected Harley to do and what Harley actually did.**   


Adventure/Touring big engine bikes segment as of 2020:

* Yamaha Super Tenere - $16,999 (score about 7.5/10)
* BMW R1250GS - \~$22,000 (score about 8.5/10)
* Honda Africa Twin - \~$17,000 (score about 7.5/10)

So we've got our usual competitors with pretty nice bikes around the $20k mark. At the same time Harley-Davidson with its many faults from the last years has been counted by many as an extinct dinosaur. They have only been making the same stale old-school motorcycles that were **extremely overpriced and under-specced.** You can watch or read any of the 50 million videos and articles on the topic. (Heck, I even wrote an essay on it in when I was in business school) 

Imagine the look on everyone's face when news broke out that HD are making an adventure bike, which would push the brand into a fresh new direction. Everybody though that Harley-Davidson in typical HD fashion would come out with a **$30,000+ behemoth, that would be far less powerful and much heavier than the competition**.  


Several days ago the Pan-America was officially revealed at an entry price of **$17,230**!!! With all the bells and whistles and every option checked the price reaches a segment dominating $19,999!!!  


Now what of the bike itself then? Well it is **%30** **MORE** powerful than the above listed competitors and sits at a comfortable **second place in the entire segment** (only behind the KTM 1290 death machine). Reviewers are saying the bike **unmatched in its segment off-road** and no slouch on highways either.

Seeing this as a smooth-brained ape, I though to myself, well God Damn it, I should have bought $HOG when the price was low, before **they changed them selves from old dinosaur to daddy of the block.**  


Imagine my surprise when I open up the 5y graph and took a look at this one:

[Google stock, because I am ape in real life](https://preview.redd.it/ukw3g82bnfk61.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=be7f58c399a2cc136def3d9a3592adb00c7a7d05)

I believe Harley is making a huge comeback and I am betting down a proper chunk of my smooth brain portfolio.

297,A note on the possible ways shorts could worm their way out of this and one BIG problem we could face.,"To start off with, I have to say that this post is not intended to spread FUD or to discourage people. This is a post to help us ‚Äúplan for the worst and hope for the best‚Äù. It is to open a discussion with people more knowledgeable than myself who can help clear up some of these issues.

&#x200B;

While commenting on another post I started to realise some of the ways the hedge funds could try and climb out of this hole they have dug, or at least screw us over in the process of a squeeze. I have not seen these points being discussed nor do I know of any solid reasons why they couldn‚Äôt happen.

There is evidence that the shorts have already used illegal actions to supress the price and delay a full squeeze on GameStop. I cannot comment on whether they DEFINITELY committed any crimes, but in the interest of risk management I think we all need to presume they have done, and will do again.

You see, when an organisation has as much money as some of these hedge funds, they have power as well. Real power. Most people would presume the age of the 1% getting away with everything has passed, but it has just become more subtle. As the world saw in 2008, these people can and do get away with their crimes, even if it destroys entire economies.

Anyway, to get to the point, I have been thinking about multiple ways the shorts can and possibly will try and save themselves, or at least stop us from seeing the full potential of the squeeze.

\[Note: Some of these points are aimed directly at brokerages, but with the possibility that hedge funds may have pulled strings to manipulate the brokers in mind. i.e., Actions of brokerages that directly benefit the short sellers.\]

\[Note 2: This whole post is to be taken as a question of sorts. I am not stating facts, merely presenting problems. If anyone actually knows the definitive answer or likelihood to any of these problems then please comment.\]

&#x200B;

* **Brokerages block the ‚Äòsell‚Äô option.**

Considering our problem last time was them blocking buys, this might not immediately seem like such a bad thing, because that would mean the price would only go up, right?

Stopping further short selling would benefit us as the price couldn‚Äôt be supressed as much, but stopping us from selling would just mean the price would go up, and we‚Äôd be left watching as we are unable to ever sell. As much as I am willing to hold forever if I have to, we are all hoping for it to reach such a price where we would sell eventually.

But wouldn‚Äôt this be illegal? Would it? I thought that blocking buys would be illegal but apparently not. If they can block the buys they can probably block the sells as well ‚Äì they bury a lot of manipulative and controlling stuff in their terms and conditions. If anyone with a greater understanding of the law knows about the legality of restricting selling could let us know then that would be helpful.

&#x200B;

* **Brokerages allow people to sell at extreme profits, but refuse to pay the astronomical prices.**

This is one that definitely **should** be illegal, and something even the most untouchable couldn‚Äôt get away with. With that said, I don‚Äôt feel comfortable resting everything on a ‚Äòshould‚Äô. Whether you think it at all possible or not, imagine if the massive target of $30million per share actually happens. Can you really see all these brokerages just coughing up straight away without any fuss?

Or, is it at all possible that they could yet again hide behind legal loopholes and fine print to refrain from paying us those amounts? ‚ÄúThere is a maximum amount you can have in your account at one time‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis is over the maximum amount of money we can handle in a transaction‚Äù, ‚ÄúDue to the extreme volatility of this stock, sell order could not be processed, the number you are seeing on screen is incorrect and will be removed from your account. Do not try to withdraw any of this money.‚Äù The list goes on.

I especially want to make it clear here that I am asking if any of this is possible. I am a bit of an idiot but I think a discussion is worth having on these matters, because as far as I am concerned, everything is on the table and nothing is too farfetched.

&#x200B;

* **Brokerages artificially fake outages and failures, blocking people from using their services and pretending they were just overwhelmed with the extreme, sudden increase in volume of users again.**

How do we know they haven‚Äôt already done this? They can stop people from trading freely while blaming technology and even the large amount of people using their service.

&#x200B;

* **Hedge funds digitally attacking brokerages to cut off a large chunk of retail investors and lock them out of the squeeze.**

Is it possible the hedge funds could pay others to attack the brokerages digitally, whether through something like a DDoS attack or other methods? I imagine they would especially target the large no-commission brokers like Robinhood and T212.

It also seems to me like it would be a difficult crime to trace back to the hedge funds, and I actually see very little reason why hedge funds wouldn‚Äôt be able to do this. With the amount of money the hedgies are set to lose, they are going to be desperate and willing to resort to desperate measures. If this did happen and we were unable to sell then would we be entitled to compensation?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# THE BIG ONE.

**\[Update:** I have had numerous people commenting with good explanations of the following point. I am now considering 'THE BIG ONE' not so big anymore, and thank you all for your input.\]

If the main shorts responsible for all of this go bankrupt before they are able to buy back every single share they‚Äôd have to, what would happen then?

If the numbers people are estimating are even close to the true possible number then I would say it‚Äôs very likely they‚Äôd go bankrupt very quickly. It is my understanding that most debts of sorts are written off when a company or organisation files for bankruptcy, which is the main reason some people force their own companies into bankruptcy only the re-launch with a different name and no debt.

If we really do destroy the hedge funds that are behind the majority of the short positions, then do we destroy ourselves in the process? I can‚Äôt see them being forces to pay up billions upon billions in debt if they are bankrupt, because they would never reasonably obtain that money. In that case, who is going to pay?

My best guess is that in one the worst case scenarios the price skyrockets as they cover as much as they can and then it just stops when they run out of money. No one else is going to voluntarily buy those shares at those prices so wouldn‚Äôt we end up with GME stalling at an insane price but with no one able to sell and no one able to buy, meaning the share price would just‚Ä¶ stop?

If that did happen then I can‚Äôt see the SEC or the US Government (simply because it‚Äôs a US stock) doing nothing as for the first time a stock get‚Äôs infinitely stuck. Therefore, would they then artificially lower the price to get people buying again? This would mean none of us could actually sell at the price it reaches.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you even made it this far you are all probably pissed off at me for saying it over and over, but I am NOT claiming any of this will happen. The last thing I want to do is unintentionally spread FUD. I‚Äôm presuming some will call me a shill anyway for even bringing these points up but I need to clarify that I am invested in GME and I am confident that it will squeeze at some point. I am 100% in this cause, and I don‚Äôt believe this is any reason for people to worry or be demotivated.

With that said, I am not so na√Øve as to presume this will all go perfectly for us with no obstacles ‚Äì just look at last time when they stopped us from buying and killed the upwards momentum. We need to be as best prepared as we can, and ideally we need a legal ‚Äòmutually assured destruction‚Äô to dissuade anything I have mentioned here.

What I am asking for is for people to PLEASE prove me wrong. If any of you have a greater knowledge of the law or the inner workings of things then please comment and let us all know.

Beyond Meat and PepsiCo have announced the formation of a joint venture called The Planet Partnership to develop snacks and beverages made from plant-based protein. This is Beyond‚Äôs first expansion outside of plant-based meats, indicating that its total addressable market is likely larger than investors initially envisioned. The shares are responding accordingly, surging 20% on the news. If the venture is limited to the types of products already in Pepsi‚Äôs lineup, the Beyond Meat stock movement is likely an overreaction, as plant-based Frappuccino, Muscle Milk, and Matador jerky would likely not generate the $300 million in annual revenue needed to justify it. If the venture expands to other dairy and meat-based products outside of Pepsi‚Äôs current portfolio, the market opportunity will be larger, but so will execution risks as the firms move further away from their traditional areas of expertise. Additionally, while Pepsi has had several successful partnerships, not all its deals have panned out well.  The partnership with Pepsi is a wise approach to leveraging Beyond‚Äôs plant-based protein expertise and Pepsi‚Äôs marketing and distribution muscle in order to meet consumers‚Äô growing appetite for sustainable products. 





üöÄüöÄ  

Beyond Meat is a pioneer in the plant-based meat, or PBM, industry, offering the first burger to look and taste like meat, although it was soon followed by Impossible Foods and many others. Given the rapidly changing marketplace, it is too early to tell if Beyond‚Äôs first-mover advantage will result in a sustained market leadership position. A primary growth driver to be the 20% of consumers willing to adjust their habits to benefit the environment, as Beyond‚Äôs products emit 90% less greenhouse gases, require 93% less land, 99% less water, and 46% less energy to produce than their meat equivalents. PBMs will be very successful abroad, in China and India in particular, the world‚Äôs two most populated countries, each with 1.4 billion people. The products offer a great solution for China, which does not have enough arable land to feed its huge population, and a great fit for India‚Äôs large vegetarian population. Both countries are highly amenable to the products, with surveys showing 96% of Chinese and 94% of India‚Äôs population are likely to try the products, compared with 75% of U.S. consumers. The global PBM market will grow from $12 billion in 2019 to $74 billion by 2029 (a 19% CAGR), as PBMs grow from 2.5% of the ground meat market to 12%. Models show Beyond‚Äôs market share increasing from 2.5% in 2019 to nearly 9% in 2029, as PBMs gain a larger share of the overall meat category, and as Beyond‚Äôs brand continues to win with consumers, given its strong performance in taste tests and ongoing R&D investments.





üöÄüöÄüöÄ 

 There has been substantial consumer interest in Beyond Burger, which could signal modest initial brand strength, although the sustainability is far from a guarantee. The brand has been successfully used to drive traffic into restaurants. In the summer of 2018, A&W Canada, the country's second largest burger chain, ran an advertising campaign promoting the Beyond Burger, and the campaign drove a material increase in guest counts, leading to record same-store sales growth in the quarters following the launch, and the restaurant reported that it was the fastest new-product launch in the history of the chain. When Beyond Burger launched at TGI Fridays, it was also the fastest new product launch in the chain's history. Consumers flocked to KFC in Atlanta for a limited time test of Beyond Chicken, causing the store to sell out of the product in under five hours. That day the restaurant sold as many Beyond Chicken boneless wings and nuggets as it would normally sell of its popcorn chicken in a week. In April 2020, McDonald‚Äôs CEO stated the firm will launch a plant-based burger, but he was unsure of the timing. In November, the chain indicated the burger will likely not carry the Beyond brand, but we think Beyond will be a primary supplier, as Beyond helped to develop the product and few firms have enough capacity. The deal could add about $180 million in annual sales, increasing our valuation by 14% to $166.




üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
  
Beyond Meat is a pioneer in the plant-based meat (PBM) industry, launching the Beyond Burger, the first vegetarian burger designed to look and taste like meat, during the second quarter of 2016, shortly followed by privately held Impossible Foods' Impossible Burger, launched July 2016. While Beyond Meat is not the first PBM to hit the market, as wide-moat Kellogg's MorningStar Farms brand has been on the market since 1975, Beyond Burger revolutionized the category by targeting omnivores (95% of U.S. consumers) and first merchandised the products in the meat case in 2016. Also, unlike its predecessors, Beyond Meat seeks to make its products indistinguishable from their animal-protein equivalents in terms of appearance, taste, texture, and cookability. Legacy players (Kellogg's MorningStar Farms, Conagra's Gardein, Kraft-Heinz's Boca Burger) have sought to produce a vegetable- based product that tastes good, but does not mimic meat, which would not appeal to the products' largely vegetarian customer base. However, seeing the strong demand for meat-like PBMs from omnivores, several similar meat-like products, have launched over the past year. It took Beyond Meat seven years and Impossible Foods five years to develop a PBM that tastes, looks, and even bleeds like real meat. As the industry is in its infancy, and most competitive products are in the process of launching, it is too early to know if Beyond's first-mover advantage will prove prohibitive to overcome (similar to wide-moats Coke and Pepsi), or if the new products (most from well-resourced firms) will be able to quickly develop products that resonate with consumers. .




TLDR

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Plant-based meats (PBM) should continue to grow rapidly as the products gain additional share from the traditional ground meat category. Beyond Meat should be a major beneficiary of PBM growth, given its first-mover advantage, and the brand‚Äôs strong performance in taste tests. Beyond Meat will likely be a major PBM supplier for McDonald's, as it worked with the chain to develop its plant-based burger, and few competitors have enough capacity to supply the large restaurant. A deal could add $180 million in annual sales.

""The Company is not currently in the production stage and generally utilizes suppliers for outside development and engineering support.""

SOURCE: see 10K page 78 here: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000173128921000006/nkla-20201231.htm#i58a5fa00c30341b39fdb3dd97678d6e1_624

https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/nikola-corporation-nkla-q4-2020-earnings-call-tran/

In fact, 10k states it clearly:

""We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we begin significant deliveries of our trucks, which is not expected to begin at least until 2022 for our BEV truck and the second half of 2023 for our FCEV truck, and may occur later. Even if we are able to successfully develop and sell or lease our trucks, there can be no assurance that they will be commercially successful""

And here:

""We expect to derive revenue from our BEV trucks in late 2021 and FCEV trucks in the second half 2023. Prior to commercialization, we must complete modification or construction of required manufacturing facilities, purchase and integrate related equipment and software, and achieve several research and development milestones. As a result, we will require substantial additional capital to develop our products and services and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Until we can generate sufficient revenue from product sales and hydrogen FCEV leases, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of existing cash on hand, public offerings, private placements, debt financings, collaborations, and licensing arrangements.""

And here:

‚ÄúWe expect the rate at which we will incur losses to be significantly high in future periods as we:

‚Ä¢design, develop and manufacture our trucks;

‚Ä¢construct and equip our manufacturing plant to produce our trucks in Arizona;

‚Ä¢modify and equip the Iveco manufacturing plant in Germany to produce our trucks in Europe;

‚Ä¢build up inventories of parts and components for our trucks;

manufacture an available inventory of our trucks;

‚Ä¢develop and deploy our hydrogen fueling stations;

‚Ä¢expand our design, development, maintenance and repair capabilities;

‚Ä¢increase our sales and marketing activities and develop our distribution infrastructure; and

‚Ä¢increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations.

Because we will incur the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive any incremental revenue with respect thereto, our losses in future periods will be significant. In addition, we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in revenue, which would further increase our losses.""

Then there's is the pesky issue of multiple lawsuits and investigations hanging over Nikola:

‚ÄúOn September 10, 2020, Hindenburg Research LLC reported on certain aspects of the Company‚Äôs business and operations. The Company and its board of directors retained Kirkland & Ellis LLP to conduct an internal review in connection with the Hindenburg article (the ‚ÄúInternal Review‚Äù), and Kirkland & Ellis promptly contacted the Division of Enforcement of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to make it aware of the commencement of the Internal Review. The Company subsequently learned that the staff of the Division of Enforcement had previously opened an investigation. On September 14, 2020, the Company and¬†five¬†of its officers and employees, including Mark Russell, our Chief Executive Officer, received subpoenas from the Staff of the Division of Enforcement as a part of a fact-finding inquiry related to aspects of the Company‚Äôs business as well as certain matters described in the Hindenburg article. The Staff of the Division of Enforcement issued additional subpoenas to another¬†three¬†of the Company‚Äôs officers and employees, including Kim Brady, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, on September 21, 2020 and to the Company‚Äôs current and former directors on September 30, 2020.

The Company and Mr. Milton also received grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Southern District of New York (the ‚ÄúSDNY‚Äù) on September 19, 2020.
(...)
The Company also received a grand jury subpoena from the N.Y. County District Attorney‚Äôs Office on September 21, 2020. On October 16, 2020, the N.Y. County District Attorney‚Äôs Office agreed to defer its investigation; it has not withdrawn its subpoena issued to the Company, but has informed the Company that no further productions to it are necessary at this time.
(...)
The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the Staff of the Division of Enforcement and the SDNY investigations, nor can it predict whether any other governmental authorities will initiate separate investigations. The outcome of the Staff of the Division of Enforcement and the SDNY investigations and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include a wide variety of outcomes, including the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving the Company and/or current or former employees, officers and/or directors, the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and/or sanctions, modifications to business practices and compliance programs and/or referral to other governmental agencies for other appropriate actions. 
(...)
Further, to the extent that these investigations and any resulting third-party claims yield adverse results over time, such results could jeopardize the Company's operations and exhaust its cash reserves, and could cause stockholders to lose their entire investment.

Shareholder Securities Litigation

Beginning on September 15, 2020,¬†six¬†putative class action lawsuits were filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors, asserting violations of federal securities laws under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‚ÄúExchange Act‚Äù), and, in one case, violations of the Unfair Competition Law under California law (the ‚ÄúShareholder Securities Litigation‚Äù). The complaints generally allege that the Company and certain of its officers and directors made false and/or misleading statements in press releases and public filings regarding the Company's business plan and prospects.
(...) 
Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount in damages, attorneys‚Äô fees, and other relief. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself. The Company is unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these lawsuits, which could be material.

Derivative Litigation

Beginning on September 23, 2020,¬†two¬†purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (Byun v. Milton, et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-01277-UNA;¬†Salguocar v. Girsky et. al.,¬†Case No. 1:20-cv-01404-UNA), purportedly on behalf of the Company, against certain of the Company's current and former directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and gross mismanagement. The¬†Byun¬†action also brings claims for unjust enrichment and abuse of control, while the¬†Salguocar¬†action brings a claim for waste of corporate assets.
(...)
On December 18, 2020, a purported shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona,¬†Huhn v. Milton et al.,¬†Case No. 2:20-cv-02437-DWL, purportedly on behalf of the Company, against certain of the Company‚Äôs current and former directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, unjust enrichment, and against defendant Jeff Ubben, a member of the Company‚Äôs board of directors, insider selling and misappropriation of information.
(...)
The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages, costs and fees associated with bringing the actions, and reform of the Company's corporate governance, risk management and operating practices. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the foregoing complaints. The Company is unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these lawsuits, which could be material.""

The problem with all these investigations and lawsuits is that Nikola Motor has admitted that they have merit:

‚ÄúThe Hindenburg article alleged that Mr. Milton or the Company made a number of statements, which it asserted were inaccurate, including but not limited to the following:

1.in July 2016, the Company stated that it owned rights to natural gas wells, and in August 2016 that the wells were used as a backup to solar hydrogen production;

2.in August 2016, Milton and the Company stated that the Company had engineered a zero emissions truck;

3.in December 2016, Milton stated that the Nikola One was a fully functioning vehicle;

4.that an October 2017 video released by the Company gave the impression the Nikola One was driven;

5.in April 2019, Milton stated that solar panels on the roof of the Company‚Äôs headquarters produce approximately¬†18¬†megawatts of energy per day;

6.in December 2019 and July 2020, Milton stated that the Company ‚Äúcan produce‚Äù over¬†1,000¬†kg of hydrogen at the Company‚Äôs demo stations and that the Company was ‚Äúdown below‚Äù $3/kg at that time;

7.in July 2020, Milton stated that ‚Äúall major components are done in house‚Äù; he made similar statements in June 2020;

8.in July 2020, Milton stated that the inverter software was the most advanced in the world and that other OEMs had asked to use it; and

9.in July 2020, Milton stated that¬†five¬†trucks were ‚Äúcoming off the assembly line‚Äù in Ulm, Germany.

The statements listed above were inaccurate in whole or in part, when made.""

316,NVAX part II - Last call before a shit ton of catalysts,"[Link to pt I](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3ksw/nvax_dont_miss_this_perfect_vaccine_play_headed/)

TL;DR for Pt 1 is below:

1) NVAX has the best in class vaccine and has the technological advantage of being able to easily become multivalent. This means with 1 vaccine you can get immunity for multiple variants and even the Flu as well. Other companies, particularly MRNA companies, need to give you a separate vaccine for each dose. Also it can be stored at 4C long term (unlike MRNA which needs -20C to -70C long term) and it has less side effects and has the highest reported efficacy to date (95.6%).

2) NVAX is fundamentally undervalued. Sitting at a market cap of $15Bn it is cheap as shit rn. This company is expecting to produce 2 BILLION doses per year and has many deals established already with multiple countries for \~1.6 Bn doses this year alone. For reference, MRNA announced last week it expects a revenue of $18 Bn dollars in 2021. Guess how many doses they are planning to produce? 600 million. And they have a market cap of 62 Bn.

3) TONS of catalysts coming up.

\-Earnings call on Monday. If they give revenue estimates even half as good as MRNA they will pop to Pluto.

\-EU dose deal and approval. France and UK are already saying they're on the cusp of approval. Literally just waiting for finalization of UK phase 3 data which should come soon (this week? earnings call maybe as they did in the past for nanoFlu phase 3 results?). Approval will be their FIRST approved vaccine ever.

\-South Africa variant vaccine study. They already started developing their South Africa variant vaccine. More updates on this could send the stock up since it actually is for once not far behind MRNA and probably ahead of PFE for this.

\-NanoFlu. 9 months ago they revealed amazing phase 3 data for a new flu vaccine that is better than the current gold standard. They've been blue balling us saying they're almost ready to apply for an EUA since then. IDK when this will happen it seems they have their hands full with covid (maybe even a covid+flu vaccine?) but consider this one a slam dunk.

4) United States market share DOES NOT FUCKING MATTER. Everyone and their dog will say ""ah but they're too late. US already has enough doses for the whole population"". A) This is retarded the US will still buy NVAX doses. They will not be caught with their pants down and run out of vaccines in the future because they decided to be fully dependent on two companies with new vaccine modalities. B) This doesn't matter anyways, they have deals for 1Bn+ vaccines in the rest of the world (including many developed nations). PLUS they'll gobble up US market share eventually if they can get multivariant covid + flu vaccines going.

This company is severely undervalued. Short term price target of $500. This will come after EU approval and potential US EUA based on UK data (crossing my fingers for this). Long term price target of $1000+. 

WARNING this stock is not for paper handed bitches. Expect tons of volatility. However, it is in my opinion a clear slam dunk which has lots of short interest and might even end up in squeeze territory soon.

Positions: Missionary, $220c April 16th, eventually would like to roll out to July expirations. Honestly shares are prob a good way to go with this one. I've been getting my ass handed to me by holding this stock during this pullback but I'm not even scared and I bought even more. Anything under $300 for this stock is a steal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luuige/nvax_part_ii_last_call_before_a_shit_ton_of/,1614557034.0,45,45,0

\*\*$SENS\*\*

&#x200B;

Current Share price (2/28): $ 3.46

&#x200B;

\*\*THESIS:\*\*

Based on my DD I believe that SENS will be seen as substantially undervalued at its current market value in the near/mid future. With their 180-day sensor having been brought to market last quarter in Europe we should get impressive numbers out of them at earnings. This will establish to investors what the potential market for these kinds of devices will be. Due to the Diabetes epidemic in the United States the market for these sensors will be substantially higher than overseas. Once investors have the data from overseas sales they will extrapolate the potential earnings in the US and the fair value of the stock will rise dramatically. Over the next 2 years this type of technology will become industry standard for reading glucose levels as it saves users from constant finger pricks and will be able to supply doctors with substantially more data into a patient‚Äôs glucose levels. As the biopharma industry realizes this data can be used to analyze blood sugar levels in diabetics on a scale never seen before there will be a push from the biopharma industry to make these industry standard in order to accelerate the discoveries of new Diabetes treatments.

&#x200B;

\*\*ANALYSIS: ITM CALL BREAKDOWN\*\*

7/26 $1C

Current Premium = $2.55.

Delta = .9513 Gama =.0263 Theta = -.0014 Vega = .0021

&#x200B;

This premium is essentially the difference in cost of the current share price and the cost to exercise. Delta is high, Gama is low. This means for every $1 SENS increases the option will increase in value by $.95. Because Gama is low there is little room for the delta to grow past its current place. As the stock price grows deeper ITM Delta will increase slightly. If the stock price dips and becomes closer to the strike price Delta will decrease by the rate of Gama. Theta on this call is very low, it will take a long time before Theta rises to the point where Theta decay will become substantial. Vega is low, meaning implied volatility is considered low on this option. If the price of the stock were to begin to rise quickly Vega will rise as implied volatility increases.

&#x200B;

Takeaways from this information

&#x200B;

1. Delta and Gama are already priced into the Call, any growth you would see beyond a 1:1 ratio to the stock price will not come from the stock growing at its      current rate.
2. This is a safe call to hold for long term as the Theta is low.
3. Vega is not priced into the call. If the stock price were to begin to grow at a rate faster than it has historically Vega will begin to increase, accelerating the growth of the call.

&#x200B;

What are the potential benefits of buying this Call?

\-  If you believe the stock has room to continue growing at its current rate this call could be used to take a position in the stock at a discounted price. Instead of purchasing 100 shares for $346 you could buy this equivalent call for $255. If the stock price were to rise from here to $4.46 you would net a similar profit from purchasing the 100 shares or the call but would have needed less starting capital to do so.

\- If you believe that a catalyst is going to be coming sometime between now and EXPY this call would begin to grow in value beyond the rate of the stock price as Vega increases. This is because the higher Vega is not priced into the call at its current premium.

&#x200B;

What are the potential downsides of buying this call?

\- As the delta is already high any decrease in the share value will see a 1:1 ratio in the decrease in the Call‚Äôs premium. If the share price were to drop to $2.46 from its current price the Delta will decrease the Call‚Äôs premium to $1.55. This would be a 40% decrease in the calls value. This is a 10% larger loss of your starting capital than if you simply took the $255 you used for the premium of the call and used it to purchase it‚Äôs equivalent in shares.

\- Holding the call rather than shelling out the additional capital to purchase the shares means that you cannot hedge your position throughout its lifespan. If you are holding this call long term because you believe the stock is going to continue to grow at its current rate there will be unrealized gains that you could have made by selling Covered Calls along the way.

&#x200B;

Ways to utilize this Call to make a profit:

\- Because this Call has a low Theta it is safe to hold for a while as a stand in for 100 shares. This Call can be used to make gains short-term by purchasing now and selling when the stock hits your target price. By doing so you will earn the profits of 100 shares while having used less starting capital to do so. If Vega increases beyond what it is now than the change in volatility will help to supplement the profits that would have been earned on those same shares.

I would think this Call has more value potential than 100 shares if:

\- I believed that there is going to be a catalyst to disrupt its current rate of growth.

&#x200B;

A Possible Catalyst for $SENS Could Be:

\-  Earnings could show Impressive sales numbers from their European business, showing proof that there is demand and interest for their product. 

\- Their sensor being granted FDA approval within the time frame of the call. 

Either of these catalysts could trigger an increase in implied volatility (raising Vega).

&#x200B;

I run the risk of:

\-The stock falling on earnings below a threshold that other positive news could raise it above its current market value. This would result in a loss to my starting capital greater than if I purchased shares with the cost of the premium.

&#x200B;

Possible Scenarios:

&#x200B;

1. Earnings creates increased interest in the      stock. The price rises faster than it has been historically. Sell offs      occur as investors reach their exit price. The price begins to rise again      as other investors FOMO into the stock on the dip. As other catalysts form      this pattern (large amounts of new investors buying in as long-term      holders sell off) continues over a long enough period of time causing the      implied volatility of the stock to increase. The share price rises over      time on the waves.

\-The already high delta means it is good for a near 1:1 raise in Call value with stock price.

\- The increased Vega from the higher implied volatility also raises the cost of the premium.

\- The call becomes substantially more profitable than shares.

&#x200B;

2. Earnings has very little impact on interest of SENS. The share price grows gradually as its fair value increases.

\-The already high delta means it is good for a near 1:1 raise in Call value with stock price.

\-Vega remains unchanged

\- The calls profitability grows at a rate similar to that of the underlying shares.

&#x200B;

3. Earnings causes a massive shift in interest away from $SENS and the stock price sees a sharp drop followed by a continued bleed until it hits a price where it is viewed as undervalued. 

\- The high delta makes the call depreciate quickly

\- Vega will remain relatively unchanged.

\- The Call loses value quickly.

For this Call I think the most likely scenario is somewhere between 1 and 2. Whether it be earnings or FDA approval I think there will be continued rise in interest in SENS. 

&#x200B;

My Position (Entering Monday Morning):

200 Shares (Cost = $692) - I am going to hold these shares long term as SENS becomes more profitable. In the interim I am going to sell monthly covered calls on these 100% over whatever their current market value is to generate a small profit through premiums.

Example: The current price is $3.46 as of 2/28/21. I will sell 2 $7C 4/16 for a combined premium of $78. 

\-----------

10 X $1C 7/16 (Premium $2.50, Total Cost = $2550) - These will be the base of my position. Purchasing these over shares at current market value saves me $910 in capital. As I believe that SENS will come to be seen as undervalued at its current market price over the next 4 months I should see a profit at minimum equivalent to the shares they represent with the added upside of any increases due to an increase in Vega down the line.

\----------------

5 X $10C 1/20/2023 (Premium = $2.25, Total Cost = $1115) - These Calls are considerably attractive to me for two reasons. First ‚Äì I believe that $12 (The Break-Even Price) by the end of 2022 will be under market value for SENS. Second ‚Äì The Greeks present an opportunity to turn a profit short term should my thesis be altered. 

&#x200B;

The Greeks

Delta = .7902, Gama = .0340, Theta = -.0018, Vega = .0136

&#x200B;

For obvious reasons any Call planning to be held long term must have a very low Theta. Vega is priced higher than the 7/16 Calls I broke down, but I believe any drop in premium that could be caused by a decrease in Vega will be substantially offset by the Delta and Gama. A .7902 Delta for a Call that is over 100% OTM is substantial. Gama is high enough that the Delta will increase at a decent rate as the stock grows in price.

‚óè It is worth noting that a Delta this high on an OTM call means that the calls have plenty of room to drop if the share price falls below its current market price, increasing the risk of higher losses on this play.

&#x200B;

Exit Strategy:

\- Continue to hold shares and sell monthly covered calls 100% above market value until the rest of the play resolves. 

&#x200B;

\- If the value of my 7/16 Calls at any point becomes 200% higher than the value of the underlying shares I will trim 50% of this position. The other 50% will be held until July to be either sold or to be exercised. If these calls maintain a value similar the underlying shares I will hold until July and exercise at EXPY and begin to sell monthly covered calls 50% above market value until the rest of the play resolves or until assigned.

&#x200B;

\- I will hold the 1/20/23 Calls throughout all of 2021. If in 2022 profit levels reach +2000% sell 1. Sell another every time profit rises another 2000%. If profit never reaches target by June of 2022 adjust numbers to +1000%. If by October of 2022 profit targets have not been reached and share price is below $12 close position. If Share price remains above $12 hold until EOY and exercise Calls.

&#x200B;

After the Play

\- Continue to sell monthly covered calls of any accumulated shares at 20% above market value until assigned or until information comes up that would compel me to close out my position.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lurtpe/my_sens_play_breakdown/,1614549826.0,68,68,0

320,Why does $AXON have $0 debt on their B.S?,"I love AXON. I love the stock and I love the company. Sure, they‚Äôve been running a little hot lately, but so has the rest of the market and a slight correction seemed inevitable. They make awesome products, have done a fantastic job integrating a Recurring revenue stream and SaaS model into their product suite, and they‚Äôve seemingly cornered the market and are only just now beginning to expand their Intl footprint (from their 4Q20 call). 
The one thing Im left puzzled by is their lack of debt. On their 4Q20 call and supplemental material they highlighted ‚Äú$0 debt!‚Äù. Maybe an idiot or pure operator who knows nothing about finance would see that and celebrate it, but not only has the cost of debt been at all time lows, we know from M&M prop I & II that a company‚Äôs capital structure absolutely affects its value. 
It is smart for all companies to have debt, especially publicly traded companies unless they believe their stock is trading above fair market value in which case they‚Äôd sell stock to raise capital (which AXON did on the 4thQ), but in general this feels like a bad strategy and sends the wrong signal to the market. 
AXON‚Äôs cfo seems like a smart enough guy and none of the analyst on the call asked about this, so maybe there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing. 
Can anyone shed some light on why AXON is proud to have $0 in debt?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luz7p2/why_does_axon_have_0_debt_on_their_bs/,1614570565.0,19,19,0
321,Possible reason why SSR won't make a difference today?,"I have been watching premarket hours for a while because it's fascinating and I'm trying to learn as much as possible about how stocks work. I've been noticing something that was unexplainable to me at first:

[High Volume spike, no price change?](https://preview.redd.it/0ftyx0tp1fk61.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=004599711e1a88c53eb9b657613517ff2776b975)

Taking a look at the premarket above, there are spikes just like this that show a massive difference in volume, but the share price goes almost nowhere. I've already seen it this morning with another 200K spike in a single minute. This happens every morning pre-market, usually 2 or 3 times with a volume ranging from 100K to as much as a million shares from what I've seen.

[Premarket blip of almost 600K shares on Friday with no net change in stock price](https://preview.redd.it/v4r4j7z05fk61.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=1abef42e1bf67c6c6858df4db875cc8c64ae5b8b)

For this to be done by a single entity, there are only two scenarios I can think of that would make sense.

1. An entity is covering stock already owned with short positions they have. This is off the books, however, so I would think it wouldn't even show in the volume pre-market.
2. An entity is short selling the stock and then buying as many shares as were sold short.

Now why would someone do #2? (pun intended lol)Under SSR rules, you cannot short a stock during trading hours unless the stock is on an uptick. Today, GME is under SSR due to a -10% change from the open on Friday during the day. However, you may be allowed to short during pre-market hours at will (I'm too smooth-brained to know if that's true, but I can't explain that chart in any other way).

Furthermore, the number of ""available shorts"" on Fidelity has gone down from 446,000 to now 16,804 in premarket. Now you would think shorting almost 450,000 shares would impact the stock price pre-market if done without a counterbalance...

Now, the hedge fund has gone short on a stock and purchased shares in the same amount. Since there is no restriction on selling a share, the hedge fund is able to sell the share at will to have the same level of affect on the market as a short sale would.

I'd love to hear any other suggestions or ideas on what else could be happening, but this is the only conclusion I've ben able to come to so far.

EDIT:  
TLDR;  
Hedge funds may be shorting shares pre market and buying just as many shares, allowing the same impact a short sale would have throughout the day by selling the shares unrestricted

323,My $RIDE or die - Lordstown Motors,"  

I will start with my ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for this DD post ‚Äì I‚Äôm from Ohio. Born and raised. There has been a lot of pain for us Ohioans over the years. The weather here sucks, the Browns were complete GARBAGE for over 2 decades, and recently, a huge General Motors plant closed and cost our state thousands of jobs.

Enter Lordstown Motors and CEO Steve Burns who saw an opportunity to acquire the [3rd most productive automotive plant](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) in the country for pennies on the dollar and initially target fleet customers (a [very specific niche](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lordstown-motors-surpasses-100-000-124500104.html)) with [disruptive technology](https://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/best-2020-lordstown-motors-wheel-hub-motors/) in their vehicles.

**LM is just a start-up.. Is this another Nikola?**

No. This is very real, and yet Nikola‚Äôs market cap is somehow over 2x LM‚Äôs. [Recent confirmation](https://insideevs.com/news/490176/lordstown-motors-teases-beta-endurance-building/) by the CEO indicates that LM‚Äôs flagship Endurance truck is 97% ready, and will be [shown in action as a proof of concept](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-unveils-truck-for-race-in-mexican-desert/) in April. Production will begin this September ‚Äì the first ever electric pick-up truck to hit the road.

**How in the world will a company from small-town Ohio scale across the country?**

To help scale and increase a country-wide presence, [LM recently partnered with Camping World](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146315/0/en/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry.html). This partnership will allow LM to leverage over 170 Service and Collision Centers across the US, with thousands of technicians and service bays, a 24/7 tech hotline and Good Sam‚Äôs Roadside Assistance Program, Lordstown Motors customers are expected to enjoy one of the most comprehensive EV support systems ever designed.

This partnership might not seem like a big deal on the surface, but it‚Äôs basically giving LM an instant country-wide presence for its customers at a tiny fraction of the cost that it would take to build their own service centers. This is HUGE.

**Anything else besides a truck?**

Two other vehicles have been officially announced: an [electric van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) and an [electric RV](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34980821/lordstown-camping-world-electric-rv/) in partnership with Camping World.

**Areas for concern:**

This is pretty obvious. Some folks are skeptical because Lordstown Motors is a ‚Äústart-up‚Äù and will have to compete against larger companies. Analyst price targets range from as low as $18 to as high as $50.

But speaking of being skeptical, [I thought THIS TWEET from the Camping World CEO yesterday](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1365670229024645121?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) was interesting. He seems to be VERY confident in [what LM is doing](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx).

**My position:**

950 shares. The CEO Steve Burns is a very intelligent man, and I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute. Most people don‚Äôt know that 17 years ago, [he developed the technology patents that were eventually used for Apple‚Äôs Siri](https://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/article/steve-burns-wants-lordstown-motors-to-build-the-worlds-best-electric-pickup-truck/).

**Final comment:**

I made this post to increase awareness for a company that I think is flying under the radar to most investors. There is also a really high short interest right now as the whole EV market has sold off. I think all of the shorts are about to get squeezed.

324,SPY 410 by 3/31: A Smoothest Brain DD,"Somebody smarter than me correct my smooth brain DD here. 

US Equity Market is roughly 33 Trillion Dollars. US Bond Market in 2017 was around 44 Trillions USD (lets inflate that to 60 Trillion in 2021). 

The treasuries amount to roughly 40% of that, which is 24 Trillion. During last month's Treasury sell offs (and hence, increased rates) would have handed Bond Investors some 3.3 Trillion in cash on hand. 

Since, the story is hope of exploded pent up demand and faster than expected vaccinations, they will want to move the cash to equities for higher risk/returns. That means, 3.3 Trillion will start flowing to economy in some form. Given that S&P is 80% of US Equity (0.8\*33 = 26.4 Trillion), we can expect some 2.64 Trillion (0.8\*3.3) to flow into S&P making the valuation to be 33+2.64 = 35.64 Trillion. That's a 8% boost on S&P Index. 

TLDR: SPY Mooning by 8% by EOM. SPY 410 3/31.

328,Charles Schwab is hiding a giant ball of shit and won't come out and say what happened. How big is the ball of shit?,"Schwab had a bug on their platform that caused double selling and double buying in client cash accounts. Yes, it is a fucked up disaster. And yes, I'm already talking to lawyers so please none of the ""lawyer up"" shit, I know what I'm doing.

I'm just here to tell you the story.

This bug caused my 401(k) cash account to be out $180k. See my Sunday post last week if you want details: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a\_bug\_in\_schwab\_caused\_my\_retirement\_account\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/)

Forget about my account though. Look at the comments. This was me posting randomly on /r/stocks and without prompting for it, I got over 60 comments that said the same thing happened to them.

Let's figure this out with some (admittedly imprecise) napkin math:

* Suppose Schwab is \~5% of total stock market volume.
* U.S. Trading volume is maybe $1.250T (between Nasdaq + NYSE)
* Suppose the bug affects 5% of trades on Schwab. (This number has to be big enough account for the fact that so many comments appeared on my post)
* Suppose each illegal trade on average moves 10% before it gets resolved.
* Schwab is on the hook for any of these price movements that result in losses (half the price movements, because half were gains and some customers probably made out like bandits?)
* 1250000000000 \* 0.05 \* 0.05 \* 0.1 \* 0.5

**= $156m per day?** in what I'm referring to as ""a giant ball of shit""

Important points:

1. Schwab could be losing something on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars per day. Is the bug fixed? I have not seen any announcements about it. It's been over 30 days and I still haven't gotten a clear response from Schwab about my own personal issue.
2. This has been a problem for months, according to the comments. Read through the comments on my post in /r/stocks.
3. Schwab only has about $20B in total equity (according to Wikipedia, 2018)
4. I could have easily left GME naked short in my account. I don't know what Schwab would have done, or how many accounts have gone naked short, and stayed that way...

It still does not appear that the markets have priced this event in, yet. At best, Schwab lost some money. At worst, Schwab is actually bankrupt. I (currently) don't think it's very likely that they're bankrupt, but I do believe the markets are mispricing their stock.

**Schwab: If you don't want us speculating about how big this ball of shit is, then come out and say exactly how big it is. And tell us where the ""fix it"" money is coming from. Not client assets, I hope?**

Stay tuned for some more traditional DD in the coming days/weeks.

331,"The Yield Curve and You, A Primer","TLDR up front for the smooth brains: low fed rate make inflation, inflation make long term bond prices go ouchy, so short long term bonds as a hedge against inflation and collect your tendies.

Tldr;Tldr: Buy TMV

In depth for grown ups:

Low fed rate = borrowing money is easy/cheap = public companies boom = the stock market booms = long term treasury bonds must increase yield to remain a viable investment = long term treasury bonds must decrease price to increase yield= TMV 3x leveraged bear 20+ year treasury bond ETF will print until the fed rate is hiked back up.

So how does the yield curve fit into this? Basically it‚Äôs all about what the 10 year treasury yield is doing. If it‚Äôs much higher than the 2 year yield, then the curve is STEEPENING which means there is inflation risk. Which it‚Äôs starting to do now. 

Are we at risk for a market crash? Not really right now. Out of the past 13 major market crashes, the yield curve has been INVERTED for several weeks and this pattern has become one of the most important forward looking indicators of an impending crash. Right now it‚Äôs going in the opposite direction.

So, yield curve STEEP and UPHILL (right now)? Stocks are doing great but inflation is a problem. Keep buying your stocks but also short long term bonds for extra tendies. Throw some cash into commodities if you want to feel like a smart warren buffet boomer.

How about yield curve FLAT or DOWNHILL or INVERSED?

335,Moderna (MRNA) DD ‚Äì Why a 60B Company is Still Undervalued,"\*This will be my first DD post so let me know if you would like to hear about anything I didn‚Äôt touch on, or if you disagree on any particular points. Hopefully you find it useful!

**Overview**

This is going to be a long post, so I‚Äôm not going to waste your time by explaining who Moderna is. They‚Äôve been in the news for the last year and everyone and their mother knows what they‚Äôve accomplished. They (along with Pfizer/BioNTech) are the big dogs when it comes to COVID-19 vaccination in the U.S., and their dominance in the market will likely continue.

But Moderna isn‚Äôt just a COVID-19 vaccine company, as their CEO repeatedly stressed in their most recent earnings call. Moderna is a true pharmaceutical giant in the making. They are currently developing 24 different products ranging from viral vaccines, to treatments for autoimmune disease, to cancer and heart disease therapeutics.^(1) The vast majority of these modalities are using mRNA technology to attempt to accomplish the desired effect. Not so coincidentally sharing the same name as Moderna‚Äôs ticker, mRNA technology is a relatively new modality that is just beginning to take hold as a game-changer in the biotech/pharma space. Let‚Äôs talk a little more about it so we can understand why it has the potential to create a major-shake up in the pharmaceutical industry.

**History of mRNA Technology**

mRNA was discovered in the 60‚Äôs in mice, but it wasn‚Äôt seriously considered for a possible therapeutic target until the 90‚Äôs. Various studies in vitro and in mice since this period have been done, demonstrating potential for the treatment of HIV, cancer, degenerative disease, autoimmune disease‚Ä¶ I could go on. As we know, pharmaceuticals move slowly, and serious development of these products didn‚Äôt really take off until the 2010‚Äôs.^(2)

Prior to December 2020, there were only two medications utilizing mRNA technology that have received FDA approval. Inotersan and Patisiran were both developed and FDA approved in 2018 to treat a rare hereditary condition called hATTR which involves pathologic deposition of amyloid into the tissues of those affected. Without going into too much detail, this condition has a mean survival time of 15 years after diagnosis and leads to significant patient morbidity and suffering in the interim. Inotersan is the more successful of the two drugs and looks to be potentially curative for some patients with a disease which used to be a death sentence. Routine imaging since the phase III trials for Inotersan shows little to no progression of the disease in most patients, laying out the possibility that these patients may live a normal life moving forward.^(3)

With two more successful examples of mRNA technology being used in the COVID-19 vaccines, I expect that interest in the technology will skyrocket and subsequently so will funding and development.

**First Mover‚Äôs Advantage**

This will be a short section; Moderna is THE biggest player in developing mRNA therapeutics. There are other companies like BioNTech, CureVac, Gradalis, and Ionis, and of these only BioNTech (BNTX) can compete in sheer breadth of product development as well as having a history of success. For the sake of time I won‚Äôt address the other companies, but a key advantage that Moderna has over BioNTech is that they have moved more quickly through their clinical trials than BNTX has. Outside of COVID-19, Moderna currently has 4 products in Phase II trials (with their CMV vaccine moving to Phase III very soon), while BNTX only has 1.^(4) Long term I believe both of these companies will be highly successful, but Moderna is a more mature company that will be seeing the fruits of their labors more quickly than their competitor(s).

**The Future of COVID-19 Vaccination, and Vaccination in General**

Moderna currently has about 60% market share, distributing 40M of the 70M total doses the U.S. has received. I expect that number to drop slightly, but I would expect that Moderna ends up vaccinating approximately 40% of all Americans when it‚Äôs all said and done, with Pfizer vaccinating a large chunk of the rest. After that, Moderna will likely shift distribution to other countries and deliver on their agreements abroad.

‚ÄúBut what about NovaVax, J&J, and AstraZenica?‚Äù you might ask.

Without undercutting these companies and their potential, they are simply too late to the game in the U.S. to grab meaningful market share from Moderna and Pfizer.^(5,6) Johnson and Johnson was just recommended for authorization yesterday (2/26/2021) and will likely begin distribution in the coming weeks, however they are only expected to deliver 100M vaccines by the end of June. Moderna will deliver 300M by July^(7), on top of the approximately 40M they have already delivered. The U.S. has agreed to purchase more than 1.2B doses of the vaccine from a number of companies, but much of that will go overseas after American citizens have received their 2 doses.

Moderna is establishing relationships and trust globally with the successful development and distribution of their COVID-19 vaccine, but why is this important? Let‚Äôs think back to what the CEO said in their recent earnings call ‚Äì Moderna is NOT a COVID-19 company. Digging into their therapeutics pipeline, we can see mRNA candidates targeting Influenza, Cytomegalovirus, Nipah Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Epstein-Barr, Zika, Chikungunya‚Ä¶ Relationships established during this pandemic will serve them well in the development and distribution of future vaccine candidates like those listed above.

WAIT there‚Äôs more: back in January, Moderna announced plans to create a combination Influenza/COVID-19 vaccine, with the possibility of adding more candidates to the mix if they were to receive approval. With the number of viruses that they are targeting, Moderna has the potential to become the leader in vaccination globally, period. Their ability to create combination vaccines targeting a host of common viruses could be the new standard in vaccination. Certain candidates like RSV, CMV, and EBV are likely to become standard vaccinations given in childhood like other vaccines we are familiar with such as MMR and Varicella.

The potential of this company in the vaccination industry is endless, and right now they are just scratching the surface.

**Future Revenue Projections ‚Äì $18 Billion --> ???**

During their most recent earnings call, Moderna reported that they have orders for their vaccine totaling $18 billion^(8), and they are expecting more orders throughout the year. The COVID vaccine market is likely to cool off a little after that, but experts currently predict that COVID-19 boosters will become a routine part of care in the future, likely needing a new dose every 2-3 years.^(9) Now this would likely represent a major hit to revenue if Moderna was just a COVID-19 vaccine company but once again, they are not.

Lets briefly talk about a virus you may have never heard of before ‚Äì cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is something you‚Äôve likely had in the past and didn‚Äôt know it, so why is it a problem? Oddly enough, this seemingly benign little virus causes about 25,000 birth defects per year in the U.S. Globally, it is estimated that 1 in 1000 babies will be born with a birth defect due to CMV.

Currently there is no vaccine, but do you know who has the most promising candidate that is already enrolling participants for phase III trials? You guessed it ‚Äì Moderna. The addressable market for this vaccine is conservatively estimated at $2-5 billion/year.^(10) I expect that if it is approved by the FDA that it will likely see global adoption and that revenue number is likely to be much higher.

Repeat the above for RSV, EBV, Zika, etc. and it is not hard to envision a company that is bringing in $30-50 billion a year in annual vaccination income alone. If they were to succeed in any of their more lofty quests to develop an HIV vaccine, or therapeutics for autoimmune hepatitis, or personalized cancer vaccines‚Ä¶ the sky is the limit.

**Justifying Current Valuation, and Then Some**

Moderna‚Äôs current market cap is 62.16B. Their orders for 2021 currently exceed $18B with room to grow. The average revenue multiple for a biotech company is between 6-8x, and Moderna is trading at less than 4x. If you consider Moderna a pharmaceutical company, than the average multiple would be about 5x, still under.^(11)

I know we are looking at unrealized revenue with Moderna at this point, as that $18B will be earned throughout the year, so I understand that technically speaking they are still trading at an obscene P/S ratio compared to other more mature companies. However, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that demand for their product isn‚Äôt going away anytime this year and they have proven that they are able to execute and even exceed expectations when it comes to manufacturing and distributing their product.

Looking at their most recent earnings report for Q420 which was released on 2/25/21, their balance sheet is stellar. They are holding around $3B in cash from recent deposits, and they have almost no debt to speak of.

Simply put, they are undervalued at their current price. Without even factoring in the potential of everything else in their pipeline, they should be worth more as just a COVID-19 company with stellar financials and a relatively palatable multiple going into the later part of this year.

My personal price target: $220/share. With 396M outstanding shares, a $220 share price would place Moderna at $87B, which I believe to be a fair valuation through this year. This would represent a 4.8x multiple to their projected revenue in 2021. This represents a 41% increase in price from where Moderna is trading at currently which is \~$155/share.

**Closing**

Understand that this company has enormous potential for growth, but also potential to fail. Most pharmaceutical products fail in clinical trials before ever reaching market, and the same could be true for most if not all of Moderna‚Äôs pipeline. I personally believe that mRNA products have a higher chance of success than traditional therapeutics, but I‚Äôm not going to go into my reasoning for that in this post.

Every trade carries risk, and the risk with buying Moderna is that the market for COVID-19 vaccines shrinks as the world gradually develops herd immunity, the rest of their products fail in clinical trials, and they die a slow death without ever bringing another product to market. Nonetheless, I am confident and hopeful that this will not happen, and Moderna will become the next company to join the ranks of Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, and company as a true juggernaut of the biotech/pharma sector.

337,Snack on the Sneakiest Short Squeeze of all time with UTZüöÄüöÄüöÄ,"I know what you‚Äôre thinking. A potato chip company, you gotta be kidding me. I also know you‚Äôre thinking another fucking short squeeze, but hear me out‚Ä¶ There is something VERY strange going on with this stock and I‚Äôm here to shed some light on it. 

Well listen here smooth brain because I‚Äôm not kidding and I would never fucking touch a company that moves as slowly as this stock unless I thought I could make a shitload of money. 

There is the sneakiest short squeeze of all time going on here and I‚Äôm ready to exploit it and apparently somebody else is too. 

So here it is, laid out as simply as I can put for you dumbasses. Somebody (insider, smart-money, whoever) who knows something we don‚Äôt know is betting BIG that this stock is hitting 30$ by the March 19th expiration. They have **OVER 600,000$ riding on this call that sits 5$ out of the money**\- it's the absolute definition of unusual options activity and when coupled with the fact the stock rarely has any options volume and it has ZERO upcoming public events something is about to happen and we just don‚Äôt know it yet. 

[Unusual Option Activity on 2\/17 for March 30c](https://preview.redd.it/b95j2t6bubk61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=35b88b935343a21aac7fb5f6d57e75ac2dffbc24)

My thoughts are pretty simple- this stock is on its way up to the fucking moon and with contracts this cheap now after a market slump the opportunity to **10X or 15X** your invest is there. Somebody knows something is going on and with UTZ ‚Äòs recent history of buying up other brands On the Border Tortilla Chips (Second leading tortilla chip brand) and Vitner‚Äôs (A Chicago based salty snack manufacturer) a merger is most likely on the horizon and undoubtedly sending this stock over 30$. This merger or announcement would send the shorts running and in an attempt to cover they‚Äôd find themselves buying back the stock at insane amounts. 

If you made it this far I bet you already are considering it so why waste your time anymore.

**TLDR: Buy March 19th 30C wait for a big random catalyst event and enjoy.**

For a deeper analysis of what I think will happen here it is:

**The most likely scenario: UTZ 32$+ Per Share 500% Return**

Unlike most of the other companies looked at on this forum UTZ actually makes money. It IPO‚Äôd via a SPAC merger and has been on a tear up over 150% since then. However, unlike your typical SPAC this company makes good money and has a good balance sheet with plenty of cash on hand. They‚Äôve been using this cash to buy other brands like crazy in hopes of expanding their market out of the mostly the northeast and midwest to the rest of the country. Their CEO Dylan Lissette has made it known on CNBC that he wants to grow the company and has aggressive plans to do so. This would lend that big better to most likely be anticipating a massive merger in the following weeks which would allow them to cash in their huge position at a massive gain. 

**The rare but plausible scenario: UTZ Short Squeeze 50$+ Per Share 5000% Return**

This will sound a little crazy but at this point I know you guys will believe anything if I put enough rockets and tell you I‚Äôll make you rich- which I am. So listen, **THIS WILL MAKE YOU RICH IF IT HAPPENS AND IT'S WORTH BETTING ON**. There is the possibility for a quick short squeeze and a subsequent gamma squeeze the likes of which would send this **WELL** stock beyond 50$. 

Here is some quick math for you:

15.23% of the stock is held by insiders.

71.26% of the stock is held by institutions. 

There are 2.95 MILLION shares SHORTED.

What this all means is that with the current amount of stock held by insiders and institutions there is only 8 millions shares free float. This becomes a big problem for the shorts very quickly if the stock price shoots up on a merger, not only because they are forced to buy back their shares BUT market makers are now involved due to the larger options orders THAT if soon become in the money will FORCE them to buy shares of the underlying stock to remain delta neutral.

As you know market makers try their best to remain delta neutral when making deals. When this big buyer came in and forced market makers to open 5,000 contracts with a delta of 0.25 they were forced to buy 25% of the shares they owed in those 5,000 contracts- to remain delta neutral as I said. 

5,000 contracts = 500,000 outstanding shares (if the contracts are in the money) 

In order to remain delta neutral they would have to purchase 125,000 shares. Which they did as seen here: When the big buy orders hit the tape at 10:11 AM we see a huge spike as market makers buy in as they need to have 125,000 shares purchased to remain delta neutral. 

[MM Big Purchase at 10:11 on 2\/17](https://preview.redd.it/gso9r544vbk61.jpg?width=1177&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cff362d577d8fe165cfc3728b8bac6b5e7cef50)

As open interest increases and we now see it nearing closer to 7,000 contracts, as the stock moves closer to 30$ more market makers will be forced to buy in and thus leave less room for the shorts to cover their asses. If buying increases and stock is held then these shorts could be on the hook for a lot of money.

Perfect way to hedge against market crash is what I read, plus it's the sauce on top of GME causing market wide volatility.
Why would I not like my GME tendies with VIX sauce? 

My order for monday: 
-VIX 80 Call 17MAR21 @ $0,20
-VIX 110 Call 17MAR21 @ $0,05
wil update with positions once order has gone through.

By the way, I noticed how the same VIX calls are like 4x as expensive in April compared to March. Is this possible hedging by funds for the disaster to come? 
Are there any reasons to believe that the market goes nuts especially in April compared to march? 
I know that DFV's GME calls expire in April; would they be expecting the distaster to come by then? 

Wil a geomagnetic reversal happen in which Earth's magnetic poles switch, causing our Earth to not be shielded from solar flares and high velocity charged particles (would probably cause some nice volatility)

339,Is the TESLA #TSLA Hype over or we are heading to new Highs soon?,"Last week was a good week for all the Tesla sceptics who are waiting for the so-called ""Hype"" to be over and the price to drop. But are they right? Let's look at some of the macro and micro trends and let's see where the share price could be possibly heading.

**1. Macro:**

* In the US, Biden has made it clear that the EV boom is just getting started. This means, that those who are already ahead of the curve are in a very strong position.
* He made it clear that we are going to see a major shift, stating he plans to replace the entire government vehicle fleet with electric vehicles.
* That includes 245,000 in various federal agencies‚Ä¶ 225,000 in the United States Postal Service‚Ä¶ and another 173,000 in the military.
* That adds up to a grand total of 643,000 cars, trucks, and vans set for an upgrade on the U.S. government‚Äôs dime.¬†
* Also across the world, more countries are following or have already started.
* For example, Norway imposed several changes in the government years ago just like the United States, and it‚Äôs led to a sweeping transformation.¬†
* In fact, 54% of all vehicles sold in the country last year were electric vehicles.

**2. Micro:**

* Tesla's forecast in terms of deliveries is looking very promising.
* Deliveries are expected to rise from about 500,000 last year to 894,000 this year and 5 million by 2024. By 2030, annual deliveries could climb to about 9 million.
* This is mainly due to increased efficiencies in the production and new productions plants being built in China, Germany and Texas
* Some analysts also expect that Tesla could be generating 37bn free cash flow by 2025; just as a comparison Facebook is currently generation 23bn.

To summarise: Before any sceptics get too happy, Tesla is still a very much hold for us and some well-known analysts even anticipate the **price to head towards $1200 next year**.

346,The toothpaste theory: a case for GME,"I was scrolling through our hometown and stumbled upon the ""what are your moves for tomorrow""-thread. As I was picking my nose, touching myself, and scrolling (I use my right foot), I came across my screen and also a comment made by u/gt-70. It was something along the line of:

""If I hold this hard it will squeeze.""

Instantly, my Tony Stark-Hawking-Hawk-Bruce-Banner-Dr. Phil senses started tingling and I rushed to my lab. I threw aside the Japanese silicone fuck doll I just bought with my stimulus check and started sketching. This is what I came up with.

THE TOOTHPASTE THEORY

When you brush your teeth (lol who even does that), you use toothpaste. Toothpaste comes in a tube. When it's a recently opened one, only by holding the tube softly, the paste squirts out softly, gently, and fluidly. Easy, right? However, the more you use it, the harder it is to get the white, soft, fresh, creamy substance out. You literally have to hold it ridiculously tight and push, hard, harder, until it squeezes its last drops of goo right over your stick you put in your mouth.

This is exactly the same with GME. The longer you're in it, the less you get out of it. In order to get more out of it, you have to apply more force for it to result in more cash money. 

The next time you think about a short squeeze, holding, and/or masturbatating, just remember:

So then there's r/wallstreetbets, and that's the disconnect I have. The WSB effort as I understand it was to increase and maintain an overvalue of GME (and others) in order to screw hedge funds holding short bets. (Nice!)

If you do not know, this ""gamma squeeze"" occurs because of call options. As the prices surges, Market Makers are forced to write more calls and buy shares before they even become available, surging the price higher. 

So, now because we have fallen all the way back down to $40, we have a catapult cocked down as far as it can go, ready to be launched.

There are *millions, and millions, and* ***millions*** of shares written in those call options all the fucking way up to 800. These shares are not only buried in the 2/26 calls, but also every single date after this as well. ***So many fucking shares.***

If we can get to 800 and *all these calls become* ***in the money*** the Market Makers will have to scramble to buy millions and millions of shares that will surge the price up.

The craziest part is that this does not even take into account the shorts covering. So, as the Mother of All Gamma Squeezes squozes, sending the price into the thousands, the shorts will then also be skyrocketing the price at infinitely higher prices.

If you did not read my last dd [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnvvu3/why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a_collapse_of_the/) about GME short interest being 400%, we learned that u/thabat ran an AI-generated model of GME‚Äôs stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme ***$130k a share.*** 

Now, while I then believed this to be a completely outlandish number, I now believe to have realized that this gamma squeeze that will occur if we hit 800, ***is what it predicted.*** 

*To reiterate:*

*I believe that the AI-Model of GameStop's share price, which predicts $130k a share, is predicting this because it believes that we will hit 800 before 2/26, therefore causing the* ***M****other* ***o****f* ***A****ll* ***G****amma* ***S****queezes. Which will* ***then*** *trigger the infinity short squeeze which sends us to $100k+.* 

Many others are also starting to realize this as well, check out this post on r/stocks

While this is not financial advice, it is in my opinion that we need to do our best in holding and buying in order to get the stock price above $800 before Friday. This AI believes we fucking did it, lets prove the future right.
