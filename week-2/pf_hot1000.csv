Last March, we posted a [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fhrfqo/coronavirus_megathread_resources_discussion_and/) with tons of information about Coronavirus-related issues, and in September a [second megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) was posted with additional information on updates to payroll tax deferrals, student loan interest waiver, and unemployment. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic and recent U.S. governmental actions, we are posting a third installment of this megathread. **Please keep in mind that politics and political discussions are still not allowed here.**

# Stimulus Payments (updated Feb 13, 2021)

If you have not received the first or second stimulus payments at this point and believe you are eligible, or are eligible for more than you have already received based on your 2020 tax return, you will have to file your 2020 tax return and claim the missing amount as the [Recovery Rebate Credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit). Common cases where this applies:

*I believe I was eligible for the first and second stimulus but haven't received it, and still get an error when checking the Get My Payment portal

* I was a dependent in 2019 (and/or 2018 if your 2019 was not yet filed for the first stimulus), or mistakenly indicated that I could be claimed as a dependent, but cannot be claimed as a dependent for 2020 (Note: You don't just decide if you're a dependent or not, verify if you are eligible to be claimed as one [as defined by the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p501#en_US_2019_publink1000196863).)

* I had a child in 2020 and am now eligible for the additional amount for a qualifying dependent

You can check if you are eligible with the [IRS eligibility FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-a-eip-eligibility). Non-dependent individuals were eligible for $1200 for the first stimulus and $600 for the second stimulus if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) was below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 for the first stimulus and $1,200 for the second stimulus if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 for the first stimulus and $600 for the second stimulus per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

If your AGI is above the cutoff amounts noted above, your stimulus payment will be reduced by 5% of the difference between your AGI and the income threshold. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000 for the first stimulus and $87,000 for the second stimulus. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000 for the first stimulus and $174,000 for the second stimulus.

**The recovery rebate credit is determined based on the information on your 2020 tax return**, you can see the amount you’re being credited directly on your Form 1040, Line 30 of your prepared return before you file. Any of the online tax services can handle this tax credit. If you have questions about which tax software to use, there is a [Tax Filing Software Megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/kz613i/tax_filing_software_megathread_a_comprehensive/) with more information.

Some people have reported getting the second stimulus payment later than expected, so it’s recommended to double check the status of your stimulus payments on the [Get My Payment portal](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) before filing your tax return. 

### **FAQs:**

* **Q** I filed my 2020 tax return already to claim the second stimulus payment I hadn’t yet received, then received a check in the mail for the missing amount. What do I do?

* **A**  You'll likely have to wait until your return is processed, and then file an amended return, to correct this issue.

* **Q** I don’t file tax returns because I earn below the reporting threshold or don’t have any income. How do I get the recovery rebate credit?

* **A**  You can file a tax return without income. Include any income you do have, even if it is below the reporting threshold, even income from a savings account can be included. Otherwise you may need to add in $1 in interest income in order for the online tax services to be able to handle processing the return. This is essentially what the Non-Filer’s Tool that was open last year did for you.

* **Q** I am eligible for both the first and second and stimulus based on my 2018 and/or 2019 tax return, but will not be eligible based on my 2020 tax return. If I never received it, is there anything I can do to get the recovery rebate credit?

* **A** No, the recovery rebate credit is ultimately a 2020 tax credit. The information provided on your 2020 tax return is what is being used to determine your eligibility, your previous return information does not matter at this point.

* **Q** I am eligible for both the first and second and stimulus based on my 2018 and/or 2019 tax return, but will not be eligible based on my 2020 tax return. Will I need to pay back what I received?

* **A** No, there was no information provided in the bills requiring payments to be returned if eligibility changes between the 2018/2019 and 2020 tax years. This is also noted in the [IRS FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-j-reconciling-on-your-2020-tax-return).

* **Q** The [Get My Payment](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) portal says the payment was already sent and/or I received Notice 1444 in the mail saying my stimulus was sent, however I never actually received it. What do I do?

* **A** See the IRS page on [Payment Issued but Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Not Received](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-f-payment-issued-but-lost-stolen-destroyed-or-not-received) for guidance on starting a Payment Trace

The IRS has an extensive list of [Economic Impact Payment FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center) with more information.

Be aware of potential scams related to stimulus payments or other coronavirus relief packages. CNBC has a helpful article with examples of [common stimulus scams](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/29/stimulus-check-scams-here-are-red-flags-to-watch-for.html).

At this time, [a third stimulus has been proposed](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602024/second-stimulus-check-update-senate-kills-2000-payments), but has not been officially passed. If that changes we will update this information to reflect that. **Until then, there is no additional information to provide regarding the criteria for a potential third stimulus or how the payments may or may not be handled.**

# Payroll Tax Deferral

Payroll taxes consist of two related taxes: Social Security (6.2% of wages) and Medicare (1.45% of wages). Both employees and employers pay these taxes (i.e., for every $1 of social security taxes you pay, your employer also pays $1). Only the Social Security portion of payroll taxes may be deferred right now, not Medicare.

The Secretary of the Treasury has been [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/) to defer the collection of Social Security taxes on those making a gross income of less than $104,000 / year ($4,000 or less per bi-weekly paycheck) starting September 1.

Implementing seems to be optional by employers and many employers have decided to not implement this.

The IRS had issued Notice 2020-65 indicating that taxes deferred must be withheld and paid between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021, or interest and penalties will start accruing on May 1, 2021. **The window to payback the deferred taxes has been extended under the new stimulus bill to December 31, 2021. Deferred taxes must be paid by January 1, 2022 or interest and penalties will start accruing.** 

See the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for FAQs regarding the payroll tax deferral 

# Coronavirus-Related Distributions from Retirement Plans

Penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts for Coronavirus-Related Distributions ended December 30, 2020. If you made one of these withdrawals during 2020, remember that you have three years to pay the income taxes on the withdrawal. The IRS has an article with [Coronavirus-related relief for retirement plans and IRAs questions and answers](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/coronavirus-related-relief-for-retirement-plans-and-iras-questions-and-answers) with more information.

# Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Rollover

FSA account balances typically do not rollover year-to-year. The second stimulus package allows for FSA balances at the end of 2020 to be rolled over and used in 2021. Any FSA balance remaining at the end of 2021 may also be rolled over and used in 2022.

# Unemployment Benefits

Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) provides benefits to individuals typically not eligible for unemployment insurance, such as independent contractors or gig workers. Under the CARES Act these benefits were set to expire Dec 31, 2020. It has now been extended to March 14, 2021. Please visit your state’s PUA website for more information.

The previous unemployment relief of $300/week from the federal government and $100/week from the state expires Dec 26, 2020 (see the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for more information and FAQs regarding [this executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/) from August). **Under this new bill, federal unemployment will provide an additional $300/week through March 14, 2021, and the maximum number of weeks that unemployment can be claimed has been increased from 39 weeks to 50 weeks.**

**If you lost your job or are at risk of losing your job:**

Please read the information available in the [Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)

If you have any questions regarding those resources, feel free to ask here, but please be as specific as possible with your current situation and what steps you have taken so far.

# Student Loan Interest and Payment Waiver (updated Feb 13, 2021)

The CARES Act suspended federally-held student loan payments and interest charges until September 30, 2020. The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/) signed in August extended this to December 31, 2020. The December bill extended this date to January 31, 2021. At the [end of January](https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/f), the deferment was extended until Sept 30, 2021. 

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

Read https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/ for more information and updates.

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Most mortgage owners eligible for reduced or suspended payments for up to 12 months under the CARES Act 

Key points:

1. The CARES Act covers about [70% of all mortgages](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=406472) in the U.S. (those backed by Fannie and Freddie, FHA, VA, or USDA). Many companies have similar policies for most other types of loans. If you aren't sure what kind of loan you have, ask your servicer.

2. In most cases, you will [not owe the missed payments as lump sum](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/after-you-receive-relief/#repay). There was a lot of confusion about this. The new guidance says that lump sums are not required for [GSE](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Announces-Payment-Deferral-as-New-Repayment-Option-for-Homeowners-in-COVID-19-Forbearance-Plans.aspx) and [federal loans](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/SFH/documents/IACOVID19FBFactSheetConsumer.pdf).

3. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

4. Requesting mortgage relief/deferral will appear on your credit reports and may affect your eligibility for refinancing (but doesn't affect your actual credit score).

5. For more info, the CFPB published [step-by-step information](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/housing) about how to request payment relief.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs. 

Effective Dec 1, 2020, refinancing mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will incur a 0.5% [adverse mortgage fee](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/refinancing-a-mortgage-will-cost-more-thanks-to-an-adverse-market-fee.html). 

# Relief for Renters (updated Feb 13, 2021)

The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/) signed in August required certain federal agencies to take steps to limit foreclosures or evictions. It did not include a list of specific actions or policies. 

Following this in September, the CDC ordered [Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions To Prevent the Further Spread of COVID-19](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/04/2020-19654/temporary-halt-in-residential-evictions-to-prevent-the-further-spread-of-covid-19) that expires December 31, 2020. This has since been extended to March 31, 2021.

Read [Protection for Renters](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/) from the CFPB and visit the [NLIHC page for COVID-19 Rental Assistance programs](https://nlihc.org/rental-assistance) for additional information and resources

2,"Personal finance tips you may not know, including tax hints","A lot of personal finance advice is straightforward applications of math: Keep expenses less than income.  Pay off highest interest rate debts first.  Compound growth is your friend.

Then there are legal requirements and benefits:   Use tax-preferred retirement / HSA accounts.  Keep insurance in force.   Know how self-employment taxes work. 

This post is about less-obvious ways to use existing US laws to your advantage.   (Our friends in other countries are welcome to lobby for local versions *in their associated personal finance subs*.)

Provisions you may not know, though your tax software should be able to help with these if you tell them you qualify:

Taxes / tax planning:

- Take advantage of ""[adjustments](https://smartasset.com/taxes/tax-breaks-you-can-claim-without-itemizing)"" like IRA/HSA contributions,  student loan interest,  self-employment taxes/health insurance paid, etc., to reduce taxable income if you are eligible.  You can take these even if you do not   itemize.   There is a special $300 charitable contribution adjustment for non-itemizers for the 2020 tax year. 

- If you are not a full-time student and earn less than 33K single / 66k jointly, you can use the [Saver's Credit](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-savers-credit) to get a tax credit (better than a deduction!) for a portion of your IRA or 401k contributions, even for Roth contributions.  You can even deduct a contribution to get your income to qualify.  

- if you are a full-time student, you can take advantage of tax breaks such as the [American Opportunity Tax Credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/aotc) if you meet the requirements.  Note also that scholarship money for tuition is not taxable income.  

- If you have children who will be full-time students in the future, you can often get a current break on state taxes with a [529 plan](https://www.savingforcollege.com/intro-to-529s/what-is-a-529-plan).  Growth on this money is untaxed if used for educational expenses, but taxed and penalized if used for something else.  

- Gifts and inheritances are generally not taxable to the recipient, even if over $15,000.  Other untaxed ""income"" includes most insurance payouts and damage awards; child support;   rebates and credit card spending bonuses.  Remember that loans are not income, though forgiven loans typically are.  

- You don't owe any [capital gains taxes](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-are-capital-gains-taxed)  on appreciated investments until you realize them by selling, though if you do have a taxable gain, there's no benefit if you then buy something else.  You can deduct same-year realized losses from realized gains.  If you have more losses than gains, you can deduct $3000/year from other income and keep taking that loss against gains in future years until it is used up.  

- You pay [no taxes at all on long-term capital gains](https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-use-the-zero-percent-tax-rate-on-capital-gains-2388995) if your taxable income (including those gains) is less than the top of the 12% tax bracket.  That could be $105,000 gross income for a married couple filing jointly, $52,000 single.  You can can do this at any age, unless you are someone's dependent.

- Sales of a personal residence often have [no capital gains tax](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/capitalgainhomesale.asp) as well.  You have to have lived in the house as your primary residence two of the past five years; you get $250,000 per sale ($500,000 for a married couple).   This is often enough to make selling a house better financially than keeping it to rent. 

- If you rent a room in your house, part of all of your housing expenses (including insurance and utilities) [can be Schedule E expense deductions against your rental income](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tax-issues-when-renting-out-room-your-house.html) (but you need to declare the rental income.)  You don't have taxable income / deductions if your roommates who share the lease give you money to send to your  landlord.  

- You might get a 1099K for things you sold online; this is not necessarily taxable income to you, since you can reduce that income by the cost of the items you sold.  If you received a 1099K reporting income that wasn't really yours , e.g. for selling something on behalf of someone else, use a [nominee distribution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominee-distribution.asp) declaration to avoid being taxed on it.

- If your spouse owes money to the federal government from before you were married, use an [injured spouse](https://www.irs.gov/irm/part25/irm_25-018-005.html) form to keep the IRS from withholding your share of a joint tax refund.  This is different than an [innocent spouse](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc205.html) situation, where your spouse tried to evade taxes without your knowledge.

Retirement:

- Think you make too much money to contribute to  a Roth IRA?  Think again!  The [Backdoor Roth IRA](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/backdoor-roth-ira-high-income-how-to-guide/) may work for you.  There's even a [mega-backdoor Roth](http://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/) for high-income people with certain 401k plans.

- Always take the 401k match if you have it.  Employer contributions to your 401k [don't count](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112315/how-401k-matching-works.asp) against the 19.5k limit.  

- If you change you mind about making an IRA contribution, e.g. your income becomes too high for it to be deductible  / allowable, or you just contributed too much, you can [remove the money](https://investor.vanguard.com/ira/excess-contribution) or recharacterize / convert the money to another type of IRA before the tax filing deadline without penalty.

- Self-employed people have [lots of options](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-for-self-employed-people) for retirement accounts, including a solo-401k and a SEP IRA.  This can apply even if you have employment retirement savings.  The solo-401k allows more contributions but has to be set up in advance. 

Health insurance:

- If you change jobs and don't have insurance coverage for a time, you have 60 days to elect continuing (COBRA) coverage, during which time you are eligible to be covered even if you haven't and won't pay for it.  [This works retroactively](http://www.mymoneyblog.com/cobra-and-retroactive-health-insurance-coverage.html); you can decide to take COBRA at day 59 if you do have major expenses, pay for it, and be covered for the previous 59 days.  

- You have to have an [HSA-eligible HDHP](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-high-deductible-health-plan-is-hsa-qualified) to contribute to an HSA.  You can keep prior contributions even after you give up an HDHP, you just can't contribute more to it.  If you change plans mid-year, it might change how much you can contribute to your HSA that year.  

- The penalty for lack of health care coverage is gone at the federal level, but check if your state has a penalty now.  There are five states including California with a penalty, as well as DC.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lv9a8o/personal_finance_tips_you_may_not_know_including/,1614605512.0,909,909,0
3,"Someone tried to clear my checking account and ended up taking $18,500 before I noticed","Checked my bank balance this weekend and noticed that over the course of the past 3 weeks using 6 transactions, starting on the 4th of February , someone has been pulling money out of my account and transferring it to some scam website. All of these were done through ACH transfers.

At first, I figured it was someone I knew who has pulled shady shit before who might've gained access to my account or routing number but realized it might just be my computer that's compromised.

I've closed/suspended all my accounts, contacted the merchant and my bank. The website basically said ""tough shit, your loss"" while my bank said they will conduct an investigation and give me a credit for the amount loss until they can determine whether I'm protected under their terms or not.  They decided to break it up into two claims because the website operates under two different names (wtf?) for those specific transactions.

I'm just wondering, am I screwed? This is my life's savings and thinking about how I might never see this money again is giving me an ulcer.

4,"Mattress Store is asking me to ""come sign something"" >1 month after a purchase","I apologize if I'm posting this in the wrong area. Just not sure where else to ask, and what my responsibility is here. 

About a month and a half ago I was in the market for a new mattress. After doing my research and shopping around, I went with a local mattress store close to my home. They had some great deals and promotional financing so I signed up for their instore credit card with the intention of paying off the full balance of the mattress shortly thereafter. I picked up my mattress a few days later and brought it home and it has been a godsend for my sleep pattern. 

Well, since then I received the paperwork in the mail about the in-store financing. There were instructions to register for an account on Synchrony Bank's website where I could make a payment. I followed the instructions, registered, and lo and behold my account didn't reflect a balance. No big deal, maybe the charge didn't hit yet. So I've been waiting. When nearly a month had passed and the website still reflects a zero balance, I got a little worried so I called Synchrony and spoke with one of their reps who told me that my account reflected $0 and that no purchases had hit the account yet. I explained that this didn't make much sense to me, and I was a little concerned because I've had the mattress for a month now. He asked: ""You've had the mattress for a month?"" and I said yes. He really had no further advice for me beyond continuing to monitor the account. 

Well, I was just called by the store rep I bought the mattress from, who told me that the bank had called their store to inform them of this. She said that ""this happened twice to two other people on the day you bought your mattress,"" and told me that I needed to come into the store to sign more paperwork. I'm concerned that I'm falling into some sort of shady debt scheme, and that I'm going to be making myself accountable for something that I shouldn't by going in and signing more paperwork. I mean, they already have my social security number and the paperwork I signed on the day I purchased the mattress. Are there certain questions I should ask when I go to the store before I sign anything?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvgip8/mattress_store_is_asking_me_to_come_sign/,1614623422.0,83,83,0

7,Just hit a year's worth of salary in retirement before hitting 30. Can I lower contributions to retirement without it hurting me?,"I just turned 27, just got bumped up significantly in salary to 80.5k. No debt and I've kept things pretty simple. I've worked full time at the same job since I was 22.

&#x200B;

Total Retirement: 82k

401k: \~70k

Roth: \~10k (in my mind this is my emergency fund since I can withdraw at any point without penalty, but if I don't need it, then it's retirement).

&#x200B;

I have about 12k in cash and I own a reliable CRV worth maybe 12k. I contribute 11% pre-tax salary to my 401k and my company gives me a lump sum of 6k on top of that (4% match or 6k lump sum, whichever is more, so long as you contributed 4%), so I contribute what feels like a lot. I always tried to make sure I was prioritizing my retirement savings as young as possible, so I could benefit from years of growth. But I'm feeling really burnt out lately with work and life, and  I'd like to shift my priorities and save for a house, or at the very least, some ""nicer"" things like new furniture, or maybe a vacation once I'm vaccinated. Basically I'd like to build equity in a house, or barring that, just ""enjoy"" things a little more now.

I have no real interest in FIRE, as I'm a fairly career-oriented person, so if I'm planning on retiring at a normal age and have all those decades of growth, do I need to continue contributing so much? Am I potentially ruining my financial future if I cut my contributions down to half or even to the match?

&#x200B;

One fear maybe worth mentioning is that even if I cut my contributions and start saving like crazy, I'll probably never be able to afford a down payment for a home in my area (SLC, UT) just given that the cost of homes far outpaces my ability to save. Median home price here is like 350k for a very run-down starter home. New or nicer condos / townhomes are running 400k+. So a 20% down payment would be between 60 and 80k. If I'll never be able to afford a house, does it just make sense to give up and keep contributing?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: For those asking - I had an additional 12k in an ACTUAL emergency fund, but I spent it last summer and fall on classes at the local university -- finished 32 credits of medical school pre-reqs with the idea that if I became too burnt out in my career, I could switch careers. So that is where that money went. Also just paid off my CRV, so I didn't always have good cash flow. 

Can probably save 1500 to 1800 a month if I became very disciplined with budgeting. Just need to balance mental health considerations / vacations, etc. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvkc5r/just_hit_a_years_worth_of_salary_in_retirement/,1614632273.0,31,31,0
8,"30-Day Challenge #3: Prepare your tax return accurately and file early (March, 2021)","# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Prepare your Tax Return Accurately, and File Early**. 

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've filed your US federal income tax return by March 31st.

Recommended Steps:

###Plan
1. **Learn how US income taxes work:**
* Watch [Basics of US income tax rate schedule](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/basics-of-us-income-tax-rate-schedule)
* Watch [Tax deductions introduction](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/tax-deductions-introduction)
* Read /r/personalfinances's very own [wiki page on income tax](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes)
* *Understand* what exactly your tax return is: A form you fill out, telling the government how much money you made, calculating how much taxes you owe on that money (your ""tax liability""), and ""squaring-up"" with the government: Figuring out if you already paid more than your actual tax liability throughout the year with paycheck withholdings (in which case you will get a tax *refund*), or if you haven't paid enough throughout the year, and owe a balance to the government.
2. [Determine your filing status](https://www.irs.gov/uac/what-is-my-filing-status) and determine whether you can be claimed as a dependent by anyone (for example, your parents), or can claim any dependents. ([IRS Dependent Tool](https://www.irs.gov/uac/who-can-i-claim-as-a-dependent))
3. **Prepare a ""map"" for what documentation you will need to fill out your tax return**, then go through the list and make sure you have the documentation for each. **Don't worry if you forget something.** The software you use to fill out your tax return (or the tax return form itself) will remind you of things you might have forgotten.
* Jot down every possible way you made money this year (remember, even if you don't get a form, you still need to report it):
    * paycheck from my job (W-2 form)
    * interest on my bank account (personal records like your December account statement, or a 1099 form)
    * dividends from my stock (1099-Div)
    * income from my small business or self employment (personal records, or 1099 form)
* Make a list of all the possible deductions you might think you are eligible for, and make sure you have documentation:
    * mortgage interest you paid (1098)
    * student loan interest you paid (1098-E)
    * education expenses (1098-T)
    * state or local income taxes (W-2)
    * charitable contributions (personal records)

### Prepare and file your Tax Return
**Using one of the following methods**

1. See if you are eligible for [completely free tax return preparation software](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free) sponsored by the IRS
2. Use paid (or free) tax return preparation software. Examples: TaxAct, TurboTax, CreditKarma, AARP, FreeTaxUSA, TaxSlayer. [See our megathread for discussion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search?q=title%3A%28Tax+Filing+Software+Megathread%29&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=year#res-hide-options)
3. ""Manually"" fill out the tax return form online using [IRS Free Fillable Forms](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free)

By starting early, it allows you more time to deal with unanticipated questions about your tax return. ""Wait, can I claim my girlfriend as a dependent""? ""Do I have to report income from renting out the spare room in my house to a friend?"". When these come up, feel free to create [a new post](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/submit?selftext=true) asking for help with as much details as you can provide.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lv8lxa/30day_challenge_3_prepare_your_tax_return/,1614603605.0,80,80,0

13,Stay in full-time job or go part time? Home loan,"Hey everyone,

My plan is to buy property around Sept/Oct this year. I currently work as a nurse in a full time job that pays $38/hr. I have the opportunity switch to a ""per diem"" employment status making $65/hr with full confidence that full time hours are and will continue to be available for the foreseeable future. 

The problem with the per diem job is I could not obtain a letter of full time employment (40 hrs per week) when applying for a home loan. Banks have requested this in the past and they seem to get uneasy when this can't be produced. 

My question then, do I stay in the lower paying full-time job for the sake of painting a picture of security and increasing my chances of getting approved, or do I quit and make double the money?

16,"Merchant accepted a partial chargeback, refunded 70% of the disputed charge to the credit card.

I raised a dispute with my citi credit card, and citi investigated the charge. The merchant responded, and accepted the chargeback for the total charge MINUS a 100$ cancellation fee, and has apparently refunded the remaining money on Nov 10 2020.

Citi however, fails to accept this (because the dispute was for 1200, they nicely took 1100 and they say that my dispute failed because the merchant did not refund 1200), and charged me for the full 1200$ back, while the airline refunded the 1100 to Citi. They now want to keep my money and charge me for 1200. They wont let me open a dispute for 1100 and they wont refund me the 1100 which the merchant refunded. I spent so much time with customer service and I dont seem to understand why they wont understand when I ask to refund the money which the customer accepted as a chargeback in the dispute documentation.

I suggested that he just use the gift cards for his daily expenses and pay off the bills using the freed-up cash available in his checking account. But he's insistent on getting the cash off those cards.

Is there any way to do this? I've seen some of the gift card resale sites, but they seem a little skeevy to me. And coin star doesn't seem to allow their trade in system anymore either.

18,My Top 3 Personal Finance Tips," Thought I would share my top 3 personal finance tips that have helped me in my life:

**1. Live within your means**

To most in this sub this will seem obvious; however for many it is not something they deliberately consider. Someone who earns $50K/year and spends $40K of it is much better off in the long run than someone who earns $100K/year and spends $102K. It's not uncommon to see people with high paying jobs with flashy cars and lavish lifestyles that are actually swimming in debt and struggling to stay afloat. Often it is the people who live modestly who have a higher level of wealth from building up savings and investments over time. As a general rule, you should try to save 20% of your income for the future. Savings should be invested (there are plenty of subs on that topic so I will leave it at that), which will lead to wealth accumulation over the long term.

**2. A dollar saved is like $1.50 earned**

Personal income tax rates vary depending on income and state, however using an average rate of 33% means you would need to earn $1.50 to have $1 in after tax income. Hence, it pays to be careful with how you spend your after-tax dollars. Here are some tips:

\- price match on big ticket items, particularly at big box stores that offer lowest price guarantees. Some of these stores even offer additional discounts if you find a lower price, which can benefit those who identify a big price discrepancy. There are several phone apps that can help expedite this process.

\- if you are looking to buy something but don't need it urgently, check several stores online and track prices for a few weeks to ensure you are getting a good deal. There are also several price tracking websites that will show you product prices over time on major sites like Amazon.

\- wait for sales. I generally buy clothes only 2-3 times a year during Black Friday and other clearance events. I also buy after the season ends or is about to end. February/March is the best time to look for a new winter coat, boots etc. while Fall is the best time to buy a new air conditioner or lawn mower. 

\- buy used, particularly for large depreciating assets like cars. There is little difference between a brand new car and a 2-3 year old car, with the exception of price. According to the book ""The Millionaire Next Door"", 37% of millionaires buy their cars used.

**3. Organize and manage debt by interest rate**

Debt can be a useful tool if used for investment purposes, such as to invest in yourself by helping pay for higher education, or to invest in the purchase of a place to live. Debt is bad when it is used for consumption, such as entertainment, vacations, or even daily essentials, all of which should come from your cash earnings. Credit card debt and pay day loans are by far the worst, with interest rates in excess of 18-20% in most cases. If you find yourself with too much bad debt, here is what I would suggest to get out of debt:

\- list out all of your debts including balances owing, interest rate, and minimum payments

\- sort the list from lowest interest rate to highest interest rate

\- only make the minimum monthly payment on the lowest interest rate items. In some cases you may be able to go to the lender and ask for payments to be deferred or reduced to help minimize this repayment.

\- move down the list and ensure you make the minimum payment on all debts. Paying each month will prevent your credit scores from dropping too low.

\- take any excess cash you have each month and apply to the last item until it is fully paid off. Keep working up the list until all of the high interest debts are fully paid off.

\- avoid declaring bankruptcy at all costs. Bankruptcy will permanently show up in your credit checks and can even prevent you from getting a job in the future (many employers perform both criminal and credit checks as part of their standard hiring procedures).

The house is in my dads name but he doesn’t live there and isn’t really in the picture so he’s no help, he just wants it sold. My moms Will was also written before I was born so I am not included in it. She specifically named who receives what do it is pretty well sealed from me being included. 

My first question is this. I have a fully paid off car in a 2018 Kia Optima (the insurance is VERY expensive). I called my insurance provider and they said the price of the car makes it expensive to insure, should I sell it and downgrade? I’m terrified what the rate will be now that I could be insuring it under my own one car plan.

School supplies are covered. I have a nice computer for school so things are good on that end. My phone is also paid off so I would just need to start a new service plan on it or join a friend’s.

My dad and siblings said I need to be out in a week or they will file an eviction notice which will give me 30 days but that will be on my record....

21,How much cash is too much?,"Hello, 

I was hoping to get some advice about my savings/investing situation. Specifically, I am concerned that I may have too much cash and not enough money invested, although I welcome more general advice as well. 

I am a 24 year old PhD student making ~$36,000/yr (combination of stipend & teaching salary). I currently have no loans/debt, pay rent of ~$900/month, and save ~$1050/month ($400 cash savings, $650 invested). The breakdown of my money is as follows:

Cash (~$18,000):

- $5000 emergency fund (I am at very low risk to lose my job)

- $2000 vacation savings for after COVID

- $11,000 cash savings for ""future""


Investments (~$18,000)

- $6000 Roth IRA

- $12,000 Taxable Portfolio of mainly index funds


Given my situation, I was wondering what I should do with this ~$11,000 cash savings for ""future"". I'd like to invest it but I'm not sure what my situation will be in ~4 years when I graduate, and I'm nervous about putting too much into investment accounts, in case I need some of the money soon. (I'm not at all nervous about long-term investments, but the market can be down shorter-term and I'm uncertain as to whether I'll need the money/how much I'll need).

22,Turbotax bug: Mis-handling backdoor Roth IRAs,"I filed my taxes with TurboTax this year (old habits die hard), and just got a notification from them saying that my return was rejected due to a ""potential issue with the calculation of your Taxable Inherited IRA."" I don't have an inherited IRA, but I did do Backdoor Roth IRA this year. I imagine many folks on this sub do as well, so wanted to share here.

Sure enough, the TurboTax app confirmed that there's a bug:

>We are reviewing updates to Taxable Inherited IRA calculations. We expect to have these updates done by March 5th, 2021.

So if you did a Backdoor Roth IRA contribution this year and filed with TT, don't freak out (yet?) and hopefully they'll have this fixed on Friday. In the meantime, if you're like me, it's time to think about your life choices and seriously consider switching next year.

25,Parent recently widowed and in debt with no retirement,"My mom was recently widowed at age 70.

My first question immediately on hearing the news was asking where she was at financially, if that is a clue what mess she is in.

My stepdad was in poor health so it wasn't surprising when he passed. She has worked her whole life 40-60 hours a week in the nursing field and makes around 70k a year. They were also collecting his veteran benefits but since she is his second wife and was not married to him while he was in the service those are about to be cut sharply back. She can also collect around 2k a month in social security but that might mean cutting back her work hours.

She has no 401k or pension to speak of. They recently refinanced their house so might have 40-50k equity at most. In general they have lived a very expensive life style (expensive trips and toys, leasing cars etc) and now the that lifestyle is crashing down.

She was two credit cards at 11k that she is aware of, many other credit cards such as cosco etc of course all maxed out.

They had one pickup that they were paying $900 a month on that will go up for auction. Hopefully she only ends up owing 4-5k on that.

They had another car for her they paid $500 a month and owe 17-18k on still.

They had an RV they owed 68k and were making $700 dollar a month payments on. The dealership is just going to repose that.

They somehow had 3 phones and the monthly bill was around $800 (!) but she think that was to pay off one of the phones.

Selling his hobby cars and tools she is hoping to get around 10-12k.

In general she has a steady job and 7k in the bank at age 70 and we are estimating 50-60k in debt.

Since I feel most of these wounds are self inflicted I do want to help my mom out but not at the risk of bankrupting my family.

My sister had a good suggestion that my Mom contact a financial advisor or attorney to get everything straightened out and figure if debt consolidation was a good idea. I have no problem paying for such a service.

My question for you redditors is what type of financial advisor/attorney should I tell her to find near her? What would roughly the expected fees be and how can we verify we found a good one? I have no problem paying the fees but don't want to be milked or taken advantage of either.

Throw away account for obvious reasons!

Update: Thanks everyone for the great advice! A few clarifications.

* The 800 dollar phone bill seems to be some sort of one time fee for upgrading her phone. Same pattern of always having the latest and greatest even though they couldn't afford it. The actual monthly is around 200 so still way to high and she has cut two of the phones (still not sure why they had 3 phones...)
* She is actually 68 1/2. Based on the advice it seems she might be able to draw her passed husbands social security until she hits 70.
* She has contacted a bankruptcy lawyer! We are going to review the advice.
* The RV was not tow but self driving so a completely stupid monthly payment. They have not even used it in last 3-4 years except 1 to 2 times a year.
   * I did a quick calculation how much money they would have in an IRA if they had paid $700 a month into that instead...
* The truck was due to his disability (not able to walk) BUT was massively overkill and they kept leasing vehicles to get the ""latest and greatest"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lurxqh/parent_recently_widowed_and_in_debt_with_no/,1614550117.0,194,194,0
26,Traditional vs Roth IRA when I already have a Roth 401k,I have a Roth 401k set up through my employer that I'm putting money into up to the point where they no longer match.

27,"With interest rates so low, would it be better to put down 5% on a new mortgage and invest the remaining, or to stick with the traditional 20%?","I am looking at buying another house. I can afford a traditional down payment of 20%. While that may be advisable for lower monthly payments, it makes more sense to me to pay the minimum and throw the difference in an ETF or other investment. 

Tell me if my logic is off. Assuming a $600,000 house. A 20% down payment would be $120,000. A 5% down payment would be $30,000 and only impact the monthly mortgage price by $400ish per month. Total additional interest expense over the loan would be about $45,000 ($285k - $240k @ 2.9%).

Now if I were to take that additional $90,000 and invest and earn 8% on that money, it would be worth $905,000 (gain of $815,000) over the same 30 year period. Why wouldn't I want to do this? This seems like a no brainer for me.

My parent’s accountant claimed me as a dependent as usual, so I couldn’t claim myself and take advantage of the recovery rebate credit. A bunch of my peers did claim themselves, saying their parents only get $500 for claiming them and they’d just pay them the difference. 

My parent’s accountant told them they’d be losing out on $4400 and I’d get $3200 (don’t know where he came up with this number from).

My understanding of federal taxes for 2020 was that adult dependents are only a $500 credit from what I read online, so I’m confused. Can’t speak with the accountant directly because he won’t discuss their return with me.

34,Tmobile Money change?,"Hey all,
After seeing posts on here, I finally pulled the trigger last month and opened a TMobile Money account. I'm a TMobile customer, and making a $200 deposit every month into what essentially functions as a savings account seems easy enough. Well, as of March 31st, they are changing the terms so that instead of making a deposit, you have to make 10 purchases with your debit card each month, and those purchases have to clear by the end of the month. This is WAY more of a hassle for me, mainly because I would be transferring money from my other checking account to compensate for those debit purchases, and the transfers take like a week. It seems like a huge pain in the ass to basically be adding another account on top of my credit cards and regular checking account that I have to balance and pay off at the end of the month like a credit card. Plus, my regular checking account is tied to a round up savings account, and that's usually like 10 bucks a month that ends up getting stashed away. Obviously 1% is still great, but i'm wondering if other folks are having the same dilemma with whether or not to continue keeping that account open?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvl8td/tmobile_money_change/,1614634500.0,2,2,0

36,Explain periodically “Taking Profits”,"In many investment realms (mainly stock market, cryptocurrencies) I hear the adage remember to “take some profits”. On the surface this is simple– you can’t time markets, profit is profit, dont get greedy, bird in the hand, etc. 

I get that but at a deeper level I have trouble doing it. If I have my money in an investment that is growing or I believe will grow, why would I exchange that opportunity for fiat, unless I needed the fiat to buy something?  

With most assets, converting an investment to fiat also carries with it taxation. This part seems strange to me because if its a good investment there is a high chance I continue investing in that thing so I am basically selling it to take some profits, and then buying back in over time at possibly higher prices and paying more taxes when I sell it again to take more profits. 

Anyway, interested to hear some opinions from this community on taking profits and some strategies in doing so.

39,Should I tell my brother I’m paying for his college tuition?,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting to Reddit so apologies in advance for any novice errors.

I grew up low-income and was very fortunate to have graduated college through the aid of scholarships, grants, and loans (I’m a first-gen grad, fwiw). I landed a pretty decent job after graduating and have been helping my parents and sibling with expenses since.

My brother is off to school this fall and I’d always planned to help pay for his tuition, but I’m not sure if the right thing is to tell him up front, or have him believe he’s liable for school payments and have him take out *subsidized loans* (this is important because they are 0% interest loans while he’s in school), and make a bulk payment once he’s graduated. I ask because I think there’s a personal finance/ownership lesson to be learned here, especially since he’s kind of always leaning on me, but I don’t want him to feel stressed while he’s in school. I should note that any discretionary expenses or emergencies I will 100% cover and he knows this—I’m purely talking about taking out loans for tuition. I suppose there’s also a secondary effect that taking out loans would give me more time to save $ (don’t have a ton saved right now), but the question really is about whether or not I should tell him my plans.

TL;DR: I know what it’s like to navigate college under the extreme pressure of worrying about paying for tuition and don’t want him to go through the same. But, at the same time, I’m not sure if I’d be taking away an opportunity for him to be self-sufficient and learn about finances now if I front-load this info. 

Would appreciate any thoughts, and thanks in advance.

******Update: wow, thanks everyone for all of these comments...I woke up this morning stunned by how supportive you all are. Truly in shock!!! I completely agree about not making my brother work 40 hours a week, and to be clear, that was never the plan.

41,I think I majorly screwed up my credit.,"Background: 26 years old, married, with a household income of $70,000. Most of that goes to rent, car payments, and insurance. 

Over the years, my husband and I have accrued $20,000 in debt from our wedding, from when my husband was deep into his gambling addiction, and moving. When I was in between jobs/working less hours (due to Covid) I was using my credit card for groceries, gas, bills, many car repairs, and yes the occasional impulse purchase, I accrued an additional $11,000 to that. 

So total debt is now $31,000.

I had the $11,000 in a Chase Sapphire and Chase Freedom card that has a 4% interest rate. The $20,000 is in a Freedom Plus personal loan for debt consolidation at a whopping 22%. 

Last week, Freedom Plus called me asking if I would like to refinance my current loan. The loan officer entered the amount and it got denied because my debt to income ratio was too high. She told me if I put my cc debt into a second loan with them, I could get a better interest rate for both loans down the line. However, my interest on this loan is also 22%. They have allowed me to refinance in the past on my other loan, which started at 26%. She said that it is actually more beneficial for me to pay my debt this way versus paying a cc which she says accrues interest every day. I believed her, and signed the dotted line. 

Now I'm wondering if I made a mistake. I don't use my cards anymore. In fact, I cut them all up except for my Sapphire card because I can use it in any country (I'm a flight attendant). And I haven't charged it in at least 7 months, except for the times I was in another country and needed to use it. 
 
I am serious about working on my debt. I've made an emergency fund with $1,500 in it so far, so that I would never need to use my cc for emergencies. I have a 401k going as well. 

Did I make a mistake? What can I do to fix this? Was this really beneficial for me or was I just made a fool of?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvjhvp/i_think_i_majorly_screwed_up_my_credit/,1614630189.0,2,2,0

50,Move to a new place or stay put,"Hello everyone!

Currently, I live in a townhome; since 2002-2003.  The townhome has been payed for quite awhile. I live with another person, but we are not married. Together, but not married (yet). The question is, we both have considered moving out of the townhome and into something else, whether a town home or an actual house.

Here are some details around the situation

I bought the townhome at $175k, its now worth $220k. I have (recently) put in about $40k worth of work on it (furnace, AC, windows, floors, appliances, bathroom remodel etc). However, there are issues that really bother us.  The house leaks air bad, and replacing the windows did not help (we got ripped off essentially). We live in the northern climate where winter can (and did) get to -25 degrees farenheight.  During that 1-2 weeks we use space heaters to help with that, our brand new furnace overheats and causes a repair man to come out every year - horrible air flow.  During the Fall, wasps are a constant hassle, and I spend considerable time killing them off.  You cannot sit outside without attracting wasps.  We are in our 50s and ideally want to retire around 60.  Buying a different place would not hurt financially that much. We have no outstanding debt, we pay cash for everything.

Recently, my better half (and myself) realized that we could have a much nicer place if we sold off our current place and each pitched in $50k or so to buy something different.  Everything we look at, looks nicer than what we have even after the work we put into the house.

One of the issues, with a different place is the market will not allow a person time needed to pin down the right house.  You see something, you have to move on it, often times without an inspection.

One thought is to stick with the current townhome for 1-2 more years, dealing with our winters (heck, its only for 4-5 months of the year), and save even more money for that ""last home we buying"" house.

Maybe the 1-2 more years is the right decision, thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvh3l5/move_to_a_new_place_or_stay_put/,1614624779.0,2,2,0

I see that the Vanguard Total Stock Market Admiral Shares has an ER of 0.04 (which I am aware is very low). The corresponding ETF has an ER 0.03. So wouldn't it make sense to convert all my shares in my Roth IRA to the ETF? My thinking is that this will save money in the long run.

I feel like there has to be some negative here that I am not clear on. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

53,Concerned that someone is using my identity for credit,"To preface, I'm 20 years old, never opened a credit card, never took out student (or any) loans, and have paid cash or debit for everything my entire life. I am an ""approved user"" on one of my parents credit cards, but I don't actually have my name/social/info on anything regarding that card.

I recently applied for an apartment in my area, and they pulled mine and my roommates-to-be credit scores. My roommates are in the same situation, no credit, no loans, etc. When they came back, our credit was disclosed to us, and they all had a credit score of ""4"" (This seems to be the default when you have no credit?"") but my score came back as a 729.

I'm concerned that my identity was used to open a fraudulent line of credit, but I can't pull my credit reports because every time I try to enter my information (current and previous) it tells me the information I'm entering is incorrect compared to the information the credit bureaus have on file.

I have tried to call equifax (the bureau they pulled my credit through) and was told they either could not tell me what's on my report, or that there was no file to pull from.

With family visiting from out of state, and kids on the way, we're considering building an addition over our garage that would add \~700sq. ft and a bedroom/bathroom/office. Somewhere for the in-laws to stay if they were with us for extended periods.

Our home has appreciated by \~35% since we purchased in 2018. I've gotten a few estimates for the addition and I assume it could be done for $150-200k. I have the capital to pay for this, but I think it would be wise to finance the project if possible.

One option is a HELOC, which gets a \~3.25% variable rate revolving line of credit for 10-years. I'm curious if the community would suggest any other options for this type of investment/project?

63,Discussion on logistics of retiring early - tax-advantaged and brokerage accounts - how do you retire early without paying retirement account penalties?,"I have a spreadsheet to track our various retirement accounts. When me and my wife are at age 50, my calculation suggests we can retire and withdraw 4% to meet our current lifestyle expenses.

Upon further inspection I'm discovering that may not be true!  Most of our money is in tax-advantaged accounts of some type that we can't withdraw from at age 50 (without penalty). From my research it looks like the following is the case:

**401k** - cannot withdraw any money without penalty until age 59.5, money is then taxed as income

**IRA** - cannot take out money until age 59.5 without penalty, and then is taxed as income

**Roth IRA** - can take out principal tax-free but cannot take out money earned on investment until age 59.5 without penalty

**HSA** - can take out only for health expenses until age 65, then you can take out for any reason but you are taxed if non-health related

**Brokerage account** - can take out money any time, but are taxed on gains at 15% (assuming long term capital gains tax here)

So it seems that to retire early, you have to dip heavily into Roth IRA principal and brokerage accounts until the age of 59.5 when your other money becomes available. It seems like the constraints of an early retirement increase the financial risk of those early retirement years (unexpected non-medical expense could drastically increase tax burden) whereas if you had all your accounts available, you could more strategically withdraw money to avoid a hefty tax bill.

Early retirees, what has been your strategy? Did you set up your accounts years ago to prepare for early retirement? Are you comfortably taking the penalty and withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts?

Early Retirement planners, how are you navigating the 59.5 rule?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvm64l/discussion_on_logistics_of_retiring_early/,1614636810.0,1,1,0
64,Student recently without car working minimum wage; not sure how to go about buying a car (or whether I should finance),"I'm a 21 year-old student attending a local commuter college (though I am taking this semester off) and also work about 30 hours a week ($9.50/hr) and lost my car, both the job and the lack of car are recent developments. It was a used one I got around 18 which basically gave up due to age. I'm living at home currently, but my home life is not good. We only have one car at home now which my parents have been letting me drive to and from work only. 

I have no savings (all of my savings have gone towards college payments) and before this, have been trying to decrease my credit card debt (I have about $1000 in debt currently, also from trying to pay for college expenses). My parents can provide no help for any of my expenses except for health insurance, nor my next car purchase. (They also file me dependent, so I do not think I'm eligible for the upcoming stimulus check.)

My rough plan has been to save up about $2000-$3000 and buy a used car, though this will take months and I'm quickly losing my sanity being trapped at home all the time. I will not be able to use the car come fall semester, which I want to attend. I'm planning on taking out student loans going forward, instead of trying to pay out of pocket.

I don't mean to turn this into a personal post, but I am feeling completely hopeless right now. I know financing would require full car insurance as well. Is there any way financing could be feasible? I'm completely immobile and feeling increasingly trapped.

They mentioned that Merrill Edge was an option.

I have a retirement fund (state of MA public employee pension) that I paid into from my previous job that I can either ""Direct Rollover to a Traditional IRA"" or ""Direct Rollover to an Eligible Retirement Plan"" (which I have with my current employer, a 401(a) retirement plan).

I'm concerned about moving my IRA to Merrill Edge, as the non-advisor person on the phone stated that I may not be able to continue to hold an AIG allocation in my portfolio if my account becomes ""unmanaged"" and so they wanted to check first (still haven't heard).

So, I guess my options are:

**Option 1** - open a NEW traditional IRA (Vanguard, Schwaab, etc.) and directly rollover my previous pension to it; directly rollover my existing Merrill Lynch IRA to it;

**Option 2** - directly rollover my previous pension to my current employer's eligible retirement plan (state of RI public employee 401(a) plan); directly rollover my existing Merrill Lynch IRA to the new traditional IRA (option 2A), or move it to Merrill Edge (option 2B).

Thoughts on this?  Thoughts on Merrill Edge?  Where can I find information on the ""best"" place to get a traditional IRA (I'd be nervous to manage the whole thing on my own without some guidance)?  Is it worthwhile to consolidate accounts or is it a best practice to keep them separate?

rented an apartment complex and broke the lease early stating to them the mold issue was never resolved so i need to move out for health concerns.

i got the final invoice and it was a very high amount - $4,126. One of the line items was a fee for fixing the mold ($250).. the very same mold i used against them in breaking the lease. I argued this fee as well as requested a negotiated fee for breaking the lease early. The manager refused the negotiation and some disagreements ensued. Whenever i brought up the mold fee and ""where in lease was i liable"" she wouldn't reply, or if she did, would say something like ""we have to go by the balance"".

today i logged into my portal and noticed my account isnt allowed to make any payments and the ENTIRE balance was written off; all line items. I dont know what this means...

87,Optimally taking advantage of my situation?,"Hello folks. I am not so far removed from college (22M) and recently began a financial analyst position at a large company in a big city. Annually I will be making a little above US average, but for the time being, I will be living at home (with parents) and therefore not be paying rent for the time being.

Because I have this relatively nice source of income coming in, and also not paying rent/don’t have student loan debt, I don’t want to touch a large rate of my income coming in every paycheck so I can invest/save it. As we speak, I have a mutual fund from sports betting wins made a few years back that is now at a value of ~ $40-45k (almost doubled in past 3-4 years). Obviously there’s a variety of ways to go about my situation, and I know I’m fortunate to be where i’m at (relatively), but I want to start looking into ways I can invest/save/potentially create passive sources of income, or even just add more consistent funds to my mutual fund. I was wondering good places to look about going forward with a plan or if anyone who found/finds themselves in a similar circumstance knew of ways to exponentially grow what I currently have.

88,Social security Overpayment story; need help,"So I will try to explain this crazy situation me and wife are going through right now. My father-in-law died suddenly before we got married. 2 weeks before our own wedding, she receives a letter from SS stating that she was over paid $15,000! Then come to find out, her dad actually did receive checks from SS that he claimed he was injured and couldn't work BUT was working contract for a company while still receiving SS checks while my wife was STILL in high school. My wife and mother-in-law knew nothing about his finances until we were engaged and unfortunately he was a gambling addict/con that even opened bank accounts in my wife's name when she was a minor and her family never saw or used any of the SS money, only him.  

The final straw was when SS withheld our income tax right when COVID-19 hit and we really needed the money at the time and SS used it as a payment towards the balance owed, and SS still wants my wife to pay them. My question is, can an attorney help with this type of case especially if we have proof he was working at the time he committed SS fraud in her name while she was a minor and can we get our income tax back?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvlc5v/social_security_overpayment_story_need_help/,1614634745.0,1,1,0

92,Lower MAGI for 2021 Retirement Contribution/Other Questions,"Hello All,

Realizing that I could've taken advantage of lowering my MAGI to be put into a lower income tax bracket in 2020, I would like to avoid my mistakes that I did so I'm reaching out here for advice.

This will be a couple of list of questions for your guy's guidance/help.

Retirement:

1) Employer Funded 401k - I contribute to this POST-TAX about 10k, with employer matching of the remaining limit.   
\- Question: Is it better to do pre-tax to lower my MAGI? I noticed that my GF did this by accident this lowered her taxable income. Also, my employer offers POST-TAX and PRE-TAX contriubtions, hence why my GF was contributing pre-tax, which lowered her taxable income, what's the difference between this and Traditional IRA?

2) Opening up Traditional vs Roth IRA - In 2020, my taxable income was in the 24% range, I would like to lower this, I know there are limit of Roth IRA and I don't think I'm eligible for it because of my MAGI in 2020. 

\- Question: I have opened a Traditional IRA with Fidelity (my employer 401k as well), how can I contribute pre-tax contributions to this from my paycheck with my same employer? Fidelity is only giving me the option of a check transfer/bank transfer/rollover.

&#x200B;

3) HSA - I can contribute to this as well to lower my MAGI, however, I'm pretty healthy, but we never know what may happen in the future.

\- Question: Mathematically, $3600 may not seem a lot, but could be the difference in the world later on down the line, I just bought a house and could use more of my money into renovation/other work, is this critical for me to have right now as a 23(M).

95,Better to Buy Used in Full or Finance and Buy New,"I've seen a couple of these posts but I've been talking myself over the fence both ways. 

My background is I'm 29 with no debt. I make \~$43k a year.  I pay my credit card off each month in full. I have a credit score of 762 last I checked this past month. 

I've been in the market for a car for about 2 years now, after the engine died on my last used car. Spent the time bike commuting to save up to pay off that loan, quickly, and start saving for my next car. I've been able to save up over the past 6 months and was expecting to put $7,500 down on a car and finance the rest for a \~$15k car.  As of last month, I was gifted a portion of a relatives ($10k) life insurance to help with the cost of a car. 

Immediately, my thought was to just pay the car in full, but after having issues with a used car in the past and being skeptical on CarFax reports on cars that I've found over the past few months, I've become interested in exploring the option of a new car closer to $30k.  My logic with this is I'm hoping this car will end up being a long term car that lasts me 10+ years. I'm considering putting $15k down for a new car that way I can keep monthly payments under $300 and leave $2k in savings. 

My girlfriend is skeptical because she hasn't had to finance a car and is current driving a '91 240 Volvo and only paid $4k for it. I'm ideally hoping to get a hybrid SUV to attempt to save in gas for daily commutes and long drives for vacations/trips to see her family. 

I can't tell if I'm idealizing the \~$30K car or if it is actually a reasonable investment. This would be my largest purchase either way, so I was hoping to get an outsiders view. 

Thanks for the help.

TL;DR: Was originally looking to purchase a \~$15k car, saved enough for a 50% down payment. Last month as gifted $10k to help with car purchase. Trying to decide between pay in full at $15k or put $15k on a down payment of a new car, leave $2k in savings and finance the rest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvl791/better_to_buy_used_in_full_or_finance_and_buy_new/,1614634387.0,1,1,0

97,House offer accepted. How do I shop for rates?,"My wife and I just got our offer on a house accepted. We will almost certainly be doing an FHA loan because our credit scores are right under 700 and we only have enough for a 3.5% down payment. The lender we got preapproved through is eager to move forward and has provided the following information:

* Purchase Price: $599,950

* Down Payment: $20,999

* Loan Amount: $578,951

* Interest Rate: 3.5%

* Points associated with this rate .4% = $2,356

He said the points were necessary because the interest rate can't be higher for an FHA loan. If true, no problem.

Is this all the info I need in order to go to other lenders and see if they can beat it? I asked the current lender about closing costs and he gave me an estimate of about $12,000 but didn't give me a specific breakdown. Is that usual? Do I just provide the above information to other potential lenders and see if they can come back with something better? Should I be worried about closing costs being inflated?

I'm filling out my IT-2104 and am pretty confused on how many allowances I should take. I saw from other posts that in general if you're single, you should take 2 for NYS and 0 for NYC.

I'm currently single, no dependents. However, I am living in WA state for the first month I start my work. So I assume I'll need to update my IT-2104 once I move to NYC? If it helps, I do plan to live in NYC when I move.

Secondly, I do have a second consulting job (which I assume I can keep once I start my new job, but need to have that clarified as well). I'm paid $65/hour but only work \~1hr per week, if that (there's certain weeks I don't work at all for this job).

I started a Traditional IRA last year, contributed the full amount, and took the deduction. This year, my income has fallen and I'm eligible for a Roth. When speaking casually with a friend who is a financial advisor, they suggested that I start a Roth, contribute the full amount, and roll the Traditional into the Roth since they are more flexible. As tax rate has dropped, I would be paying less than the deduction I took and have the money to pay it, but I'm unsure of what to do. I didn't know about backdoor Roth when I started my Traditional and at that time I did want the deduction as I was unsure of my income stability as the pandemic hit.

Other info: my work does not offer any retirement plan, I am 30 years old, and I do not expect my income to rise again to last year's rate anytime soon.

105,Buying a new vehicle conundrum.,"Currently have a truck with 150k miles and am going to sell and expecting to get $9-10k for it. (It is paid off)

I am looking at a new truck for around $44k

Currently own a car that we owe $6k on. 3.7% rate (the cars value is about $7-8k)

Currently my spouse and I have about $22k student loan debt combined atm. One payment is $150 the other $250, each loan is about $11k even.(we have knocked out half of them in about 2 years) they are federal loans with about a 4.2% rate 

I hate to say this but with the biden administration toying with the idea of student loan forgiveness and our loans being deferred we have stopped making payments and have been making our ""student loan"" payment to a savings account and will just pay a lump sum in September if the deferment ends. But im not wasting money on them if they are going to end up forgiving $10k.

We have an additional $7500 saved for our disposal on top of the $9-10k we will get for my truck. So will have about $16,500 total for spending.

So my question is what's your advice?

-Would you pay off our other car for $6k and use the remaining $10.5k for a down payment on a truck?

-Buy the truck with the $9k down payment from our current truck? And put the rest in savings to go towards student loan in September?

-Put the whole $16.5k as a down payment for the new truck? 

Any other recommendations? Thanks!

108,Did I make the wrong choice buying my parent's pre-construction condo?,"Hi everyone,

I wrote a post here and in a few other threads about a month or two ago, deciding whether to buy a condo now in the Greater Toronto Area, or taking my parents offer and buying their pre-construction condo at cost that will be ready supposedly by summer 2022.

Here's a link to the original post

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fican/comments/l0eqw6/should\_i\_buy\_a\_condo\_on\_my\_own\_now\_or\_buy\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fican/comments/l0eqw6/should_i_buy_a_condo_on_my_own_now_or_buy_my/)

After a lot of contemplating and weighing out the options, I decided to buy my parents' condo for a few reasons.

1. They bought it in 2018 and are selling it to me at the cost that they had bought it for.
2. I was originally looking for a 1+1 since I couldn't afford a two bedroom, but this opportunity gave me a chance to afford a two bedroom.
3. I figured that because it was a new-built and on a higher floor and slightly bigger, it would appreciate more over time rather than whatever I could afford now.

I met with a lawyer last Friday to go over the paperwork and do the condo assignment. A few things took me by surprise.

1. The closing costs are a lot higher for a pre-construction in Ontario rather than buying a condo that is already built. I was told I would be paying close to 30k in closing fees, land transfer tax, building levies etc.
2. I was also told that even though I plan on living in the condo, I may have to pay about 25-30k in HST, depending on the builder, although I can claim it back through the CRA. This still means that I need to have this cash ready by the time the condo is ready to close next summer.
3. I will have to pay an occupancy fee for at least a few months until the building is registered. This can be anywhere from a couple of months up to maybe even a year, and it won't go towards my mortgage. The unit is at least on the 27th floor towards the top, so it may be less time than the units below me, but it's still money being spent that I won't be getting a return on.
4. According to a real-estate agent I spoke to, when pre-construction condos are being sold, they are sold at the price predicted that they would be worth come the original closing date (was suppose to be spring of this year).

My biggest concern now is whether or not I made the right choice by buying this condo off my parents and waiting for it to be built, or should I have just bought a smaller condo now and moved in sooner? I was under the impression I was making a good investment here since it's a new building, it's bigger than anything I can afford now, plus it buys me a year and a half of saving more money by living at home so I can build an emergency fund, plus save more money and start investing in other avenues.

I didn't think that so many of these additional costs would eat away at the initial appreciation I thought I was getting, since the price of condo has supposedly gone up already to about the 630k range give or take. And although I do plan in actually living in it for at least 3-5 years, I didn't think I would have to wait so long to start seeing a return on my investment.

Did I make the wrong choice here? I don't think there's anything I can do about it since I already signed on the assignment and the condo should be under my name some time this month, but I'd like some insight.

\*Edit: I made this purchase because I want to invest my money in real estate, especially in the Toronto/Greater Toronto Area. I was thinking that after a few years of living in it that I would want to rent it out, especially since it's a two-bedroom. Would this still be a good option for me? Or would the taxes on the capital gains not be worth it when it comes time to sell it down the road?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvk88h/did_i_make_the_wrong_choice_buying_my_parents/,1614632000.0,1,1,0

110,My mom doesn’t know I filed a consumer proposal and wants me to sign mortgage documents?,"The CP was filed a couple years ago. I’m rebuilding credit but otherwise doing fine. My mom doesn’t know about any of this.

Several years ago my mom added me to the mortgage and I had a home equity loan on my credit report ($5,000). At the time I had very little established credit and didn’t know what any of this meant. I’m assuming I co-signed her mortgage?

Now my mom has asked me to sign mortgage documents a few times and I decline every time. I blindly signed last time, I’m not doing it again. And I don’t want them checking or affecting my credit in any way. This is for me to work out on my own. I also don’t believe I can help her anymore because I’m no longer co-signer material. But because my name is on the mortgage, my signature is needed for things.

She says she’s going to take my name of the mortgage thinking I’m going to care. I tell her to remove it then. She says it costs lawyer fees to do so. She’s also thinking of selling the house and moving. I’ve told her I don’t want any part of it and have mentioned that one day I’m going to move out, so I don’t want to be on her mortgage. This is actually true.

My mom is upset and keeps saying that I’m affecting the process. That I’m the reason selling the house will take longer (because my name has to be removed), that I’m just being difficult and making things harder for her, and I’m sure I’ll be blamed for her not being approved for a higher mortgage/better house in the future.

I feel like this is my life and my own finances to sort out. I didn’t know what signing those documents meant when I signed them, it was just my mom and of course I’m going to sign a few documents so she can get whatever. I almost called and reported fraud when I saw my credit report, and it affected my first vehicle finance (but that’s no longer a big deal).

I don’t feel obligated to help, I can’t EVEN help anymore, but she thinks I’m just doing it to screw her over and be difficult when I’m not. Though even with good credit - I still don’t want to! Yes, I pay rent!

111,"Business P&L shows small net loss due to owner's salary, bank saying none of the salary can be included - Help Me Mortgage Underwriters!","Hello - we are going through a mortgage refi and the bank is telling us that the income we receive from a business we own (sole proprietorship) cannot be counted as the business P&L is slightly negative AFTER drawing a salary.

For example:

Revenue: 100K

Expenses: 60K

Salary: 50K

Net Income: -10K

There must be something off, right? They are actually telling us the negative P&L from the business is factoring into our Debt-to-Income ratio at approx. - $833 / month (-10K / 12 months). In my mind, had we just taken less money out of the business it would have had a positive P&L, so this seems so arbitrary.

I'm not interested in either of those options but I'm curious if anybody has recommendations on how/where to get some helpful credit advice?

Pull out \~35K to pay for my masters vs (another) student loan

take \*up to\* 70k and put as a down payment on a second investment property.  
Lastly, take 6k to redo our backyard project (not a remodel)

I estimate needing $135-145k to accomplish this. 

I have no interest in selling the inherited home as it cash flows $1800/mo after property management fee. Rents for $2,050 and according to zillow (FWIW) is estimated at 480k.

I currently pay $900/mo on CC and loan debt and based on some calculators, the monthly cost to this endevor is a cheaper/mo while affording more 'cash' to accomplish my goals. 

Based on my estimated costs and desires mentioned above, what route should I go? Is this a smart idea? What other things should I be looking at? 

On the topic of the investment home, I am looking for something that ultimately 'cash flows' 4-500/mo, which in theory, pays for our 'investment'.

120,Removing a collection account from credit report,"In 2017 I was out of state on vacation and got sick, visited a local urgent care (in Alaska), received the care I needed, and was on my way. At the time I was a 21y/o college student still living with my parents and was on their health insurance, so all of my medical payments, paperwork, etc was handled by them. 

For the Alaska urgent care visit I owed a $170 bill, which was paid upon receipt (or so we thought). 

In 2018 get a call from a collections agency saying I still owe the $170. Supposedly they never received the original payment, so we take care of it and think it’s paid off again, but apparently it still wasn’t, which to this day I still don’t understand. 

In 2019 I get a call again saying I STILL owe this bill, I tell them it’s a mistake, that it’s been paid off twice to my knowledge and don’t think much of it. At this point I honestly thought that this phone call was a scam.

In May of 2019 I get another call telling me I owe $170, very frustrated at this point we attempt to make the payment again, and finally the collection account is marked as paid and closed.

Now, this measly $170 collection account is the only negative mark on my credit report that has exceptional payment history on a slew of student loans and and car payments.

What, if any, would be the best way to attempt to clean this off of my credit score? It was my, and my parents good faith belief that the bill was paid prior to it even being sent to a collections agency, then again our good faith belief that it was paid when we were first contacted by collections.

First time post, longtime lurker here. Just want to preface, I hope nothing I say is super tone-deaf or, on the other hand, super stupid. Just feel lost AF and could use some third-party advice that I'm not paying a therapist for :/ Really appreciate any advice <3 

I'm 23, M, based in NYC. I move here when I was 20 (graduated college early, because it was mentally fucking with me.)

I'm currently making around \~110K between full-time job and some side consulting (3-5 hrs / week). If I really wanted to, I could bring this up to $200K+ with more independent consulting....but....

I'm being mentally drained. I know I shouldn't be seeking out happiness through a career, but I feel mentally drained and I'm getting super depressed and I can barely keep up as is mentally. I've been drinking a lot more too....

I also know that I don't want to work for life and want to FIRE, but I also don't want to be scraping by at 30K / year.

I also have a bad immigrant child mentality. Everytime I spend money on clothes or any of my interests I instantly regret it and feel like awful. I REALLLLLLLLLLY want to buy art supplies and rent an art studio out  even though I suck at it (one of my longest standing passions but one that I gave up when I was like 14) but I just feel bad. It's the immigrant child mentality of seeing my parents struggle that hits me.

Idk, anyone else go through a similar experience (or not similar that could be helpful)?

\- 6 mos saved in monthly expenses

\- maxed out roth IRA

\- employer match 401k

\- invest additionally in taxable (mainly ETF & some long-term stocks) about 1K/mos

Tldr: Do I just suck it up and take the extra work to get me to \~200K and bank that money?

5% match kinda sucks, especially since they don’t match until two years in and not retroactive, and if I’m paying my income tax rate on it later, why not just invest privately and enjoy the perks of a flexible and self-managed portfolio of ETFs and the 15% long term tax rate.

This started when we moved into our house about 7 years ago.  My wife took care of putting the bills in our name.  I noticed on the quarterly water bill that automatic payment had been set up and thought great, one less thing to deal with.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I got a call from the water superintendent.  Apparently, the automatic payment was from the previous owner.  Yeah, It took them 7 years to notice they were paying for our water.  So, the town is paying them back, and now wants us to pay for the water we used.  Actually, they're only asking for the last 6 years, so that's nice.  Paying it back is not a problem, just how long we could take.  The water guy suggested a year or two.  However, in telling my dad about this he told me that typically when something like this happens (does stuff like this really happen that often?) a person has the same amount of time to pay back the debt.  I suggested this to the water guy and he wasn't sure that would fly.  I told him we'd think about this and get back to him.

137,Should I leverage my house and invest it for a down payment on our next house? (USA),"So my wife and I lucked out about five years ago into a great deal on a house in an absolutely red-hot housing market. It's a multi-family home and we rent the upstairs and live in the downstairs.

The house is quite small and since we bought it we've had a child. We know we want to upgrade to a larger home in the next five years but building up the down payment on a larger house in our area is daunting. What we want is going to be in the $300k range, so we're looking at around $60k for a down payment. 

Since we got such an insane deal on our house right now we owe only about 180k on a house that we could reasonably sell for $350k. We also pay our entire mortgage from the rental income to this house.

Should we refinance our mortgage and leverage the house (maybe get a $200-220k mortgage)? We could get our interest rate down a hair so we'd probably only raise our mortgage payment by a little bit, and we could make up by raising our rent a bit in the apartment (we currently rent a decent bit below market so we can have the power to be picky about renters). 

My thought would be to take that extra $~30k and invest it in something relatively safe and get a 6-7% growth on it for the next five or so years. It would get us quite a ways to a down payment on our next house, and we could then transition our current home to al all rental property to offset the second mortgage.

TL;DR - We have probably about $100-$150k USD equity in our home, which we rent part of. Should we leverage that home and invest the money to seed the down payment on our next home so we can turn our current home into a full rental property?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvj57h/should_i_leverage_my_house_and_invest_it_for_a/,1614629352.0,1,1,0

139,What is the Reason of Separation for an expired W2 Contract?,"Hi all

I'm trying to fill out unemployment after having a year long W2 contract expire recently. I'm having trouble trying to narrow down what to choose as my reason for separation, as none of them seem too accurate. The following are the options I have to choose from:

 

##### Lack of work:

You lost the job due to lack of work, reduction in force, downsizing, company shutdown, job elimination, company restructuring/reorganization, or lack of company funds/orders.

##### Quit:

You voluntarily left your job.

##### Discharged/Unable to Meet Standards:

You were discharged or fired because you were unable to meet employer performance or production standards, or you were unable to meet employer's qualifications for the job.

##### Discharged/Fired:

You were discharged or fired for a violation of company policy, such as absenteeism, theft, insubordination, drug or alcohol use or a criminal act.

##### Strike/Lockout:

You are unemployed because of a work stoppage conducted in violation of an existing collective bargaining agreement in the establishment in which you were employed. It is not necessary that you are actually participating in the strike, but only that you are not working because of the strike in the facility in which you worked.

141,Finding optimal strategy for current debt,"Hello everyone,

Long time lurker here and am interested in acquiring some advice on how to best handle my debt. 

After covid, i lost my engineering job and i returned back home to go to school for a second degree. Thanks to my tax refund. I can pay off all of my debt right now. However, i have some concerns. 

This is the breakdown of my current finances. I reduced most expenses to essentials. 

Total money: 6000

Debt: 4010

Income: 1060 a month

Bills: 

Rent: 0 

Car : 350

Food: 250

insurance: 120

Card bills total : 61

Gym: 50

Acorns: 150 ( invest and later: 15 x 4 )

I know that its ill advised to invest when their is high interest debt but i figured that when i can secure a new engineering position after graduating in a year and a half, perhaps sooner, i can eliminate that debt instantly and then start aggressively saving more so then I am now. I am 24 right now and am trying to take advantage of compounding interest early. 

Some people might also be asking why I just dont pay the debt off right now. I am basically trying to preempt potential large expenses. Covid has me mostly defensive in maintaining my savings. I am also trying to help my parents how i can. 

Any suggestions or concerns that i am not seeing?

Thanks in advance.

I recently finally paid off ny debt, but am now realizing that I need to make up a lot of ground in retirement savings  and wondering if you have some suggestions for how to catch up.

M/39/Single

I make about $91k ($79,000 salary plus about $12,000 in rental income). 

$45k in savings (about 10k of that is saved to buy car this year)
$20k in retirement
Own home, still owe about $195k, but have about $200k in equity.

The problem is I might change careers. If I leave soon, the pension would only be about 12K a year (and that would be out about 25 years). If I stay for entire career it could be around 60K.

148,$3000 short for closing on new home,"I'm closing on a home in a couple weeks and after looking at total cash on hand and not draining my accounts to $0, I'm looking at about $3000 short for what is due at closing.

This isn't a big deal as I can liquify some assets to reach that cash on hand, I was just wondering if there was a generally accepted method of doing so.

Option 1: Sell some of my company's stock to make up the difference.  Straightforward, but lose on potential future assets plus will have to pay taxes on it.

Option 2: Roth IRA rollover.  Take out necessary cash from Roth IRA, use it as cash on hand, and then repay that cash into the Roth IRA within 60 days.  The biggest negative is if I don't repay this amount within that timeframe, I will never be able to repay it due to maximum IRA contributions per year.

150,Dumb young adult needs credit advice.,"Okay, so I want to preface this by apologizing if these questions are dumb. I have no clue what I’m doing in terms of credit and I need things explained.
I should also say that I’m on SSI, so I know that I could make monthly payments as long as they’re not too much.

I haven’t had a credit card before. I was advised by my bank early last year that the best way to start building credit would be a line of credit for overdraft protection. Since opening that I’ve been overspending by around $100 every month and then just paying it off at the beginning of the next month. Now I’m not sure what the best next step would be for what I want to do.

Basically I want to buy some rather expensive music gear ($1500 ish) and I’d like to pay it off in payments, as obviously I cannot afford to buy it outright. 

From here I can see a couple options.

A) Apply for one of the payment plans through the store like Sweetwater, which requires a credit report 

B) Apply for an actual credit card through my bank and then use that to make the purchase and pay it off gradually.

The problem I’m running into is I don’t know if I’ve built enough credit through the overdraft protection to have either be feasible, and I’m not sure how to check that. 
 I don’t want to risk being rejected for either option , because that would make my credit worse and therefore I’d be even less likely to be approved in the future, right?
Same thing with checking my credit score? I assumed that would be the way to tell whether or not I’ve built up enough credit.

I have questions if I want to go with option B. I’m looking at the application currently and it’s asking for yearly income, rent amount and combined account balance. I typically pay rent in cash ($250)  so I don’t know if the bank would necessarily know that I in fact am paying rent. As in they wouldn’t see any transfer that says “rent” on my statement. I usually just pull around 5-600 out every month, pay my rent in cash and then use the remaining cash for food and gas. What’s left in my account usually ends up as my entertainment budget. So I would still put $250 on the application, right? And then maybe have my landlord call and verify I’m paying rent?
 And would it look better if I saved up so that I have a decent combined account balance when I apply, or should I just do so as is?
 
I’m sorry if I’m over thinking this and these questions are dumb, I just don’t want to be rejected and mess up my credit for the future.

154,Mortgage Refinance advice - leaning towards yes.,"Hello and thank you, 

Please excuse my lack of experience,  I am looking into a mortgage refinance and just wanted to be sure I was thinking correctly.  Below are the details I'm working with.

Current Mortgage
Payment 614.00  before escrow - 
Amount owed 89024.00 - 
Life of loan left 18yrs - 
Current rate 4.75% fixed - 
Refinanced 2 years ago - 
Value of Home 165,000 - 

Refinance options (mortgage broker) 
2.5% at 15yrs - 
          Or
3%   at  20yrs - 
Total closing costs  3130 (0.25 points/$235) - 
New loan amount 94,000 - 

I may be able to have closing costs reduced slightly from appraisal waiver.  

My thoughts are the 15yr lowers the payment very little but pays the loan off 3yrs sooner. 
The 20yr would lower the payment approx 100 per month but extend the loan 2 years. 

I'm leaning towards the 15yr, but one concern is since I refinanced 2yrs ago I'm guessing I didn't hit the break even point on those closing costs yet but with total interest saved if I stay the full term it should offset that and the new closing costs correct?

157,Bridge vs Re-Cast Home Loan,"Hello!  Working on selling my house and buying a new home.  We need more space and the current rates are hard to ignore. 

Here's my dilemma- I don't have the cashflow to put down on a house without selling my existing.  On top of that the housing market in my area is pretty hot and contingency offers aren't worth the paper they're sent in on.  


This leaves me with getting a bridge loan (still learning what this means) or re-casting a home loan with my existing mortgage company.  The problem with the re-cast is I would still need to come up with 5% to put down on the house, which is likely to be 10s of thousands of cashflow I just don't have.  This would lead me to do the unthinkable of pulling it from my 401k and incurring a 10% penalty plus income tax just to convert it to cash to put into my new home loan.   


The only advantage I can come up with on the re-cast is that you can lock in the current rate and Bridge loans generally have higher interest due to the short term nature of the loan.  I still haven't found ""the house"" yet, but my home is sell ready so if I do find it tomorrow my house can be up same week on the market.

I noticed this, and pointed it out to them. This was before the holidays. This is where things start going downhill real fast,

1. They take forever, but in mid Jan, they deposit the amounts, but don't withdraw incorrect amounts.
2. As a result, I am left with excess funds in my accounts. Concerned about this, since I can't invest till I get my balances straightened out, I call to point this out. An extremely rude employee tells me they have fixed the issue, and there is no excess in my account. I tell him, he is wrong, and should patch me through to someone else. He refuses. After arguing with him for 40+ mins, the phone line goes dead. I call up again, and tell someone, and they say they will make a note.
3. They goof up again, and although my balances are more inline with what they should be, now there is a $1000+ shortfall in the account. On top of this, when I sent this message, stating the roth/non-roth portions are still incorrect, they claim, there is an excess amount in my account.
4. I've tried contacting them multiple times making spreadsheets, tracking my every transaction and send it to them. All I hear back is, we've got the information you've sent us, an we're researching this. I can't get to talk to the person who is actually assigned my case.

169,HDHP/HSA vs PPO - Pregnancy,"We just started open enrollment with the new plan year starting April 1. Wife and I are expecting our first child in July, and are currently on a PPO. This has me really diving into the costs/benefits of each plan and hoping for some insight to validate my thought process - I'm relatively new to this whole insurance bit.

**PPO Option**

* Premium: $664/mo currently, $1,051/mo with incoming dependent
* Deductible (Ind/Fam): $2,500/$5,000
* Co-Insurance: 20% after deductible
* Max OOP (Ind/Fam): $6,500/$13,000

**HDHP/HSA Option**

* Premium: $433/mo currently, $651/mo with incoming dependent
* $1000 Employer Contribution towards HSA
* Deductible (Ind/Fam): $5,000/$10,000
* Co-Insurance: 0% after deductible
* Max OOP (Ind/Fam): $6,900/$13,800

&#x200B;

We don't have any HSA savings currently but I was thinking to put the difference in premiums (\~$4300) + what I'd put towards an FSA with the PPO option ($2750) towards the HSA instead but have it tax free.

170,Refinance Credit Card Debt or Balance Transfer,"Hello! You guys give great advice so I am here again.

Our biggest debt is $18k that was a medical debt on a care card. We pay $390 a month and only $46 goes to the balance. We have an additional $400 we could contribute making our potential payment around $800 per month. Some months, we can (and will) put more towards it, but the $800 is a pretty firm number. 

I am trying to decide if we leave it alone where it is at 21% interest, refinance it at around 8% fixed, or send some of it to a zero balance card. 

If we did the zero balance card, we are getting pre-approved for about $10-12k. We would have to use our emergency funds to pay that other $8k-6k down. This would leave us with 3 months of emergency savings in our bank account versus the 6 we have saved up now.  

If we refinanced, we would save $4k on interest, but we would not change the time factor. It would still take us about two years to pay it off. I am definitely motivated by time rather than long-term financial savings when it comes to debt. 

Are any of the two alternatives worth it? Should we keep it where it is now? Should I consider the zero balance despite not wanting to touch our emergency funds (the security of our jobs and my husband's car's longevity are a mixed bag right now)? Anything else I am not thinking of?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvgzdz/refinance_credit_card_debt_or_balance_transfer/,1614624510.0,1,1,0

173,Pet Insurance for older dog - is Pet Insurance Still a Scam?,"We have a 9 year old Goldendoodle. Great dog. My wife loves him. I love him (but not as much as my wife does). I am concerned that a vet is going to say he needs some crazy expensive surgery or some other procedure(s) in the future and was wondering if anyone can recommend a pet insurer? I looked into it when we first got the dog and every reliable source said to avoid it and that it's a scam.

Reason I'm asking is, prior to having this dog, we had another dog that was much older one evening in the middle of the night woke up screeching in pain. Emergency vet visit and they said he needed hip surgery with an estimate of $5k minimum cost. We paid the $800 emergency vet visit fee, had them sedate the dog until morning when we could see our regular vet who advised against the surgery due to the dog's age and recommended euthanasia, which we did. 

Honestly, if the something like that happens with this dog, I am not so sure my wife would agree to it and would drain our emergency fund to pay for it so before we have ""the talk"" about this I wanted to check on current recommendation for pet insurance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvgt0a/pet_insurance_for_older_dog_is_pet_insurance/,1614624083.0,0,0,0

I would like if possible to buy around novemberish. I won't have tons of money to put down and this is possibly where I might have issues. I'm thinking I could get together 5-10k on my own and possibly more if my parents or mother in law decide to throw money in but I don't know if they will at this current time. I have been thinking a USDA loan would be better because I won't have much to put down. I have looked and where I want to buy is rural and fits into the USDA criteria so that is no concern. I guess the first question I have would be am I being realistic here? Can I get a house with not much money down or am I dreaming? Another question I have is how does the whole thing work? do I get approved for lets say 200k then I go house hunting? Also what if I find a great house for cheap but it has no garage can I use the loan to buy the house and build a garage? And what about these mortgage calculators? how accurate are they and what can I do to ensure they will give me as accurate calculation as possible? I don't want to get in over my head with the payment. And lastly I will have paid my credit cards off but should I put my current utilities on them and pay them right off to build some more credit?

179,"My wife's grandmother wants to give our newborn $1,000 but she's insisting we have to open the account at her local bank some 2,000+ miles away","We just had our first child (yay!) and my wife's grandma wants to give her first great-grandchild $1,000. She's intimated that she may want to give him more money in the future so she's insisting that whatever account we open be through her local community bank [(this one, if it makes a difference)](https://www.firstinterstatebank.com). 

We've already opened a 529 plan through a low-cost provider but I'm assuming we can't convince her to deposit money in that account. It sounds like she's got a ""special relationship"" with a ""nice young man"" at her local branch so we need to call him to discuss this. I hope that isn't an invitation to a sales pitch for expensive insurance product(s) but we'll see. 

In any event, I never thought I'd be in the position of opening an investment account through a local bank so I have some questions. 

* Can we buy a 529 plan from any state from a small bank? Or will most banks only sell a limited selection of 529 plans (maybe just the plan for the state in which the bank resides)?
* Will this bank tack on fees to open a 529 plan through them? If so, will they be upfront fees or baked into the investment options?
* Can we have multiple 529 plans for the same beneficiary? 
* Down the road, can we transfer the money from this 529 to our 'real' 529 plan without penalty?
* Are there any other types of account we should be considering? Sticking the money in savings would be a waste and I understand you need earned income for a Roth IRA - so is a 529 the best and only choice for an account type?

I'm so conditioned to think ""do not buy investment products through a bank"" that I'm going into this expecting to get nickel and dimed and pitched garbage products. Maybe it's not so bad though. I hate to see grandma waste her money by investing it in a less efficient manner - so how bad is getting a 529 through a brick and mortar place?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvghze/my_wifes_grandmother_wants_to_give_our_newborn/,1614623379.0,0,0,0

181,Refinancing math,"Looking at refinancing Girlfriend’s home loan and wanted to see if the numbers made sense to do it. Would have refinanced earlier when rates were better, but she just started a new job after being off work for medical reasons. Numbers are approximate but close enough for comparison purposes. House is worth probably $400,000 now, wouldn’t mind moving but realistically with housing prices in the area wouldn’t probably move for a while. I wouldn’t be added to the loan as it does not help with rates.

Currently $155,000 30-year loan at 4.375% APR total interest charged for life of loan $123,600. Started Feb 2014, paid on it for 7 years, current balance is $133,000, payment before taxes and insurance is ~$775/month. Have paid $44,500 in interest, interest left on life of loan $79,000. Pay off date Feb 2044

Refinance loan amount for $133,000 + $5000-7000(costs to refinance still shopping so using worst case) at 3.25% APR for 30-year loan. Payment on $140,000 would be $610 per month saving $165 a month, total interest charged would be $80,000 so basically the same if kept on current loan. Payoff date April 2051.

If applied, the extra $165 a month to loan would drop total interest to $52,500 savings of $27,500 in interest over the life of the loan and would be paid off by Jan 2042. To recoup the $7000 to refinance would take ~3.5 years to break even.

Just trying to figure out if it makes sense numbers wise. Looks like worst case its basically a wash if we don’t add extra payments but if we do we would save ~$27,500 over the life of the loan, and as long as we stay there for more than 4 years it makes sense.

188,Which of the 3 options sounds the most financially responsible?,"Before I list the options out, I just want to mention that I work from home and rarely would be using a vehicle as most of my hobbies outside of work can be done from home. If I purchase the home, I'd have a nice freezer to store things in and be able to buy a good portion of items in bulk to save money and the amount of trips to the grocery store needed would be maybe twice or 3 times per month.

Assume I make about $40k per year at the moment and am a 25 year old single dude with zero debt and no major responsibilities. I have enough to take out an FHA loan on the house. My income allows me to get up to $230k but I dont want to buy more house than I should so I'd comfortably stick to something around $100-150k. Most houses I found for around that range in my area (mind you it's a sellers market right now where I'm at) looked great. So now for the options:

\- Option A: Buy a house that's well within my budget. Most nice 2-3 bedroom homes in my city are between $100-$130k for a decent one. I have a friend who would be renting one room from me so he'd be helping me with a portion of the mortgage (house hacking for the win). This option would include me buying a fairly cheap vehicle so that I can get to and from the grocery store. Something around $2-5k. I have no ego attachment to the car I drive so generally I couldn't care less as long as it gets me to my financial goals quicker. I will eventually upgrade the car to something nicer once my finances permit me to. I drove a beat up 2003 nissan altima that I got for $800 for over 2 years before I sold it to move to a new city so I really don't care haha.

\- Option B: Hold off on buying a house and instead take out a loan for a car within $10-12k to get a nicer car but then be stuck renting because I wouldn't be able to get a loan for a house (at least not right away). I really want to have my own place because it just seems like there are so many nice pros to owning your property that you don't get with renting. Obviously there are cons as well that I'm more than willing to take on like repairs your own home requires that are generally not your responsibility when you rent or having to do your own yard work (honestly that's a pro to me because I love doing the outdoor work).

\- Option C: Hold off on both and just save and suffer. I'm currently renting a room from a friend for pretty cheap and don't have a vehicle to get anywhere so I feel really stuck but I'm having trouble deciding with A or B.

190,How do car dealerships even make money off 0% interest financing? What do they have to gain from this?,"This doesn't make sense. A car is 20k, and the idea of financing is that you don't have 20k in hand right now, so you finance with like 4k down and take out a 16k loan at like 5% or something, so you're paying the 16k principal down over 4-6 years and are paying interest on that so the car dealership benefits. So you're paying them like 25k in the end or something because of all the interest accrual. Ok, that makes sense, I know how the dealership makes money off that.

But what if the interest is 0? Then you pay exactly 16k over 4-6 years, and not a penny more, to the dealership, and they get the same amount of money as a cash purchase would get them, except they need to wait several years to get it all? What is the point of that? What does the dealership have to gain from this? Nothing. So what, are they just letting you do this out of the goodness of their heart?

199,Fidelity says I'll be FIRE at 43... Is it true?,"The Fidelity FIRE calculator says I'll be fire in 17 years, which puts me at 43. I want to retire early for sure, but how good is this calculator?


Little background info:

I'm almost 26, husband is 24.

He makes $105k, and gets about a 10% bonus each year.
I made $63k, and I also get about a 10% bonus each year. We both get about 3% raises each year.

He contributes 6% and gets 6% 401k from employer.
I contribute 7% and get 4% for 401k from employer.

We max out our Roth IRA each year (husband has been doing it since he was in high school, but I just started doing it this year).

We just recently bumped up our HSA contribution to the max of $7100 ($5600 from me, $1500 from employer). It currently only has $2k in it.


We have $36k in a high yield savings account
We have $60k total in our 401K
We have $66k total in our Roth IRAs
We have $35k invested in mutual funds

We bought a house last year, we have about $120k equity (it's worth about $600k now).

Our monthly expenses (including paying 1/12 extra mortgage payment each month) are approximately $5000. Some months are $6000 or $7000. It just depends. Buying a house is expensive!!

I've been trying to save about $700 a week into the savings account, but with the new changes to HSA, it's probably closer to $600 a week. But there was a period where we didn't save anything for a few weeks because of various large purchases that gave us hefty credit card bills. Since we have a 6 month emergency fund established and max out retirement/HSA, savings are just bonus.

We don't have a car payment, but we will be in the market for one (Toyota Rav4 or similar) in the next 2 or 3 years). No student loans or credit card debt.

Granted I know it takes a lot of work and monitoring to be profitable out of the stock market. My explosive gains in crypto tempts me to put more money into it once it dips, but it did take me 3.5 years to see myself out of the red and there's still so much uncertainty with digital coins (honestly I just held that long since it would've cost me more to file extra forms on turbo Tax than the actual losses that I would have incurred at the time, thankfully my being cheap turned out to be a good move).

At that point I'll also have about $6500 on a credit card I no longer use. I'm a little clueless on how the interest of this card works but I pay about $250 a month and interest eats $100 of that at this point, with a current balance of $7400.

Obviously the interest on my cc is killing me. But if I put that $150 towards my car I should pay it off 6 months sooner and will be able to put the extra $150 + my $200 car payment towards my credit card.

206,"Turning 30, no real understanding of best credit practices and where to start with growing wealth.","Howdy all, 

I’m turning 30 this year and realizing that I’ve never paid much attention to my credit or general wealth. I have always maintained my finances well (always have ~10k in savings and enough in my debit account to handle expenses while continuing to save), but I don’t know how to grow my wealth and credit effectively. I’ve always squirreled away cash and only ever have bought things that I could afford outright. 

I’ve never had a credit card or felt it was necessary, but I’m realizing that my credit score is kind of sub-par (690-710). I’d like to get better credit because I’ll likely be buying a house in the next 5 years or so. Is it best to get a credit card to do this or are there ways where I can grow credit through continuing my current life practices (like buying things outright without financing)?

Also, I know my money is just sitting there depreciating in my savings and I’ve looked a little into Roth IRA’s. I’m a little scared of sealing cash away in an account like that, are there alternatives that are less risky to have my savings not lose value? What questions/rules should I have for starting savings accounts for growing my wealth?

210,New construction property tax question,"Hi all, just looking for a bit of clarification here (cross posted in r/realestate too).

My wife and I are in the process of building a new home (\~$550k, putting about $60k down). While working with the lender, they mentioned that they estimate the property taxes much higher until the real rate is established (they are estimating 1.2% in their calculations, average rate here in CO is about .6%). They do this so people are not caught off guard with a steep increase in year 2 and default. 

So, here is my question. If they are estimating 1.2% and collecting that at closing for year 1, what happens year 2? I assume I will get some year 1 money back via a return once the actual rate is established (correct me if I'm wrong here). 

However, will my monthly payments also go down in year 2 (or whenever the real rate comes into play? For example; if my monthly payment in year 1, when using 1.2%, is $3k/month. Will my monthly payment drop to \~$2700 in year 2 once the real rate of .6 goes into effect?

211,"House purchase, terrified, am I making the wrong decision?","The real estate market is very hot where I live and it seems lots of places. 

I am single without debt or kids, I make 72k, credit is in 800s, liquid savings of 67k, retirement account of 90k. 

The list price on this 3 bed 1 bath was 220k. It had 5 offers. 

I offered 228k, with a 6.5k appraisal guarantee, plus 2k in sellers costs. I am putting 10% down. 

This puts me out of pocket roughly 37k up front. Plus it needs a washer drier for another 1.5k let’s say. Otherwise it is move in ready. 

Leaving me with a mortgage of 205,213.

My offer won. I am now questioning if I made the wrong decision. I have an inspection contingency and the inspection is Wednesday. 
If I were to leave this house in 5 years, would I be out a lot of money?

I don’t anticipate a 1 bath single family detached in this particular area to appreciate a lot from its current level. I think my best case scenario in 5 years is it holds its value. 

If it did, and hypothetically say I want to move in 5 years, Dave Ramsey says selling a house typically costs 15% of the sale price (factoring 6% in realtor commissions and about 9% repair/maintenance costs over the years which I understand may vary) I know in 5 years it will need a new heating and cooling unit which I anticipate to be 4K. Carpets eventually need replacing as will flooring, paint, and possibly kitchen cabinets. Plus the unknowns. 

So my sales costs would be about 33.75k in 5 years and at that point I would have about 182k in principal on the mortgage left based on amortization schedules. 

Say it sells for 225k again minus costs of 33.75k with 182k owed, that leaves me with about a 9k gain (225k minus 33.75k minus 182k)
 
I am shelling out 37,000 up front on a home I will likely only recoup 9k on if I sold in 5 years. And will have paid a TON of transaction fees, and when I sell it may be a buyers market where I pay their costs AGAIN. 

I have a stable job and am single, no intentions of starting a family in the near future but it’s a hope one day. 

In order for me to break even on the house, it seems I’ll need to be there for much longer than 5 years and cross my fingers the real estate market doesn’t crash horrendously?
Bad or good decision? Any factors I’m missing?

We have 200K in high yield savings which is kinda a joke nowadays. 100K in stocks.

221,Roth IRA or other smart vehicles when still in College/pre-employment?,"Hello everyone! I am trying to find out if opening a Roth IRA makes sense while I'm still in school/ do not have full-time employment yet. About me:

* 21 yrs old, Finishing my undergrad engineering degree this year - pursuing masters next year
* Very fortunate to have a full scholarship and whatever's not covered is being paid for by my parent's college fund. ie, nearly no expenses from now until I graduate grad school.
* I have \~$20,000 in an amex saving account, \~$10,000 in value in a Robinhood account, \~$2000 in my checking, and \~$3000 in a Schwab brokerage account I just learned about  (Was gifted my a relative when I was younger.)
* I have earned $6-12k per summer due to corporate internships (taxable income)
* When I graduate I expect my salary to be between 90-100k.

I have read the Roth IRA wiki, but am wondering if there is any downsides into opening one before I have full-time employment and know what my options are there as well? Is it safe to assume I will just optimize my employer offerings and still contribute to my Roth IRA? I plan on saving much more than just whatever 401k/etc match they give me, so I would plan to use the Roth IRA as my vehicle for that. Part of my motivation is also me feeling stupid for leaving so much just sitting in a savings account right now...

I was called by my uncle(a fire chief)who is very well off and has been saving since he was 16 and has a lot of money, and he told me to start a Roth IRA and start putting money away into it. I have been thinking about starting one but this was the push that sent the wheel into motion. 

He told me his fire fighting friend in the town over would get me set up. I scheduled a call with him over zoom last week and the meeting soon turned into a “presentation” about their company and how I could also make money doing it and some red flags immediately went off in my head. I didnt think a bank would have to sell you to start a Roth IRA with them, just thought it would be something they would assist you in but it seemed like more of a sales pitch and about how reputable their company is. He also pushed hard on me to get life insurance and I have since looked up Primerica and it seems it is a MLM business. 

Also throughout the meeting it became apparent this guy that I set my account up with would be managing my funds. I trade stocks on my free time and do alright for myself, have turned 20k into 36k in 9 months mainly on swing trades and some day trades both based on upcoming catalysts and market trends and I would have thought my account would’ve been managed by someone more knowledgeable about the market than a firefighter who has been doing it 10 years who called it his “side hustle”.

228,Grandma Needs to Downsize,"Grandma needs to downsize. She has poor credit and she has some savings but it's not overly substantial other than the equity in her paid off home ($180k-ish value). The home was the last thing her and my Grandpa ever borrowed for and it was PIF circa 1970s. She's in a LOCL area, I can get her a smaller home for $100k-ish. My inclination is to take out the mortgage myself to get her moved because it needs to happen pretty quickly and her home won't sell very fast so contingent offer is not really an option. I can easily afford the down payment and mortgage payments, but dropping $100k outright does not appeal to me. 

&#x200B;

When her house sells it's possible she pays off the new house with a portion of that equity. I'm her sole heir so estate issues are not a concern. I'm mostly thinking of tax implications or whether there might be better options. 

&#x200B;

I'm not sure I could get her to cash out refinance her current house to buy something else. Like I said, poor (not exactly bad) credit. She's old school when it comes to money. It took a while to get the money jar into an actual bank account when the sum became a concerning amount for her to have in the house.

I landed a great job last year and have been able to save up some cash. Additionally, tax season is here. Not to mention... I quit drinking - which is $450 extra in my account every month (yes, I was spending a lot on this vice). 

My current vehicle is reliable enough. I put a lot of miles on it and have driven it out of state on long road trips. But the AC is starting to go out, the fender was busted by a deer, and I believe a motor support is broken, not to mention some indicators and electrical issues.

In my area you can buy almost any used car from $1000-$5000, on average. Most need ‘a little work’ - but I’m no mechanic and I don’t want to sink money. Always a chance something serious will be wrong with the car. 

I’m here to ask about car dealerships. All of my cars have been used cars bought from your average joe. My family has never bought a car from a dealership. We have only ever bought cars that are paid off. Literally never made car payments. We pay full price, then make insurance payments, that’s it. 

I want to look at cars at dealerships because I feel like there’s much less chance something is going to be wrong with them. But what’s a good monthly payment to look for?

I currently only pay a phone bill and car insurance. I make $15/hr. I probably spend less than $70 a week to feed myself, and that’s being generous.

235,Help me understand this Excel formula for predicting future value,"I'm trying to understand how inflation adjusted growth calculators work.

I found a nice Excel sheet here on Lyn Alden's website:

[https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/Alden\_Wealth\_Calculator.xlsx](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/Alden_Wealth_Calculator.xlsx)

My question is referencing this spreadsheet specifically.

So there are two columns, ""Portfolio Value"" and ""Portfolio Value Inflation Adjusted""

I'm confused about the formula for the ""Portfolio Value"" column. It starts with the initial investment and then adds the annual contribution multiplied by the expected rate of return. So far so good. But then it seems to be adding in the contribution multiplied by the inflation rate, several times.. I'm confused about this.

In this spreadsheet example, a $95k starting value, with $30k added each year for 30 years produces a future portfolio value of $4.2MIL.

But if I use the FV() function in Excel, it produces a result of $3.8MIL.

I would think that to adjust for inflation in Excel's ""Future Value"" function, you'd just subtract the expected inflation rate (say, 2%) from the expected rate of return(say 7%).

So I'm hoping somebody can show me the reasoning behind the formula in the C column of this spreadsheet, why it seems like it's adding extra contributions based on the rate of inflation.

I couldn't seem to attach a screenshot to this post, but in case you don't want to download the file, if C8 is the starting amount, C9 is the expected rate of return, C10 is the annual contribution, and C12 is the inflation rate, the formula in question for future value at year 5 is this and I'm wondering why all those additions of ""new money added times inflation rate to the 5th, 4th, 3rd, etc...

*=$C$8\*(1+$C$9)\^5+$C$10\*(1+$C$12)\^4+$C$10\*(1+$C$12)\^3\*(1+$C$9)\^1+$C$10\*(1+$C$12)\^2\*(1+$C$9)\^2+$C$10\*(1+$C$12)\^1\*(1+$C$9)\^3+$C$10\*(1+$C$12)\^0\*(1+$C$9)\^4*

236,Should I sign a lease so I can have some more official renter's history?,"Hi all,

Here's my situation:

I'm in my mid to late 20s with not so much rental history (I've only signed one month to month lease directly through the landlord). Other rental history is from time outside the USA. I'm an evacuated Peace Corps volunteer and I plan on returning, but we most likely won't return until 2022. However, there's that slim chance we could go back earlier depending on how vaccines impact the pandemic.

I want to sign a lease through December. In this lease there is no early termination allowed without consent of landlord, and there is no subletting without consent of the landlord. Obviously I'm taking a bit of a risk (albeit a low one honestly) if I sign on. What if I have to leave earlier than December? There's no guarantee of consent from a landlord to let me find a new tenant clearly.

My roommate has said I don't need to sign the lease but for understandable reasons wants me to if I can and then I would also have a more equal voice in household manners.

If I absolutely had to, I would be prepared to pay out at least 6 months of rent, but for obvious reasons I wouldn't desire that outcome lol.

My question is, given this situation and my lack of rental history, is it worth it to sign on to this to get some history under my belt? I'm thinking I'd probably be doing future me a favor if I got some history. Anyway, I'm young and need some input from non-biased parties.

239,Should I help cancel my mom's life insurance policy?,"Hi all, I'm a relatively young guy so I don't really know how life insurance works. For the most part I see it as something I should get when I am older. I'd like your thoughts on my situation.

TL;DR

\- Mother is on welfare

\- Can not have more than $2000 in cash \[in the bank\]

\- Has paid $1500 yearly for three years so far for the policy

\- Policy is for $100,000 or $1m. Unsure

\- Has $800,000 in retirement investments from a divorce

&#x200B;

Hi all, I'm trying to understand if my mother should be paying for life insurance. She has three kids \[including me\] and when she dies her retirement investments will be split up between us. With the current value, we expect around $250k each. Assuming the market goes up on average and my mother does not pass away for another 10-20 years, that number can easily go up to $400k.

Currently, my mother is paying $1500 per year for life insurance. I'm trying to understand the policy but my current understanding is that either it will pay out $100,000 per year for ten years. Or it will be a lump sum of $100,000. The policy is written so that my youngest sibling \[18 years old\] will be able to take care of himself should my mom pass soon. Her goal is to make sure he can afford college and basic necessities until he gets a job after college.

From what I read, the policy is for $100k. It does not make sense to me that she pays $1500 a year for such a small policy. But even more importantly, if her goal is to take care of her children, her retirement investments should be more than enough to take care of us. From my perspective, there is no need to have life insurance.

What concerns me though is that I heard if you cancel your life insurance, you get some of the money back but two problems. 1) It becomes a taxable event, 2) My mother would have to liquidate some investments which would put her over $2000 in assets and she would lose access to affordable health insurance.

You may be wondering why she still qualifies for welfare even though she has a retirement account. There is a provision in state law that allows assets from divorces to not count. She also does not have a job.

I'm not sure where to go from here. I want my mom to still have access to affordable health insurance, I'd like to leave her assets/investments alone, I want my brother to be taken care of, and I don't want her to pay for life insurance she doesn't need. There's a lot to balance and it's not clear on what path will work best.

250,Leased Truck - How to Trade/Sell Early (+Bankruptcy on file),"Hello,

I signed a 3 year lease for a 2019 Ram 1500 at the end of April 2019. My car at the time was on its last legs and my career was on the up and up,  however, I was also in the process of filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy due to some really poor financial decisions and medical issues in my earlier 20’s. 

(I know, I know: why lease a brand new truck while filing for bankruptcy?) Not the most frugal of choices, but I needed a vehicle and was confident in my ability to afford it. And I can! However, being that I put no money down, the lease payment is quite high, as well as the insurance. 

Since covid, I have been working from home and hardly drive the truck 1-2x a week. The lease payment and insurance seems super unnecessary in light of this new situation, so, I’m wondering what the best options are in terms of selling/trading? 

With my Chapter 7 discharge occurring 8/2019, I COULD just turn the vehicle in with no further payment obligations. However, obviously with a bankruptcy on file and low credit score, this option would make it difficult to obtain another vehicle. Since I’ve still got a year on the lease and am under 50% of the mile allotment, I feel as though I should have equity on the lease. How would I go about obtaining a check that I’d be able to put towards another vehicle? Sell it? Trade it back in at the same dealer?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvc96j/leased_truck_how_to_tradesell_early_bankruptcy_on/,1614613181.0,1,1,0

252,Take out car loan to invest?,"Our car is paid in full, but the credit union just started a 1.99% auto loan promotion. My question is: should I take out a six-year $20,000 loan on my 2018 vehicle and invest in a Total Stock Mutual Fund (like VTSAX) for the duration?

I would probably drawn down as monthly payments are made.

VTSAX has returned 7% annually over the last 20 years.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I read the fine print and this is only for 24-month loans. The six-year rate is 2.75%. Here's my math:

$20,000 @ 2.75% for six years == $300 monthly payments.  
$20,000 @ 7% return in VTSAX == $3,300 left in the account after loan is paid off.

Conclusion: It would be a fun experiment, but making $500/year in interest is cool, but not quite worth the risk for me.

For some background, I grew up in a family where money was never something that was worried about (not in a bad way, just we had what we needed) and my parents were financially literate and help set me up with bank accounts, savings etc. at an early age. I'm currently 24, an artist and even though I don't have debt and have a healthy amount of money in savings, CDs, IRA, 401k etc., I have this feeling that if I don't reach a certain income amount after taxes (it changes each month), everything is going to come crashing down around me. I don't know where this feeling of lack or scarcity is coming from (I'm looking into therapy for it)  but it causes major anxiety every now and again. I was wondering if anyone had any ways they've reframed their thinking about money? It's gotten to where I can save anywhere between $1000-$1500 a month, which I know is fortunate, but I just don't know why I feel like that's 'not enough.' I hope this post doesn't come off the wrong way, and would love some guidance as to what I could be doing with my savings since 'just saving it' is really arbitrary to me.

1.Fill all information. Click on continue - Access locked. Call this 800 number.

Called the number. Entrer all information by touch phone. CSR with barely understandable heavy accent doesn't know what access I'm talking about. Transfered me to new account department
Again entering the same information by phone. After several minutes on hold another CSR. Yes, they can open new account for me. No, they don't know about any promotion. Back to square 1.

2. Now I've noticed that next to large ""Apply now"" the is tiny text, that said ""your home zip code is xxxxx"", which is not my zip code. My provider is ATT, and it's zip code of ATT HQ. How come in 2021 any web site can find my location by IP address, but Citibank can't? But I digress.

3. Changed ZIP to mine - hurray! Enter information online, created accounts. It's time to set online access to accounts.

4. Received emails about new accounts. Only last 4 digits of acoount number shown, and for online access I need full account number. Another 800 number, another hold.
No, they can't tell me account number. Call another number for new accounts.

5. After another hold - no, you have to call number for new account. And CSR gave me the same number. But i'm already calling it! OK, transfering...

6. Finally, new accounts department. Verifiyng all my infornation again - SDN, DOB, secret words. No, they can't tell me full acoount number, nor send by text or email. It's for your own security, sir! You have to wait for welcome package, that will be send by mail in 10 days.

We haven't purchased a home yet because we haven't lived long enough in one place for it to have made sense. 1 year here, 3 years there, another 1 year over here. 

But we have saved up a significant downpayment (or potential cash purchase depending on the market) for a home, however, I've come to learn about a ""physician loan.""

We qualify for these thanks to my wife's degree. It allows us to borrow at jumbo loan rates with only 5% (sometimes zero 0%) down and with no PMI.

Depending on where we move to after my wife's residency, making monthly payments on a 0% down loan shouldn't be an issue.

So are we better off putting as much down on the home as possible, or taking advantage of the doctor loan and putting our money to work over a 15-30 year period?

But my question is for someone who doesn’t really know what to invest in and who’s 401k or primarily just target funds atm is there really any benefit to the IRA until I learn more?

If she kept this money in the pension and didn't touch anything (since we're moving) it would pay her $1,300/month in 2050. The plan DOES NOT adjust for inflation. 

I calculated her expected benefit of $1,300/month, eroded by an average 2% inflation, would equal about $790 in today's money.

Likewise, if we pulled the cash value out and invested it at an average return of 6%, the $65,000 would be worth about $368,000 in 2050.

So, a few days after the interview, I get a call from one of the interviewers saying they want to hire me. I say I'm interested, but I forgot to ask during the interview about the schedule and pay rate (in my field the schedule is pretty standard so I wasn't too concerned it'd be different than I had assumed, and I had already seen the pay rate online).

I get an email from the company saying congrats on the position, and they set me up to do background and fingerprinting stuff in a few weeks. BUT I have not got an official offer letter yet including hourly rate.

A few years before retirement why wouldn't this person rollover this account to an IRA and then do a backdoor Roth conversion. perhaps doing this over the course of a few years to minimize taxes paid. they would have what amounts to the same amount of money after taxes but have an income of $0 in retirement. with $0 income they get no social security taxes and cheap Medicare and possibly qualify for other programs. or am I missing something.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lvanni/401k_social_security_question/,1614609177.0,0,0,0

269,90k in private & federal undergrad student loans. Trying to set up a strategy before I graduate.,"As the title suggests, I will be graduating undergrad with about 90k in debt. (Yes, I know this was not a wise financial decision.) I would just like to bounce my plan ahead of graduation off of some of you here to see if it’s feasible. Here’s some background: 

I went to a in-state to flagship university and while my grades were good I did not qualify for academic scholarships. As for need based, my family made far too much money to qualify anything more than the minimum federal loans. My loans upon graduation will be about 70k in private (at about 7.5% avg interest rate) and 20k in federal direct.

I will graduate with a degree in Political Science, minor in Econ, and a certificate in Professional Writing (tailored to public service) December of 2021. I have work experience as a campaign and retail employee (I worked most of my time through college) and am currently doing an internship. Although with the economy as it is my employment prospects after grad are uncertain as of now. 

I plan on putting my federal loans into IBR and focusing on knocking down my private loans asap. Upon graduation my payments will be about 800 per month for a 10 year period. I want to refinance those down to a lower monthly payment over a longer period to give myself some breathing room as I start my career, then start paying way over the minimum as soon as I can. I would be bringing on my dad as a cosigner here because while my starting salary is likely not going to be very high (lets say somewhere around 30k-40k), he makes about 140-170k per year depending on bonuses and has a good credit score. 
He had expressed willingness to help me with payments but after a very messy divorce with my mom (which, of course, was finalized just as I finish my schooling) he is waffling so I want to get into the mindset of taking on this beast myself. 
There’s a fair amount of room for growth in my field, *especially* if I went to grad school, however with this debt burden I don’t see how I would get there without being sponsored by an employer, or winning the lottery. 

So that’s about it. I’ve been trying to psych myself up and tell myself everything will be okay but given the large amount of uncertainty in my future I am almost nauseous on the daily. If anyone has any add-on’s or suggestions for this strategy I’d love to hear. Or if you’re in a similar situation to me, how you’re handling it.

I make $55k a year from my regular job and run a photography business on the side with an irregular stream of income (so I don't factor this into my monthly income -- its also not profitable at the moment anyways due to COVID restricting my ability to shoot). 

I currently have about $17k left in student loan debt (but not currently paying due), three credit cards, one with $6,000, one with $7,000, and one with $11,000; all of which are very close to being maxed out. The credit cards range in about 16%APR (11k) to 26% APR (7k)

I've reanalyzed my budgets and have at least got it to the point I'm not adding anything to the debt each month, but still not paying anything off due to only being able to make minimum payments.

279,EV State Tax Credit Query 1099-G,"I have tried to google around and search this issue and I'm having a hard time finding a clear answer. I have only lived in the USA / CO for 5 years and up until now I always just had a standard deduction on my taxes. This year I am once again back on the standard deduction. Last year was very different though, I had large credits for my Tesla and Solar, most of which was Federal but it included a $5k credit for Tesla purchased in 2019.

This year as tax season approached I received a 1099-G in the mail that stated this ~$5600 refund, $5k of which would be the Tesla.

I got to the part of my FreeTaxUSA tax return that indicates the 1099-G and answer accurately on the check boxes. From what I'm reading though, it seems like this $5000 from my Colorado refund is now taxable? I'm left with this box that just says ""Put in the amount of your state refund that is taxable"". If I throw in the amount on the 1099-G, it takes a good 1k or so off my refund. The other option seems to be just leaving it at zero and it has no impact.

Long story short, is this refund/credit from my Tesla on state taxes (CO) actually taxable on the next year's federal income tax?

280,"How to ""legitimize"" a rental? Ohio, USA","Long story short, while in college, 10 years ago, I bought a house for me and my friends to live in, they paid me some rent off/on and it worked great. 6 years ago I got married, moved in to a new house with my wife and have kept renting out the house to my friends. Mainly because I would keep rent low for them and know they're going to keep the house in good shape. A win/win. 

Each month they pay me enough to cover the mortgage with a little extra that I just put into another account that's just there to cover expenses for the house itself (for instance, the house recently needed a new roof, so I used that money for a roof). I haven't ever spent any of the money they've given me, just keeping it in that extra account, but I understand I've ""made"" money in that they're paying off the mortgage. I never really set out to make money off a rental, just trying to help some friends out by not charging them an arm and a leg because I got a house when prices were super low (2010). 

I tried searching this sub for something like this and couldn't find anything, and maybe this is the wrong sub to ask this question in. If there's a better sub for it just let me know and I'll go there! Thanks!!  

Edit: Thanks for all the help everyone. I wrongly assumed since any money I was getting I wasn't using that it wasn't income and that I'd have to just pay extra tax if/when I ever went to sell the house. This was obviously wrong.

281,How to get back on track (44F),"For over 10 years, I was in the throes of alcoholism and made very poor financial decisions. My credit score has always been >800, but I didn’t save anything and sort of ruined my career. I’m single with no debt and have been sober for awhile now.

Here’s my financial situation:

Salary: $75,000 (If I’d not put alcohol ahead of work, I’d be making >$120,000. Unfortunately, I lost something that’s essential to moving up in my career—being intentionally vague—so I’ve limited my earning potential, especially at my age.)

Rent: $1,200/month 

401K/403B: ~$250,000 (15% contribution right now)

Savings: $60,000

Knowing that I will likely never make more than $85,000, what should I do next? I live in a pretty high COL area, and my rent is very inexpensive due to me living in the same place for >10 years. The median house lists for about $450,000 in my area, but they typically sell for at east $100,000 more. Plus, I don’t think I want the responsibility of owning a home.

285,Advice on LTV / Mortgages (UK),"Hi all - I've got a quick question about mortgages below.

I am a first time buyer, looking to buy a property through a private sale on which I've had an offer accepted. 

House value \~£260-£280k  
Purchase price £240k

I'd need a mortgage of around £230k to be able to complete the purchase of this property. 

If I run my details through an online calculator, it estimates that I would be able to secure a mortgage of \~£195k. This leaves me with a considerable 35k gap to reach what I might need to borrow.

From my understanding the LTV ratio is calculated based on the value of the property, not the purchase price. If the value of the house is \~£270k let's say and I'm after a £230k mortgage - this would equate to roughly a 85% LTV ratio?

I was wondering if it would be possible to leverage this value in the house with the bank to secure a higher mortgage? Has anyone got any previous experience of this?

Struggling to find much info anywhere so far as obviously most people purchase houses at their value!

It's probably obvious but since I'm on a 30 year mortgage, the first 4 years have primarily been interest - a lot of interest. I know I should consider the drop in interest % (3/4-1% from 3.75% to either 3/2.75%) as well as closing costs, fees, lender discounts, etc. I've collected a few quotes and have been shopping them against each other to get a better deal. I've also been using Nerdwallet's refinance calculator to check my breakeven point, which according to them is 1-2 years and I plan to live here at least another 3-5 years, if not longer.

But here lies my question and makes my brain hurt: does any of this (esp. Nerdwallet's refi calculator) factor in the past 4 year's worth of interest I've paid? My principle has gone down by about 7% (and I've paid approx double that in interest) but I'm likely looking to refi back to a 30 year (unless there's a 26 year one? I've only seen 20-year, 15-year, etc.) and the 4 year's worth of interest is significant. AFAIK if it were taken into account, the breakeven point would be pushed way further out. Am I missing something here? Or would the amount of interest saved along with the lower monthly payment at the lower rate negate that?

291,I need help with creating a blueprint/budgeting plan to raise my terrible credit score. 23 years old with little to no clue on what to do.,"Hey all. I’m feeling super overwhelmed/lost. I just logged into credit karma for the first time in awhile. I have 3 bills in collection I didn’t even know about/never received notice for. Two are for radiology bills and one is for a nephrologist. 

My Transunion score is 516 and includes all 3 bills. My equifax is 546 and only includes the $86 nephrology bill. The total credit balance is only $438. But that’s a lot of money to me. Reading some posts on here I feel like I’m super behind even for a 23 year old. 

I’m a paramedic and a server and work 6 days a week. Even with that I’m only averaging 2600-3200 per month. About 35k income last year. My rent and bills totals to 1500/month. 

I have about $2500 in savings and I’m about to get my tax return and “covid hazard pay bonus” totaling a bolus pay of $2500 which I’m putting straight into savings so I’ll have $5000. I’m moving at the end of July and I’m going from having a roommate to living on my own because my roommate is moving out of state. This will mean my rent is going to go from $1000 to at minimum $1300 for studio’s/$1400-1500 for a one bed. So when I sign a lease which will probably be around May, I’ll need at least first and last and a pet deposit because I have a dog so I’m estimating I’ll need at least bare minimum $4000 to cover everything. 

If I spend frugally which I unfortunately finally started taking seriously in December of 2020, I’ll be able to save between $800-1000 a month. But I’m not sure how much of that I should be saving versus paying off collections versus paying off my credit card. I currently only have one card with a 2k limit. I’m using 1600, been slowly paying it down from being maxed out in December (200$ a month versus only paying minimum monthly payments during quarantine). 

I need to figure out the best way to maximize raising my credit in the least amount of time possible because I fear when they credit check for my apartment I’ll have to pay a premium for having low credit. I wanted to buy a house because I hate renting I feel like it’s throwing money away but I don’t think it’s in the cards.

When I do pay collection bills what do I need to do to make sure it’s taken off my credit?

I look forward to any and all advice given on here as I'm trying to assist my mother through the passing of my father and what her best course of action is.

Father passed away on Christmas Eve and now the dust has settled. Long story short; Dad left mom about 300k in his company stock, about 70k in his 401k, and 120k in life insurance. Which is great, but aside from me just recently buying my first house last year and only a novice at my own 401k (Federal TSP) I'm unsure of what's best for my mother. She retires in roughly 10 years with almost nothing in her own 401k because my dad handled all the finances. Brain cancer put a stop to that and my mom is clueless with her own retirement on the horizon.

She plans on rolling my father's 401k in hers, but I don't know the options Fidelity offers for her to potentially grow that 70k into something a bit more, safely, by the time she retires.

She can sell off the stocks and refinance her home to knock down the principal and hopefully get a lower rate on a mortgage that she can easily afford with her current income and beyond with SS.

She plans on paying off their only car to eliminate the car note.

The stock and life insurance will help make everything manageable for her but I also don't want to see her with nothing in the bank by the time she retires.

Please, feel free to ask any necessary questions to make a conclusion on what advice would be best for her. I'm just looking for options I can look/read more into so I can educate not only myself but my mother on these matters.

Someone new to the subreddit here. I am really loving the support and information available in this community, so I would like to thank you all for contributing with your experiences and knowledge for everyone's advantages. It's quite a big shame that there aren't more discussions about finances in school curriculums worldwide!

While reading through the wiki and other posts, I have found a lot of resources which are specific to individual countries. I am curious to hear if anyone has any recommendations or tips for people planning live in a few different countries over the next few years.

To give a little context, I am hoping to manage to experience life in 2-4 countries (mostly EU) before eventually settling down somewhere. While this is just a plan at the moment, I am a bit worried about things like pension contributions, work taxes, foreign taxes, residency requirements .... which might mean potential ""missed wealth"". For instance, contributing to a pension in the UK seems useless if one plans to live, say, in Italy.

309,"Might die soon during a planned surgery. What is the safest/foolproof/""hands-off"" way I can leave income for my family?","Long story short, in the next 4-5 years, I will have to undergo a complicated surgery due to a health condition I have. While the surgery itself is relatively safe, I cannot grapple with the fact that I may die during it, and leave my family in financial distress.

I just recently started making really good money a couple years ago (I work a sales job, and it is basically commission only, no benefits). I currently have saved close to $300,000 post-expenses/tax (majority of which I have not spent). At my current earnings/expenses, I am likely to save anywhere between $750,000 - $1.5 million in the next 5 years.

My question is, what is the safest, most ""hands-off"" way I can leave behind guaranteed income for my family in case I die during my surgery (or otherwise). I am 27-years-old, married, with a baby on a way (we intend to more kids in the next 5 years). Due to my health condition, it doesn't make financial sense to get any kind of term-life insurance (from my research). 

I love my wife to death. However, she lacks much of the education or know-how to be able to ""take care of"" rental income, and I don't trust any property management company to last her entire lifetime. The other night, while trying to explain to her stocks and setting up a potential 529 plan for our child, she just could not understand it to a point where I'd feel confident in letting her handle everything in case of my death. I don't trust leaving her a lump sum of money either. She is very naive, and her greedy family (or mine) would figure out a way to take it from her. We don't have any close friends or family that I can trust with this kind of money either who would handle it in the event of my death. If it matters, I live in one of the highest COL areas in the United States.

Ideally, I'm looking for something I can set up where she just gets a regular payment every week or month until she passes, and our kid(s) will inherit. Are there any such investment vehicles?

Edit: Spelling/Grammar

UPDATE: Thank you so much for the responses below! Just some clarification about my wife: She grew up in a 3rd world country. Her poor family basically raised her as a ""maid"" and gave her no formal schooling. She had an uncle who moved to the U.S. many years ago with a DV, and eventually migrated his entire family to the States. She's trying very hard to learn English and tried for a few years to get a GED (ultimately it was too difficult for her). She now works happily in a threading salon.

I’m 55 and have been saving for early retirement, accumulating about 800k in 401k and 400k in liquid assets.  I’m not sure how to transition from saver to retiree. I reached out to a fiduciary who’s proposed several options, one of which is an IUL through Allianz. I am not looking at it for the life insurance payout, rather the rider for lifetime income.  

We’ve started the paperwork, so I do not yet have the specifics of the offer, but essentially if I put 33k per year for 10 years, I will be able to draw a “loan” of 110k per year for my life. This of course draws down any payout for death benefits, again, that is not my primary or secondary reason for considering this.  I am interested in the lifetime income.

314,Requesting kids college planning advice,"Hello all

My kids are rising 9th and 6th graders. Though late to start now, how can I start saving for the college that makes it worth a shot? Both husband and I together can save somewhere between $15-20k per year. Beyond this it will be a stretch on our finances/lives as of now. My husband is looking for a job change and don’t know how that will go. If all goes as planned, may be we can get another 2-3k per year from next year, that’s about it. 

We live in GA, so in-state colleges come with some scholarship if students maintain their grades. Both kids are aspiring for good colleges and try to do their best.

My first one is still not sure what he wants to do but indicated interest going to Stanford, UCLA or UGA. Looks drawn to STEM (sciences side) but his current grades (B-) aren’t anywhere close to what these colleges look for. If not, some second set of colleges that are more affordable.

Second kid seems highly intuitive in Math/coding world. I would think GTech or if decides to REALLY go big - MIT/CMU. For now his scores are extremely well. 99% and above. He won some tech fair awards and is generally known for his competency.

I have 3 questions:

1. I am not sure how much to save for these colleges? 100k? I did some funding in a 529 some 5 years ago that grew now to $45k

2. How to prep for these colleges with not so great scores? Some practical hobbies that I can fund and find time to take them. (No exotic stuff like Tennis at $60 ph, equestrian, fencing etc)

3. How to tap into scholarship. What are the ways and means? With two incomes we will most likely not qualify for financial aid. I don’t know how FAFSA works. No knowledge as we are immigrants and never studied in US. However, I recently got a job so we don’t have a lot of savings/assets as well because we were a single income family prior to my job.

Investment Vehicles I thought of:

Roth IRA - This gives tax free distribution of contributions and good investing options 5 years down the line. However, contributions are capped at $12k per annum (married filing jointly). Therefore the max I am technically funding for college is $12k through this option. I may have to fund the rest from pocket which I would like to avoid.

529- isn’t it too late for me to contribute for my first kid? I mean I have to start withdrawing in 4-5 years, being conservative funds these won’t grow much.

Pay down home- put whatever money we save into home equity by the time kid gets into 10th grade. This will reduce regular assets, so we can qualify for FAFSA. I really don’t know how the financial aid works. But I would like to believe this as a non-option 

Any smart saving strategies that give a right balance of taxes and returns that I can make in each of these. Any advice sincerely appreciated.

I submitted mine this year just like I always do, I entered my bank account and routing information and had the eFile do a direct deposit for my State refund and a withdrawal for my Federal amount owed.

It shows that I elected for direct deposit on my State so that's weird but whatever. My Federal however is showing that I elected to pay at a later date via VPS.

I've never had to do this before, I don't know what VPS is and how I actually go about paying for my taxes now.  I went to the IRS [Pay your Taxes by Debit or Credit Card](https://www.irs.gov/payments/pay-your-taxes-by-debit-or-credit-card) page and see their partners. If I go through the process of making a payment via these services am I all good to go? Nothing else to do on my end?

327,Buying a property with gf (Vancouver),"Hey everyone,

Hoping to get some advice about our current situation. So currently my GF and I (28m and 25f, both working with around a combined income of \~120k) have been dating for just over half a year, and while it's been a short time, we've discussed a lot about our future plans. Our future plans include buying a house together (50/50 ownership). Normally I would wait until before we are married before I normally consider buying a house but we are under unfavorable conditions to wait.

Breaking down the situation. From our talks, ideally we'd like to get a detached house (strata free), with at least 3 bedrooms. For anyone else that lives in Vancouver/lower mainland, they certainly know our search criteria basically pushed us to out in Langley (or further east) due to cost, supply, availability, etc...

The issue right now is due to the increasing housing prices, and decreasing supply of detached homes (even in Langley, note I currently live there so I know its massively developing into a townhouse/condo area now), we are worried that if we don't buy now, we will be priced out in the future and have to move further east (Abbotsford or further), and it just isn't practical since both of us are in the tech industry and will likely be working in downtown or Richmond. I thought that if we do buy now, we can also treat it as an investment. Of course the major drawbacks to this is, we are not married and the chances of breaking up in the future, leaving us with a huge issue.

330,Housing budget realistic and are we crazy to buy in this market?,"My wife and I (late twenties) live in a very hot area of Colorado. Housing prices here have been growing at a hot pace for a while (friend bought her home in late 2019 for 380k, now estimated at 455k).


Stats:
- Income: Me 82k, her 48k
- Student loans: 19k left, payment around 250/month after covid forbearance
- 1 paid off car, 1 loan with 4K left @ 2.6%
- 200k in retirement
- no non tax advantaged investments
- 73k saved up for down payment/house expenses
- no other monthly debt


We currently pay $1400 for rent, expecting that to keep going up yearly and we probably spend around $1500-
/month on other expenses like food, travel, gas, utilities, insurance, etc. We’ve been looking at houses in the 350-400k range but we haven’t liked what we’ve seen. We’re considering looking up to 450k but this sounds like a lot to us, with a payment of around $2300. At this price we could get into the better neighborhoods and more convenient locations. We plan on staying in this area for the next 5-10 years and probably having kids in the next 3 or 4 years.


We’re first time homebuyers and we’ve started looking for our own home in this crazy market and are a little discouraged as like everywhere, houses going well above asking with cash appraisal gaps and interest rates are on the rise. All I seem to hear about is how our friends got in at 50-70k lower price than us with lower interest rates... Anyways We’re planning on 5% down so we can keep maximum cash on hand.


Is 450k pushing it and is it a terrible time to buy?


Thanks for any advice!

EDIT: I guess I should’ve prefaced this saying we want to buy and own a home. We’re tired of renting and want our own place that will be better for a future family and our dog.

2- credit card companies and debt collectors are selling my debts to another collectors and when they don’t hear from me, again they sell it to someone else. I think it’s the second or third round that my debt is being passed on. I heard that I need to be careful whit settlement because collector may get the money and still sell the debt or sell the left over part of it to another collector!

338,Looking for advice/guidance on debt management,"I’ve managed to accumulate quite a bit of debt in my 33 years here on this planet. Not proud of it. Goes without saying, but financial literacy has never been my strong suit. 

Currently, I have the following debts: 

Credit Cards 
2k credit card (24% interest)
4K credit card (24% interest) 
23k in credit card debt management program (7.99% interest)

Student Loans (all around 6-7.65% interest)
5.5k myfedloans
15.7k direct plus 1
21.8 direct plus 2 
30k sofi 

All the credit card debt was accumulated in my early to mid twenties after having just moved to NYC and not understanding the real weight of a credit card swipe. 

The last few years have been a bit tougher and a kind of awakening for me as I also took over my student loan payments. My parents had been helping until I got a promotion at work about 2 years ago. Upon taking on the student loan payments, I really started to feel the weight of all this debt. 

I received said promotion at a company I’ve managed to maintain a job at for about 7 years now. Im lucky to earn six figures there. I also have a 401k that they match on up to 4 or 500. (at least they did pre-pandemic.) I’ve managed to save 85k roughly in the 401k. 

My savings acct is barely existent and my checking acct feels month to month when you factor in expenses living in NYC. That said, I have been starting to budget better. 

I understand I’m in a better situation than most and am very thankful for that. that said, I do feel embarrassed making this kind of salary and not having more financial freedom. Im also constantly wondering if I could be doing something better with my debt situation. 

Over the last few years, I’ve refinanced some Student loans for lower interest rates (sofi). I’ve settled 2 old credit cards via a credit card debt management program. I’ve also started to incorporate the snow ball method of debt payment but I’ve let the pandemic and govt deferred student loan payments get in the way of really starting to let the snow ball get going. 

One thing I’m currently pondering is borrowing against my 401k to pay off all the credit card debt to help my credit score. Would that be worth it? Or should I just keep on the path I’m on? 

Right now, I have a target of 2025-2026 to pay off everything, but I’m wondering if maybe there’s other options or alternatives I’m not aware of or may have missed. 

I genuinely want to better at all of this but I feel like I’m just now learning that there’s a game called Personal Finance that everyone else has been playing for some time and I still don’t know all the rules or even how to gauge if I’m doing well at it.

344,"""Identity cannot be verified"" of my 19y/o brother, so he can't even open a checking account!! How do we go about ensuring his identity can be verified?","I (25F) am posting this on behalf of my 19-year-old brother. He has had virtually no support or guidance from my parents throughout his entire life, but especially as a teen and young adult. I could tell that he was not meeting basic young adult milestones, so I've been helping to get him ""caught up"" in ""Adulting 101.""

Now, I consider myself pretty financially-savvy, but I am absolutely stuck on this one. My 19M brother, a U.S. citizen born to U.S. citizen parents, has a basic child's checking account that is linked to his mother's checking account at a local credit union. As his current account allows his mom to manage his account/money, we decided to open an independent/adult checking account for him. Despite personally ENSURING all information was correct, he received notices that his checking account applications were not approved (no reason provided).

I never encountered a problem like this, even though I opened my first independent checking account at the age of 17 just 8 years ago. So, I tried opening accounts on Experian and CreditKarma to see if it was an identity issue and -- lo and behold -- his identity cannot be verified.

**Any advice on what I should do next to try and figure this out?**

Here is what I have tried/confirmed/noted so far:

* I ensured the info on his existing childrens checking account is accurate (editing to add that his existing childrens checking acct is at a local credit union, not sure if that makes a difference!)
* I ensured the info on the application for a checking account was accurate (and also matched the info on his childrens checking account)
* He has had 1 job on an official payroll and they had his correct SSN
* He has filed taxes once and used the correct SSN
* I tried to obtain a tax transcript for him (just to triple-check the above) but cannot because they want a credit card with his name attached for verification
* There is nothing ""weird"" about him/his situation -- he's a 19y/o, U.S. citizen, he hasn't grown up in some ""off the grid"" cult/he attended public schools his entire life, he has a state-issued ID and birth certificate, along with federally-issued SSN/card, he has no name changes and only lived at 1 address his entire life...
* Editing to add: ChexSystems cannot verify his identity either, which seems especially odd to me because I assumed that the info tied to his childrens checking account would be on file with ChexSystems? Maybe I'm way off here!

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

**Edit:** Many have suggested going to a physical branch to open a checking account, which is good advice; however, he has already done this when he opened his current childrens checking account 3 years ago. Personally, after I opened my first checking account in person, I never had to return to a branch again to open a checking account. **HOWEVER, it seems like this is the best step forward -- we will head to the branch of a local bank to open another checking account**. This is just frustrating that he is limited to these banks when they are definitely not offering the services he's looking for. Sheesh, what a hassle!

348,The mistake I made with life insurance,"I got a small, term life insurance policy after my second child was born, but it's been too small for some time. I always meant to get around to getting new life insurance, but I was completely healthy and gained a bit of weight to me about 15 pounds overweight for my height. I kept thinking I'd reapply when I got to my ideal weight, and so I procrastinated.

In 2020 at 35 years old, I've had health issues all year and was diagnosed with an auto-immune disease. Now I am applying for life insurance and rates are much worse than they would have been if I applied a year prior. Thankfully, I am not the main breadwinner so I can get by with a smaller policy.

If you have kids or someone depends on your income, get it while you're healthy and don't wait to see if your health improves. I would suggest that you get a small policy even before you meet these milestones in case you can't get one in the future. Most have living benefits these days where you can pull half of it out if you get a terminal illness, and that seems useful even while single. Don't rely on workplace coverage only as it can disappear any time, especially if you get too sick to work.

I bought my first policy from my auto insurance company and pay more than I should have for it. I'm still happy I have it, but I wish I'd looked into it more. I was sold on the bundle discount, which still wasn't that great of deal.

Also, use an independent agent or a company or website that sells many different policies, there are many sites out there. I used one this time and found out that some insurers are better for certain health issues than others and they will direct you to the most favorable one, so don't lie. My husband applied at the same time and saved $30 per month going with a company with generous blood pressure requirements over one we just blindly applied to. Interestingly, the one he blindly applied to ended up being the best one for my health issues as they give women much better rates.

I wanted to share what I have learned this week, and hope it helps someone out there. It turns out, even Millenials aren't immortal.

Edited to add: Every parent needs life insurance, no matter their income. Stay-at-home parents give a huge economic contribution to the household. Childcare, driving the carpool, shopping, meals.

352,Monthly Scam on Credit Card with Bank of America Deemed Non-Fraudulent by Bank. How to Deal With This,"Hello All,

This is my first reddit post, so I apologize if it's rough around the edges.

Having a reoccurring issue on my credit card account and am at a loss on what to do:

Background on Issue:

On November 28 2020 I noticed a charge from a merchant ""TRAVEL\*TRIPPR"" for the amount of $207.25. I reported it to BoA, it gets removed off my statement, and they change the card and allegedly block the merchant. At the end of the following month, the same thing occurs for the same amount from the same merchant, and I perform the same actions with BoA. On January 22 2021, I get a notification from BoA that they found the first claim to be non-fraudulent due to an invoice from ""the merchant"". This puts the charge back onto my CC statement. I called the claims department and they said the department who reviews the fraud stated they received an invoice from the merchant with my name and card information (nothing about the product I purchased). BoA does not allow customers to speak directly with the team that reviews these fraudulent charges (shocker).

I ask them to reopen the investigation stating it is clearly fraud and that I want to be provided with the invoice and proof of what I purchased. On the last day of January, I get yet a THIRD charge on my third new CC from the same merchant, and spend all day making it clear to BoA that I want these tied together as Fraud and reviewed. A few days later in early February, the second fraud charge is deemed non-fraudulent for the same reasons as the first (I still have received no invoice from BoA nor a phone call about the issue). 

I got a fourth CC a few weeks ago after the third fraud charge and decided not to even open the envelope. Today, at the end of the month, I see a FOURTH pending charge on my account with the same merchant and the same amount of $207.25. This ""merchant"" clearly has a re-occurring scam at the end of the month associated with my name outside of just my credit card information since I haven't used it since changing it a fourth time. I searched for Travel\*TRIPPR online and found a number online on this site:

[https://www.pegs.com/support/](https://www.pegs.com/support/) 

Called the number and a man who sounded foreign picked up, I asked who this was and if he was associated with Travel Tripper and he promptly hung up. Assuming this is the correct number, this is obviously fraud.

Current Situation:

I plan to call the claims team tomorrow (they aren't open on weekends) to report the new issue, but I am at a loss as to watch my options are. I spoke to a BoA representative today, and she stated the third charge was pending to come back as non-fraudulent tomorrow onto my statement, which along with the 4th charge, brings the total up to $829 I'm on the hook for.

I submitted fraudulent reports with both the FTC and the CFBC. I want to close this account with BoA, but am concerned about the impact to my credit score. However, I know at this rate I'll just be on the hook for another $207.25 at the end of March if this pattern continues and I do not close it. The BoA frauds team takes at least two weeks (BoA's estimate) to re-review fraud claims.

**Has anyone dealt with this type of issue before? Is there more that I can be doing to fight this and prevent further fraudulent charges to my account. I do not believe this has anything to do with identity theft, as this is the only credit card that I have that has been having this issue.**

Tl;dr. Re-occurring billing from an unknown merchant on my Bank of America CC has been deemed ""non-fraudulent"" by BoA even those I have flagged it as fraudulent. The fourth time I was billed, I did not even use the new card, so it's clear this scammer has information beyond just my CC number via a skimmer being used at a gas station or something like that. Need advice on actions to take to get BoA to take me seriously about this Fraud and to get the CC account closed.

355,"Have student loans debt, my parents want me to go-sign their mortgage loan. What should I do?","Hi, I am currently a 26 yo F with roughly $280k in student debt (private loans) at an interest of 3.7%. My parents (58 yo) are currently trying to buy a house and currently are trying to get approved for a $430k loan. The pandemic wiped out their jobs and they’ve been living off unemployment checks for the past year. My mom recently went back to work but she makes 20-30k a year. My dad still has his job but the industry may not recover post-pandemic. The bank raised concerns with my parents because their 2020 income does not look great. Pre-pandemic, their combined income was about $100k. 

So my parents approached me to co-sign on their loan. We do not live together, and we live in two different states (United States) so I wouldn’t even be living in this house. My initial thought was hell no, but now they are guilt tripping me into signing. I’ve thought about it, and this would be putting about $700k into my credit report, and I was hoping to buy a house of my own in the next 5-10 years too, so my whole situation is making my boyfriend anxious as well. My mom claims that the bank told them that me having $700k of debt on my credit report wouldn’t hinder me in the future but I disagree. Another red flag is, I’ve asked my parents to disclose their financial situation, like savings, etc but they just laughed at the suggestion and said I didn’t need to know. Ok. I know for sure they don’t have any retirement accounts but that’s all I know. They also wouldn’t tell me the specifics of the house loan they are trying to get which is fishy to me. They keep telling me they’re confident they won’t miss a payment, but they’re 58 now and assuming it’s a 30 year mortgage loan, am i really expecting them to make payments at 88? 

A little bit about me. I make around $120k a year (before taxes) but after paying taxes, student loans, and rent, I have maybe $500 left for groceries, gas, and my spending money a month. I live paycheck to paycheck but thankfully no car or credit card debt, just the student loans. I’m thinking I should tell my parents no and stand firm but I feel so guilty. Is there something I’m missing? 

Thank you for reading

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your input. Every comment I read basically said to not sign it. I called my mom and told her i won’t be signing anything. She didn’t argue with me but insisted we revisit the situation in March but my answer will be the same and I know this is the correct decision.

356,Lease a car vs buy used if planning to drive for only 2-3 years,"Married, no kids, moving to lower cost of living area for better jobs, no debt besides educational. Planning to start a family within 2-3 years and have been saving frugally (retirement, safety net, extra disability, life insurance, etc all taken care of). We are moving to a very sunny part of the country and want to indulge on a convertible for road trips that the area lends itself to. But we only want to keep this car for 2-3 years - enjoy it, then get rid of it for our usual choice of useful, reliable, and used.

The model we have picked out we can afford out of pocket if we buy used and usually I would never consider leasing the new version but we have a finite amount of time with this car - are there any benefits to leasing if we plan on only driving the car for 2 or 3 years?

My mom works in a nail salon and it's currently a cold season in my state so she doesn't make much money per week, while my stepdad makes more than $30k a year. 

Last year because of Covid and sickness my mom didn't work a lot and had to stay at home to take care of my two brothers who are middle schoolers ( she still worked but not a lot).

I just turned 18 and didn't have any chance to learn about personal fiance so it hurts so much to see my mom literally tries to take care of us with her little income while my stepdad gets everything without having to spend anything on us.

**What it does**

It  allows you to enter your own income and expense categories, assign a  expected/budget value to them. You can then track them over a period of  time.

I set it up as basic as  possible, so the expected income and expense budgets are static and not  categorized into months, but for learning about budgets and not being  overwhelmed with spreadsheet tabs I think it does a good job.

383,Roth vs Traditional for 401K and IRA: follow-up questions based on wiki,"I have read the corresponding [wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional), but based on the wiki I am in the middle income bracket and some of the bullet points in both categories seem to apply to me:

For reference on my personal situation, I am 24, live in the San Francisco Bay Area, work in IT, have an annual salary of $100,000, live rent free with my parents, and currently have minimal cost of living expenses. I have changed companies several times in the past couple years due to my contract ending, my company being acquired, etc, but each time I was thankfully able to find new employment before my current employment ended as well as either maintaining the same pay or getting a pay increase at the new company. I do plan to make several large purchases in the somewhat near future, such as buying a new car this year or next year and making a down payment on a house in the next few years / sometime this decade. 

The bullet points that are confusing me are:

* ""I think that my effective tax rate in the future will exceed my marginal tax rate now"" (I'm not sure how to calculate / estimate this. I read the linked gocurrycracker article, but it argues roth is almost always bad? I feel like if it was this simple, why would brokerages even offer it / why would the advice not just be ""always avoid roth""?)
 
* ""I work in a state with high state income tax and/or I'll probably retire to a state with lower income tax."" (I live and work in California which afaik has a high tax rate, however I plan to continue living in California in retirement unless I were to somehow get citizenship / move to another country like Canada / New Zealand, but I'm guessing getting citizenship to one of those countries is quite difficult so this is more of a pipe dream honestly.)

* ""I expect tax rates will not return to pre-1987 levels"" (While I personally would actually like higher taxes to pay for a better social safety net, I think this level of tax increase in my lifetime is highly doubtful given most Americans general aversion to tax increases. If Democrats tried to pass a tax increase that affected retirement funds, they'd know it would hurt them at the polls and probably never get passed / repealed as soon as Republicans gained control. Not trying to be political, just saying this seems like a pipe dream as well.)

* ""I expect periods of very low income that will be opportunities to convert to Roth, such as years spent going back to school, starting my own business, early retirement, or staying home with my kids."" (I might be able to make enough money to retire early, but that being said I like my work / what I do, so I probably would choose to continue working and just be more selective with my jobs / work. Obviously this might change, I've only just started in my career and have no plans for retiring anytime soon).

Basically, I am trying to determine what my ""optimal"" investment strategy should be at this point (particularly in regard to roth vs non-roth)? Up to now I have been maxing out my Roth IRA contributions each year and chose some ETFs / stocks that seemed fairly safe. I have also been doing the exact minimum to get my company's 401K match (I chose Roth 401K, but my company match is pre-tax 401K regardless, only my contributions are Roth). Otherwise I've been leaving the rest of my earnings in savings accounts or non-retirement investment funds.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/luuop7/roth_vs_traditional_for_401k_and_ira_followup/,1614557497.0,2,2,0

We've been together for 16 years and that's just kinda the role that she fell into.I've always been more free spirited, etc. Fill in the blanks. You get it. It's important because of recent news. 

We have a baby on the way. I need to be more responsible and I'd like to help with the financial aspect. I've been trying to learn more about it recently and have started monitoring my credit score...started investing a bit of money into stocks, better monitoring of spending habits... all around trying to become a better provider. 

Because of her, I actually have a pretty amazing credit score. (780)  we have a bit of savings (around 10k) we balance a couple of cars and a mortgage. Excluding that we have about 4k in debt that is student loans, Lasik surgery, Lowes card (nursery) and maybe a few other things

We make a little shy of 100k a year. 

Because of family and us burning through a bit of our savings we have a ton of baby shit and have been stockpiling diapers and wipes and that sort of thing.  

Where do I go from here? I see my credit score can be raised by having more active accounts. 

I mentioned transferring our debt onto a couple of credit cards in my name to improve my overall score and getting lower repayments. 

I've got jack shit for retirement because of my job. It's decently paying, but volatile...I'm not sure what the wife has...as I said...I'm trying to learn more about this on my own time...I 

If it matters I'm 35 she's 33.

Where do I go from here? How to improve my credit score (or does it matter after a certain point?)

If I wanted to start a long-term savings for our baby, what is the best way to go about that?


Is transferring the debt onto a credit card  that I can get with a better finance rate worth it? I assume I'll take a hit to my score when I open a card..

I’m currently in a situation where I’m weighing my options of living alone vs. having a roommate(s). I rented an apartment that was a little too expensive for just myself right out of college and now that my lease ends in about 2 weeks, I have a fresh start.

Financially, I want to save about $500/month after all my expenses are taken care of. This includes paying student loans which are about $200/month - which I am not making payments on now. Car payment and insurance is about $400/month. Aside from that, I need money for food, utilities and a small entertainment budget for eating out/small travel.

I love living alone but think it may be in my best interest to live with a roommate for at least a year and save up. Currently I make about $70K/year before taxes. I found a place I really like for just myself but it’s $1,490/month and I don’t know if I can afford that. I’d like to stay in Scottsdale, AZ as that’s where my office is.

My question: is it worth saving a few hundred bucks each month if having a roommate drives you crazy? I can be OCD in some ways and like to keep my place tidy as an example.

* **GROSS INCOME**: $31K social security, $22K state retirement benefits (this covers my day-to-day expenses)
* **POTENTIAL INCOME:** Not factoring this in now because I haven't been doing it long but I started seeing patients online in my spare time and can do $2,200/month on there. Also could get a job that will pay around $140K/year working half-time. Sometimes I feel more ambitious and consider that and other times I don't really feel like it.
* **EXPENSES**: About $3.5K/mo --- $1.9K/mo rent, $1K/mo insurances (long-term care, Medicare/supplement), $550 miscellaneous
* **ASSETS:** $367K cash, $215K equities

I don't have much in the way of specific goals, just trying to be smarter about these things. I am renting now but would maybe buy a house at some point or rent a second house in a more hospitable climate. I take a $5K-$10K trip maybe every 1-2 years. Maybe I'd like to have the maid come more often.

More details on investments below... I know there's room for improvement here, just not sure what the best thing to do is for my goals (which are not particularly aspirational) and age. I don't mind some risk since I'm not really particularly dependent on this money for living. 6-8% growth would be cool but doesn't really impact my life substantially one way or the other.  
Assets Detail: (not using to supplement income other than taking RMDs)

* **Cash**: $367K
* **Standard brokerage accounts**: $111K in equities... $64K is Gold ETFs/mining, $31K XLE (energy), $16K assorted stocks
* **Managed Chase brokerage** at 2% ER: $71K..... $8K SPY, then a bunch of other assorted stuff
* **Traditional** IRA: $15K is DHI (home construction) stock, + $7.5K cash
* **SEP IRA**: $18K, all cash right now

And does having a carrying balance (within reason) also have a more positive weight than having none carry over? Because if it was up to me, I would just buy groceries and gas (since that is what my card offers cash back for) and use it on nothing else, and then make sure to pay off the balance before the end of the month as to avoid interest, but because I am interested in increasing my score the most possible, I wouldnt mind paying slight interest or buying more non-necessity items for this reason.

I had him incorporate me in Dec 2017 and received the certificate of incorporation from NYS (S-Corp) on 12/14/2017.

Now that I am a bit older, I understand there are tax benefits for opening the S-Corp and am perplexed as to why this accountant didn't file my income under the entity and rather filed it on a 1040. More upset that I didn't take the time to read over my tax returns until now.

He's at the age where retirement is about 15-20 years away, I'm about 25 years away.

They’re currently trying to get a loan..,"Long story short, my friend helps out an older woman & her sister with caring for their home, animals, & various errands. They live in an expensive area & their house is badly in need of repairs. The current hope(& loose plan), from my understanding, is to sell the house. However, right now they’re way behind on their property taxes. Apparently they need $2k more in around a week or they’ll get a lien on the home?


They are not computer literate and have asked for his assistance in applying for loans. They already have two(~$2k & ~$5k) and were just denied for a third. They are asking him to apply for shady loans they hear advertised on the radio. I’ve explained to him that they aren’t going to be approved for new loans and every time they apply, it’s damaging their credit. But they’re desperate and just not hearing him.


Is there another loan option he can try for them(eg; lending tree, prosper)? Is there an organization he could refer them to for help with all of this? He’s really not comfortable doing this but I’ll just say one of the women is the “strong willed/pushy” type, and they’re obviously desperate at this point.

It took me years, but I’ve successfully finished paying off everything with high interest rates. This was lingering debt from school and a job I took that opened a lot of doors for me. This debt was crippling and now we’re on the other side. The investment and risk paid off big time. 

All we have left is a HELOC with $109k at 4.75%, and the mortgage of $400k at 3.25%. I know 4.75% isn’t bad, but I hate making the interest payments. 

Right now I’m set up to be saving $25,000/year into brokerage and retirement accounts. My wife’s entire $80k salary is set to pay against the HELOC except for her 401k contributions. At this rate it will take us about two more years. Once the HELOC is paid off, her entire $80k salary goes into investments—plus her employer pays 50% of dependent college tuition. We have three kids. 

I know we should have a larger emergency fund, but I’m viewing the brokerage accounts as an extension of that cash and we just hit this point of getting out of the credit cards. It’s a simple VTI investment. I’m not trying to go to Vegas via Fidelity. I just know it’s time to aggressively save so I can catch up with my retirement and nest egg. 

Would you continue in this way, or aggressively attack the HELOC? There’s a good chance I will get a bonus that could knock out 30-50% of the HELOC in one swing... but VTI will hopefully beat the 4.75% of the HELOC.

It fits my goals, stable mostly reliable growth of my money over time. I started out doing a bunch of research into different funds and picking a variety to split my money between. Lately though I've been realizing that was pointless and needlessly complicated, given that most of them were just some form of s&p index with different weights.

So instead, I have a new plan to shift my investments too. Yet I'm still sitting here wondering if it is still being over thought. Feedback appreciated.

Also, I haven't settled on an exact formula for splitting funds between them all, was going to start with them all pretty much equal shares of total investment.

VOO - s&p 500 index fund. Nice and simple and reliable.

VB - CRSPR small cap index fund. Opposite of the large cap stocks in the s&p.

VTI - total us stock index. Might be overkill if I'm doing VOO and VB already, but figure there will be some stuff in here that's not in those two.

SPYG - s&p 500 growth stocks. this is leftover from my original over thought index fund plan. I'm reluctant to move on from this one because of how it has the highest historical growth rate of all the funds I'm investing in. I know past performance doesn't equal future growth though.

435,Reducing taxable income after the tax year is over,"So I made a booboo in 2020 by accidentally selling some stock (as a result of a miscommunication between me and my broker) and now my MAGI is ~ $211k. This unfortunately makes me ineligible to put money in my Roth IRA, which I already maxed out for 2020. 

Does anyone know of a way in which I can reduce my taxable income to ~195k to be eligible for a Roth again, given 2020 is over? I live in IL, file as married w 1 dependent and do a standard deduction (we don't have a mortgage). I've already maxed out my HSA which is the only thing I know I can do after the calendar year is over.

438,Looking for some non biased advice,"As the title says im looking for some non biased advice as the people around me are a mix of financially illiterate (to an extent i am as well), people im not close enough to for in-depth advice, or people in a similar situation as me.

For background. I live at home and am a 23yo male, i live at home currently with my parents and while i am two classes shy of my associates degree i am recently certified in my job field and now make substantially more money than i used to. I have a girlfriend who works and goes to school as well however we have no kids and do not currently ever want kinds.

My only expenses are car insurance and payment, my dog, and the internet bill i pay at the house here i traded my dad my phone bill for it as its a bigger bill and it helps them out (minimally ofc). I bought the car because my commutes were long and leasing was just not an option. Beaters were also not an option as i couldnt afford to miss school having it break down again.

Costs:
•$550 a month in car insurance and payment on a 2017 civic with like 40-45k ish miles (total owed 13,200)
•$110 a month in internet
•$80ish a month for the dog, shes got a chronic illness that necessitates a special diet
•$45 in random subscription services
•$300 lump payment a year for a gym, i need to start going now that school is done and im not working 7 12hr shifts a week between internship and work.

I currently make $22/hr, and my first take home pay at this rate was roughly $1500 which is biweekly. I pay out in deductions for life insurance, disability, medical, dental, and 401k with a laughable company match but dont remember exact amounts to be honest. 

*edit* overtime at work is basically unlimited. Two people routinely work 90+ hour weeks and have for years except for a few month period where covid killed some business. I can and probably will work more than my scheduled 48 but didnt think to include it because it isn’t guaranteed

I make that biweekly amount working two 24hr shifts a week with that 8hrs of overtime built in. My job is incredibly secure and unless my entire job field in this area collapses will probably never be threatened. Which is unlikely. My job also comes with a national certification that theoretically allows me to go anywhere in the country, i am currently in MI.

My short term goals currently are 
•pay off my car, my first check at my new wage i paid $1000 into the principle of my loan
•finish my degree although there is not financial incentive to
•save for home ownership (a large part of the reason i went into my field was secure work to secure housing. My family is a carpenter family and bought a house right before 08, it’s permanently traumatized me lol)

Long term would be
•try to finish a 4 year degree. It will probably be worthless in my current field, but i enjoy what i do and want to further my education
•possibly use that 4 year degree to apply to a Physician Assistant masters program one day if i can afford the schooling.

Only extra things i can think to add is that while im not a huge spender, now that i can afford things id like to spend atleast some money on personal fulfillment, im a longtime gamer and would love to finally be able to make a gaming pc for example. Ive always held of as it was financially irresponsible.

From a credit perspective i have no credit cards, my car is my only debt as my work paid for school, and my credit score is roughly 650-680.

Idk if this post is too over the top or if im not going about this the right way but im mostly looking for constructive/objective opinions on if my life goals seem realistic looking at my current situation, and if im doing anything in a dumb way that could be more efficient.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/luk1fc/looking_for_some_non_biased_advice/,1614529941.0,5,5,0

441,Mortgage Free Goal (state by state)?,"I know there’s divided opinion about the value of owning your home outright vs maintaining a mortgage (and investing the free $$) and am curious to hear if this varies a lot by location. 

In short, are people more motivated to pay off houses in full in places with low property taxes?

I live in a moderately high tax area. We pay around $6k per year taxes on a house worth $280k. 

Thus, even though wife and I could afford to pay the remaining $145k of our mortgage balance (3.25%, 11 y left) I can’t help but feel that the house wouldn’t feel ‘off the ledger’ at all with 6k in taxes, plus insurance, maintenance costs, etc. 

I think I’d be more tempted if I had a property tax bill under 2k. Of course, a 15y, 3.25% note is also pretty good.

443,Applying for an apartment when my boyfriend has no credit,"Hi! 

My boyfriend and I are getting ready to move to a big city a few hours away, and I’m trying to get everything sorted for us to start applying to apartments. 

I’m in the process of (hopefully) securing a really good job there, and I have also very good credit, so I’m not too concerned about myself being approved for a place. I could probably easily afford to pay all of our rent by myself if I do get this new job. If I got the position, I would be starting within a month, so I would be moving and need an apartment relatively soon.

However, my bf has no credit - he recently got a credit card but will not have any credit built for a few more months. His lease on his current apartment isn’t up until May, and because he works in kitchens, he really wouldn’t be able to secure a job in the city until he physically moves there with me in May (once he is here, he is probably going to end up working with some people we know, however that won’t be solidified until closer to that time!) 

He does have a pretty good amount of money saved up, so we discussed offering to pay more upfront with our deposit to secure an apartment to make up for his lack of credit and not-yet-secured job.  We also both got recommendation letters from our old landlords to help out. 

Would most landlords be open to accepting him/us if he offered to pay more up front? How many more months of rent on top of the first/last/security deposit would he need to pay? Would this extra money be applied to our rent or would it just be like a larger security deposit we wouldn’t get back until we left the place? Having a hard time navigating all of this because I've only ever rented in a college town with roommates rather than a partner!

I am not originally from the USA so I'm not very aware of what is a good salary. But I see so many young people posting about their income being over 100k and it has made me question if I have made the right decision. 

I am doing very well in school and I really like it, and at this pace, I will be graduating with no debt, though I estimate I'll spend about 30k of my savings. I have a BA in fashion design and worked as a fashion designer for almost 5 years which I think should help me find a job, but should I aim for another field?

I am 35 years old, with no children or dependants. My experience in the USA has only been in restaurants (no benefits), so I don't know if it's common to get benefits on top of the salary, and if I should contemplate that.

On the other hand, going into another field might leave me with student loan debt, and honestly, I wouldn't know what field to go into. I just don't want to spend such a big part of my savings for a career that isn't worth it.

My goal is to convert the 401k to ROTH and pay as little to no taxes as possible when doing so. The 20% tax rate on the amount in the 401k would be crippling to pay in one year.

Second question would be, if I don't care about a same year tax advantage and care more about not paying taxes on my investments, why should I still put into my traditional 401k vs. a ROTH 401k? I guess if there's a backdoor method to go from traditional to roth without paying the taxes that would make sense but until I figure that out I'd rather just put it into roth 401k.

451,Rearranging My Personal Finances (Debt Scare),"Howdy. 

After a recent financial scare I am going to rework my financial control options and hopefully utilize some good modern tools to achieve this, in addition to my new desire for financial security. 

I do not have nearly the depth of issues as some here, however in the past 3 months I have managed to accrue about 2.5k in unplanned CC debt/unpaid bills. I also have around 15k in student loans but I am actively attending so there is no collection/interest worries there and about 5k on a car loan that is also of no issue(planned debt, $150 a month). I am thankful to have caught myself before the situation grew into an outstanding issue and will have the 2.5k covered by the end of March.

My assets are very basic and I currently have a checking account through a local bank and a credit card through Capital One(car loan is here as well).

I would like to transition to a new checking/savings account service with modern features and a good mobile/digital interface as this is how I do the majority of my account management. Ideally with a buckets/vault type system for smaller savings goals like vacations/ski upgrades etc. Bonus would be a round-up service that deposits into savings or a percentage of direct deposit being split into savings(Not necessary, just sounds nice) 


Current options I'm looking at for new checking/savings:
Faro

SoFi(I really like the ability to explore investing options on the same platform as my checking/saving and it includes the vault system)

In addition I'm also in the market for a third party budgeting app to track purchases and monthly bills/subscriptions etc.

It is not clear why I can't transfer to a 401(k), and unfortunately I cannot transfer to the 401(a) or 403(b) accounts because inactive accounts do not accept rollovers.

He and I agree to each pay half. My preference would be that we both pay cash and own it outright, with his and my name on title. But he recently mentioned that he wants to finance his portion through the car dealership, and my cash portion would be the down payment. He said the car loan could be in his name only, and that the title could be in my name and my daughter’s name. He said he doesn’t need to be on title. I’ve always paid cash for cars, never had a car payment, never will. My concern is, if he stops paying on the loan, I’ll end up paying off the loan in order to avoid repossession. I’m tempted to tell him thanks but no thanks, either we both pay cash or I’ll buy the car without his help. So my questions for the r/personalfinance hive-mind are: 
-Is it even possible for my ex to get a car loan in his name only, if he’s not on title?
-Can I get insurance on the car through my insurance company if my ex is on title with me? 
-Can I get insurance on the car through my insurance company if my ex has a loan on the vehicle in his name only?
-Any other considerations or solutions that I’m not thinking of?

Edit to add, in case it’s relevant: My daughter doesn’t have her driver’s license yet; she’s still learning to drive and will probably have her license in a few months. Also she’s not independent yet; she’s a full time college student and lives with me.

Edit to add, #2: I talked with my ex and a car loan is off the table. We’ll each pay cash, so that’s one complication resolved...

I have 36k in a roth IRA. 45.5k in a solo 401k. 26k cash. I am renting atm. Pay $700 + $100 in misc. fees on a 2 bedroom apartment split down the middle (roommate pays other half). 1 bedrooms are about $1100 month. 

My business is 2 yrs old. 1 yr as a side hustle, made 36k. 1 yr on the “books”, filed as an LLC this yr. I’ll be filing taxes soon. Will have grossed 60k with a profit of 28k. Bought a vehicle so that took 15k away right off the bat (otherwise 43k profit).

I want to buy a house. Honestly don’t want to continue renting or living with someone else for much longer than 1-2 yrs max. By then I think I can have saved up another 30-40k saved up. Houses are about 130-160k for a 2 bedroom in areas I wouldn’t mind living in. I plan on living here for the foreseeable future because of my business and I just like the area.

Example:  
If I am planning on starting to withdraw first from my Roth IRA and frommy 401k much later, do you manage your allocation at the total level and hold a more conservative mix of assets in the shorter term one, and more aggressive mix of assets in the longer term, with a total allocation matching your general target?

464,Full-time job and Sole Proprietor 401(k),"Back Story: I have a full-time job that has a company-matched 401(k) program. However, I'm also a sole proprietor for a side gig that I registered for last year in the US (Virginia). It's still developing, I made around $24k last year with it and I am on track to do between $30-35k this year. So there aren't any liabilities and I'm not at the point of bringing anyone else on. 

Questions: I've read a small business owner is able to contribute more to their 401(k) compared to an employee's max. Upwards to $57k or a percentage of the annual revenue.   
1) Would I need to set up a separate 401(k) managed account or could I combine this with my company-matched account?

470,Amend 2019 Return for Backdoor Roth?,"Hi friends, 

I initiated a backdoor roth conversion from my traditional in 2020 and I'm looking to adjust my basis correctly so I'm not paying double taxes. I was a little late to the game, but am converting contributions I made in 2018 & 2019 (both nondeductible contributions since income is too high).

In 2018 I contributed $4k to the traditional ira and on the 2018 tax return form 8606 I see a total basis of $4k.

In 2019 I contributed $3.6k to the traditional ira and on the 2019 tax return form 8606 I see a total basis of $3.6k and does not include the 2018 amount of $4k (this is where I believe I *might* have to amend).

So I did my backdoor roth in 2020 and received a 1099R for $9k gross distributions in box 1 (includes a fair amount of gains from this year's run-up). Initially I owed taxes on the full amount, and then in turbotax entered in tracked nondeductible contributions of $3.6k from my 2019 8606 amount. However, this still leaves the other $4k contribution to be taxed instead of just the gains. Am I allowed to include the 2018 8606 amount when adjusting the basis, or will I have to amend 2019 to make sur the 8606 also includes the contributions I made in 2018?

Currently, I have received 2 job offers, one in Dallas and one in Austin. The one in Dallas pays around $80k, while one in Austin pays $70k. All benefits and job description/role are virtually identical. Except, one in Austin gives me unlimited PTO days while one in Dallas gives me 20 + 5 sick days.
 On a pre covid world, I was a big fan of traveling, music fests, going out to eat/drink on the weekends,  climbing (generally requires a $40 monthly membership), and a bunch of other hobbies. On top of that, I have Netflix, HBO max, PSN etc.  Now I was born and raised in Dallas so I have been longing for some change. However, I realize 2 cities have different cost of living. In Austin, I can live on $70K but I would have to cut down on some of my hobbies. However, id be living in a city I love and be able to partake in more outdoorsy activities. In Dallas, my pre covid salary was $60k and I was able to enjoy all my hobbies + have some savings and contribute to my 401k. I also live in a $1000 single bed apartment with easy access to the city. But the city is getting a bit old and a change would be nice. So im stuck in bit of delimma. Long story short would you rather 

1. Live in a city you love with unlimited PTO, but limited spending due to the cost of living. So more days off to enjoy travel and all but have to worry about expenses. However, it brings a new experience in life.

2. Live in a city you grew up in with 20 PTO days but with more laxed spending habits. So pretty much keep my pre covid lifestyle.

474,Rolling over a Roth 401k to Roth IRA,"I've recently been doing research on the backdoor IRA and mega backdoor, and found that I may be able to take advantage of my company's Roth 401k. First some basic info about me.

* 25 years old
* Annual income of 80k
* I opened a Roth IRA in 2019 and have been maxing it out every year since

My employer offers both a traditional (pre-tax) 401k and a Roth (post tax) 401k. I have been putting in 7% to the traditional 401k, and they will match 3%.

After recently reading about the backdoor IRA and how rolling over allows you to put more into your Roth IRA than the $6K limit I became intrigued and found that the Roth 401k can also be rolled into a Roth IRA.

For the sake of easy math, if I contribute $4k to my employer's Roth 401k, while still maxing out my Roth IRA, in theory this would be $10k/yr of post tax money in my retirement accounts. Assuming I can easily roll this over into my Roth IRA, this raised a few questions:

* Will my rollover (from the Roth 401k to the Roth IRA) count towards the $6k annual contribution limit?
* Can I rollover every year or only when I leave my current employer for another company?
* Have any of you done this strategy before?

Scenario:

Pre-approved for a VA Loan for the amount desired. Immediate family member is my agent. Was told by lender that deposits less than 4% of loan do not need any letter or explanation/gift letter/documentation. Same immediate family member gave me deposit that was under the 4%.

Application sent to underwriting. Underwriter added a condition that a gift letter is needed. This just came through, so have not talked to my lender directly, but read VA guidelines that large deposit or gift must come from immediate family member, and also must not be vested in the transaction.

Will I have any issues since it is an immediate family member? What would the most reasonable solution be?

1. Send the deposit back and use funds from someone else?
2. Use a different agent since the funds have already deposited?
3. All should be ok as long as gift letter is completed as stated.

490,Investing your emergency fund...sort of!,"A few weeks back I made a post asking people’s opinions on investing the emergency and why or why not, got some good answers but the basic gist of it was “accept that you will have to top it off due to inflation and keep it cash”.

That being said, I’m a math nerd (B.S. and M.S. in engineering) and worked out a formula for having the best of both worlds! This keeps up with inflation while keeping you relatively safe from market fluctuations. Figured I’d share it with the everyone out there for feedback and to help anybody else that may benefit from my Sunday evening tinkering.

I sat down and decided I wanted a mutual fund that is conservative with a low risk, and settled on VASIX. Cool, so that’s one part of the portfolio. Next, I figured the remainder of the cash will be just that...cash. Sitting in the settlement fund VMFXX. Now for the fun part. 

You have to come up with 3 important numbers: investment overfund amount, target inflation to match, and baseline emergency fund amount. I used 30% as my investment overfund (I.e. VASIX can drop 30% value and I maintain my baseline amount), 3% inflation, and my 6 month emergency fund amount (which for us is about 22k).

I can bore anybody that’s interested in the math but it breaks down as the following:
Variables:
I = Inflation rate
F_r = Fund return rate (I used the average over the last 10 years weighted towards regency, or 5.92%)
C_r = Cash return rate (same, or 0.81%)
F% = percentage of portfolio made up of VASIX
C% = percentage point in VMFXX
B = Baseline emergency fund (actual 6 month expenses)
T = Total investment
O_i = Overinvestment rate (I used 30% like I said, so .3)

VASIX percentage F% = (I - C_r) / (F_r - C_r)
VMFXX C% = 1 - F% since the % must equal 100%
For my example, this turned out to be 42.84 and 57.16 percent respectively.

Total T = B / (((1 - O_i) * F%) + C%)
For my example $25,244

Multiply T by your percentages for each fund, or T * F% for VASIX and T * C% for VMFXX to get amounts in each. In my example, $10,814 and $14,430 respectively. 

What this gives you is how much to put in the fund and in each to minimize your volatility while keeping up with inflation but also guaranteeing (or as close to guarantee as possible) that you have your required funds should you need it.

I'm looking for some help to clear up some confusion I have w.r.t. contributions to retirement accounts.

I have access to a 401K, an IRA, and a Roth IRA.

Contribution Limits:

* 401K - $19,500 Deductible off AGI, no contribution limit/
* Traditional IRA - $6,000 Deductible off AGI, no contribution limit
* Roth IRA $0 Deductible off AGI, $6,000 contribution limit

My questions:

1. Is my understanding of the above limits correct?
2. Can I invest in all 3 at the same time?

I will have access to a 401K at work, however, my employer doesn't offer matching.

505,Which Direction To Take Regarding Buying A Home In This Highly Specific Scenario?,"My significant other and I are Las Vegas residents, but I am taking a new VP-level position in Phoenix, AZ. SO is staying here for the foreseeable future, because her job and family are here. I will be driving to Vegas 2-3 weekends a month to see her. 

As a footnote, we've been together for many years and have done a much longer distance (coast to coast) for the same reasons in the past for an extended duration and thrived, so we’re not worried about the distance affecting our relationship.

We want to purchase a home as a vehicle to create some passive income and build wealth. We're thinking of buying a small condo in a price range that we can pay off in 5-7 years, and then rent it out and either rinse/repeat or buy a house to live in longer term (or perhaps buying a second unit to rent out halfway through paying off the first). Cost of housing is roughly equal between Vegas and Phoenix from what I've seen. 

Long term, we want to be in Las Vegas. If we buy in Vegas, then I'll rent a room from someone in Phoenix (looks like that'll run $800-1000/mo for a tolerable commute), with plans to spend 18-24 months there. I would then start looking for a way to get back to Vegas permanently (24 months is a fairly average tenure at one employer in my industry). Due to our income differential, I would bear the brunt (70-75%) of the collective mortgage payment/surplus principal payments in this scenario.

Context for the next bit - she strongly does not want to live with a roommate. So if we buy in Vegas, it'll be just her and our puppy.

Alternately, she could get a smaller/less expensive apartment in Vegas than our current one, in which case I would likely need to help her with around $400-700/mo toward her rent depending on what we can find. I could buy a nice, large-ish 3 or 4 bedroom townhome or condo in Phoenix for 30-40% more than the price point we're currently considering. I would rent out the extra bedrooms, putting the rental income directly toward the mortgage principal (along with additional principal out of pocket if necessary) and pay it off in 7-8 years with it ultimately serving as a permanent rental unit. 

The only problem with this direction is it leaves her out of sharing in the ownership of the home, and I’m trying to include her in that. Technically, she could join in the mortgage and ownership, but that would mean me paying all of her rent in Vegas which will be more expensive than me renting a room in Phoenix. It’d make more sense to just give her a piece of ownership in the real estate. (Just want to state that she’s not asking for any of this. I don’t want anyone getting the wrong impression. I’m just trying to look out for her).

We would just buy in both locations, but freeing up the funds to make two down payments would require bleeding investment accounts dry and our emergency fund which we don’t want to do. So we're up in the air about which path to take. Thoughts?

Best strategy?","If I just gave my sister cash and told her, 'save this for the kid's college'. There's literally zero chance that the money wouldn't get spent on daily living expenses. They have no savings, emergency fund, retirement accounts. Nothing. That's the main reason why I feel it's important for me to save for my nieces and nephew's future, as I'm much better and managing money for future goals.

I know my sister, and if I even tell her about me opening a savings account for them, the time will come where an emergency comes up and my sister will want me to withdraw that money and give it to her. For that reason I don't really want her to know that I'm saving at all.

The kids get SO. MANY. PLASTIC. TOYS for each and every occasion (b-days, xmas, etc). My anti-consumption leanings cause me to want to avoid contributing to the sea of plastic junk currently littering the floor of their 'playroom' (ie, plastic landfill). And instead, use funds previously spent on junk for something that nobody is currently doing for those kids; saving for their future.

509,"Early 20s, opportunity to buy a nice car for cheap","Hey everyone. Looking for a little bit of advice on an opportunity that just presented itself.

Basically, my parents leased a 2018 Audi Q3 for 4 years and it comes off of lease in early April. The amount they would have to pay to buy it out is \~20k. They have no intention of buying it since their car needs have changed but they said if I'd like to buy it then they'd have no problem with it.

Since it's been the family car, I know first hand that it's been extremely reliable and has never had any issues at all in the time we've had it. It's a great car, spacious, luxurious, fun to drive, and efficient. I'd also have the advantage of being able to ""finance"" it very cheaply since my parents have agreed that I could pay them 10k right now and pay $500 a month with no interest until I've paid for the car in full.

For context, I'm male, 22, live in downtown Toronto, after taxes and payroll deductions (pension, stock options etc...) I make 4.2k per month with monthly expenses of around 2.5k. I've got 18k CAD in investments and adding 1.5K to my portfolio every month with the leftover salary. My pay is also likely to go up quite significantly in the next \~1.5 years. I've been on my parent's car insurance for 6 years and have never made a claim or received a ticket so my insurance would be as cheap as possible for my demographic (still essentially the worse demographic for auto insurance but still).

I'm just wondering given my current financial situation if it makes sense to jump on this opportunity or if it's a terrible idea. While I don't *need* a car, it would seriously allow me more freedom in terms of driving outside of the city on weekends, buying food from cheaper grocery stores, seeing my friends who don't live downtown more often, and more.

A little bit of financial wisdom would be much appreciated.

512,How to handle IRS Penalties for Excess Contributions to Retirement Account,"My former employer set up an inappropriate retirement vehicle- a SEP IRA.  I contributed to it heavily between 2017, 2018, 2019.  Then in late 2019, former employer was audited by the IRS.  And in mid 2020 I was notified that ""excessive contributions"" were made and assigned an IRS case manager.   I was then forced to withdraw $36k from the SEP IRA.  I was also billed approx $3,900 in excise taxes by the IRS (which are now paid).  Having just plugged in my tax info into software, the $36k withdrawal will be taxed as 2020 income at an effective tax rate of 23%, or $8k.

My questions are:

1.)  What are my options to shelter this $36k from such a high income tax burden- perhaps by re-investing in another tax sheltered account?

2.)  The former employer has agreed to pay for the  excise tax portion- the $3,900.  But it remains unclear if they will cover any cost of the 2020 income tax or a separate CPA fee I incurred of $550.  If they do not agree to cover these costs, should I consider small claims court?  Or... am I equally responsible for not understanding that the SEP-IRA was an inappropriate retirement vehicle in the first place?

Other info:

\-I hired a CPA when I was made a aware of the issue in mid 2020.  For a few hours of work, I was billed $550.  I know the answers to questions #1 and #2 could or should be to ""talk to a CPA"".  But I feel like the CPA fees may negate recouping the costs highlighted above.

I’m 32 years old and live downtown in a big city. I have a pretty good paying job ($65k), a personal IRA, a 401k and a personal savings account. My expenses include rent, utilities, my dog, cellphone, gym, groceries, and left over fun money. Here’s my dilemma. 

I have a Prosper loan for $7,500 left to repay with a 9.64 % interest rate. I pay about $500 on it a month to try and pay it down faster. I have $17k in my personal savings account. I don’t know it I should just pay it off,
or pay interest on it but keep the 17k and keep building up my balance at the same time.

Here’s the balance question: would paying it off make sense if I’m living perfectly comfortably and have a pretty good balanced system going of every month paying down that loan, while still throwing money into my personal savings, IRA and 401k? I guess my hesitation is that next year my fiancé and I want to get married (destination wedding around $25k) and put a down payment on the house, so if I keep building up the savings then by next year I’ll feel good about those big expenses and also that’s a lot of money to part with.

- Set up 529 fund for my son's education
- I would like to invest the remainder in some other way, ETFs, index funds/mutual funds, ideally also through Vanguard to keep things consolidated.
- Life insurance? Any ideas of how much this ""should"" cost me/month would be super helpful.

They offered 15% more than current salary, i was hoping for 20-25% more.

When i talked on the phone with the lady (who would be my boss, not HR), she was hesitant when i asked if there was  wiggle room in salary but tried to convince me about the other perks and not focus so much on salary.

I plan to ask for about 8% higher than their offer and explain why thru my qualifications, experience, etc.

&#x200B;

Are there situations where an employer might pull an offer if the candidate is asking too high of a salary? Due to Covid, i know city budgets are more trim now due to lower tax revenue. I feel 8% more is reasonable. I wanted to get others thoughts and stories.

Our workplace is transitioning to permanent work from home (only for a few days a week, so I will still need to be close enough to go into the office) and so I need to start looking for my own place with enough room to set up a station. At minimum I have been looking for 1-bedroom apartments. I am struggling to find something that falls within the 30% of my salary range.

My take-home every month is approximately $3,000. In my area, the range for rent seems to be around $1600 to $1800 depending on space and if it includes utilities or not.

525,Where to put my retirement funds if I don't know whether or not I'll be eligible for a Traditional IRA this year?,"So last year I decided that I was making enough money to justify funding my Traditional IRA, rather than my Roth as I'd been doing for years. Last year I also joined my field's union, and at tax time found out that having a retirement plan changes the income eligibility for Traditional IRAs to the point where I no longer qualified for the tax benefits. Fortunately, I was able to easily enough have the contributions shifted from my Traditional into my Roth, and all was good.

Now, the tricky thing for me is that I work in a field that is largely freelance, and I don't know whether or not I'll work a union job this year\*, so I don't know whether or not I'll be able to contribute to my Traditional IRA. Is it better to contribute to my Roth IRA in the hopes that I'll work union again, and recharacterize at the end of the year if I don't, or put it in my Traditional, and recharacterize the second I book another union gig and continue to contribute to my Roth for the rest of the year? Or does it really make no difference other than when I'd recharacterize, and I'm overthinking things again?

526,% of Income to Savings,"Hi Guys!

I am 22, and wanting to write a budget plan for myself. I do have a somewhat unique situation to where I am a teacher, and my retirement is already deducted from my checks and is a guarantee because my job is deemed a “public service.” Basically, once I qualify, I get 70% of my average of 5 years salaries for life. So, that effects things I see differently on how much I need to save every month because my retirement plan is already established and isn’t impacted by stocks or anything like that. So, my question is, how much each month should I be putting away in case of emergencies and whatever else may come up? 10%? 20%?

My HSA has been open for almost 2 years and currently has just over $2000 (so I can invest $1000 of it) but I plan to up the contribution to maybe 4k annually going forward (should I max it out?)

I am just now investing it, and I'm wondering what type(s) of fund(s) I should put it in. I have it through Health Equity and it gives me a handful of options. Some are target date funds (2020, 2030, 2040, etc) and others are unmanaged Vanguard market funds and bonds.

We are both healthy, but obviously you never know, and I do plan on having 2 or 3 kids, so I need to consider the costs of their births. I may switch off my HDHP when I want to get pregnant just to be on a plan that covers more.

Anyway, looking for advice on how to allocate my funds. Should I do maybe 50% long-term risky investments and 50% low risk, like an short-term bond (VBIRX is one on the list)?

I’m trying to keep this post strictly about the financial aspects of end of life care. Long story short, my girlfriends grandpa, who lives with her mother and helped raise her, is in hospice care. He did not have his affairs in order, nor does he have anything in assets. Unfortunately, her mother has been out of work due to an autoimmune disease and coronavirus. 

He has communicated before that he wishes to be cremated once he passes. My question to PF is are there any financial services to help pay for cremation for low/no income people? I have my own financial orders in affair and have told my girlfriend if need be, I can pay for the cremation. 

The 2nd issue is that the grandfather currently pays the rent for where the mother (who has been caring for the grandfather but not working) and grandfather stay.

534,My Account Beneficiary was sent all of my Banking Information,"I had a beneficiary on all of my bank accounts (all at one bank), and he's going through some financial issues right now so, completely unrelated to me, he's being chased after for loan payments he owes. Some part of his legal strategy included having his lawyer contact a credit agency to get a full list of his accounts - and, for some reason, my accounts came up as his. This means that the credit agency sent all of my information to him in the mail: full, uncensored account numbers and 3 years of detailed transaction history. I was only alerted to any of this when he called me and read the information back to me.

As the beneficiary on my accounts, his SSN does appear on them, but he shouldn't have access to any of the information until I die. The bank confirmed that I've never granted them the right to share any of my information and that it's against their policy to share any of that information. And, just to be clear, I am completely unconnected to the loan that prompted the credit agency to try and collect all of his financial information in the first place - we don't share any assets at all.

Given that this information is only stored in one place (my bank's servers), it seems clear to me that one of two things happened:

1) Somebody at my bank, despite their policy, made a mistake when the credit agency came asking questions. They must have done a full search on my beneficiary's SSN (he also has an account at this bank) and just returned everything that came up without looking.

Or

2) There was some sort of security breach into my bank's systems at some point that allowed somebody who should not have been authorized to access all of my information (which, again, likely only came up when searching for my beneficiary's SSN) to see everything. The transactions on the paperwork that were sent were as recent as January of this year so, if this is the case, it's not just old data. Somebody currently has unauthorized access to my bank's systems.

To me, 1) seems more likely, but I'm no expert on banking operations.

We've talked to both the bank and the credit agency about where this information came from, and both of them are just pointing their fingers at each other and refusing to accept responsibility for leaking my information. My bank thinks that I personally could have been hacked, which somebody used to log in and collect my information. However, all of my banking is done digitally, there's been no signs of fradulent log-ins or transactions, and I'm still not clear on how anyone would even know to look at my account for information on my beneficiary unless they had access to my bank's databases in the first place. 

To be safe, I removed my beneficiary from all of my accounts (which sucks, as I now have no back-up for my money if I die) and when I mentioned my reasoning to my bank they refused to escalate or investigate the issue, only offering to open new accounts for me and transfer my money over if I was concerned about the potential for future fraud. I told them: if I have to go through the process of opening new accounts anyway, I'd rather just go to a new bank. And so, currently, that's my plan.

I'm keeping a close eye on all of my accounts for signs of fraud while I look for a new bank to open accounts with. Unfortunately, I'll have to pay a large penalty if I close out on some investments I have with them early, so I may have to just start with transferring my more liquid accounts, and transfer everything else at a later date when they finish maturing.

I'm lucky that I trust the person who did open the envelope with my information, but there's no telling who else may have that information, since I was never alerted to anything. Plus, the breach of privacy alone is extremely upsetting.

Is there any other actions I can / should take? It feels like I'm stuck between two giant corporations who refuse to admit even the tiniest bit of fault, so I don't know what recourse I have.

552,"Low Tax Refund ($29), consistently. Did I do something wrong?","I regularly get back what others tell me is a really low refund, and I'm honestly not sure why.  


I got back $29 filing this year, and was only going to get only 4 before the retirement tax credit. I use TurboTax, and know next to nothing about taxes.  


The Federal tax withheld was about 1,200, and my wages were about 24,000. I am single, with no dependents, and am not claimed as a dependent.  


Getting less back than my peers, even who make the same amount as me, is not uncommon for me (most people are shocked when I tell them), though prior to about 2017-2018, I got at least about 140-200 back.

553,Getting taxed on RSUs(USA)?," 

I am currently living and working in NYC, and when I joined my job, I was awarded couple hundreds of stocks which will vest in periodic intervals over the next couple of years. On my 2020 W2, on box 14, I have line for RSU with value 85K which corresponds with the value of vested stock units in 2020. However, these value of stock units seemed to have been considered as income on my W2. But those stock units are in my brokerage account- I haven't sold them so I actually don't have money for them. What's more, when I go to do my taxes, it says I owe $6K in Federal taxes. However, every time the stock vested, my company took some amount of stock units and sold them off for tax(at a whopping 22% tax), so I have already paid tax on vested units. So for example:

    Box 1(Wages, tips, other income): $222,647 
    Regular Income: $137,000 
    RSU: $85,000 
    Taxes Paid: $47,000 

So it seems vesting stock units pushed my income level to another tax level(even though I actually don't have liquid money for the stocks) and the tax that I have already paid for my regular weekly wages + stock vesting isn't enough to cover the tax liability at that level. Is this a normal scenario? Shouldn't the taxes being taken out when the stock vests be enough cover the liability?

My understanding is that the help to buy scheme comes with a 20% equity loan that can go up and down along with the house value, and will have fees after 5 years.

How much of a risk is it to take out an equity loan? Could we find ourselves owing an unrealistic amount of money on it?

Will the fees of the loan outweigh the savings from having a 75% mortgage instead of a 90% mortgage?

Should we be aiming to pay off the loan within 5 years so it stays interest free, which would cost as much as our mortgage payments?

1) Let the $10k sit in my savings account at 0.4% and throw it at my student loans whenever interest resumes.

2) Invest the $10k now (for the long-term) in mutual funds and just extend my repayment schedule by 2 months.

In the past before she worked and when I made less, we contributed both deductible and non deductible funds to a spousal IRA and I'm investigating options for a backdoor Roth conversion of the latter.

Based on my research it would seem that she could open a solo 401k and contribute up to her whole income last year, reducing our joint tax bill a bit. Then I could also look into doing an IRA roll in to allow for a tax free Roth conversion of those prior nondeductible funds. 

Am I missing a downside here? Or is there something that makes her ineligible because of my income?

581,Determining what percentage of income should be spent on rent now that work / living lifestyles have changed? Is 30% still the rule?,"Now that we're working from home and spending a lot more time in our rental properties, it makes sense that it is now more valuable to you than the suggested 30% of your income (rent). It used to be that your apartment was just a space to eat, sleep, do laundry, and spend mornings and evenings. When you're in the city you were out and about all the time and it didn't really matter if your place was small or had some uncomfortable aspects. My husband and I were living in a very cool industrial, and cheap flat. It was a great pad but small and the shower sucked, which was fine because I took all of my showers at the gym.

Now that these aspects of city life have changed and the home is a much bigger part of your life, with many of us needing office setups, possibly an extra bedroom, even a space to workout, it makes sense to spend a higher percentage, to meet your needs, increase comfort, and ultimately allow you to make the progress that you need to with work.

My husband and i left the city in the autumn to live with his parents because our tiny apartment just wasn't worth it. We're looking at moving back in the spring and we're trying to figure out what a reasonable budget would be for our next place and what percentage of our income that would be.

Life will be different... probably forever.

582,Employer cut my salary and not sure how to move forward,"I recently started a new full-time job 2 months ago and after negotiating with my employer, we agreed to a salary of $75k. Last week my office manager asked if I had a copy of the offer letter I signed in my onboarding paperwork, which I did not. I only have an email of the initial offer from my employer of $65k which I was able to negotiate to $75k. The new offer letter I signed was a hard copy that (unfortunately) I did not make a copy of. 

I’m admittedly not the best with personal finance and after this incident I checked my account and realized that I have been making $3k less than what was promised ($72k salary) in my offer letter. This week, the office manager tried to get me to sign a new offer letter (because the old one was “not scanned”) but with the salary of $72k. When I pointed this out, she chalked it up to a mistake from the owner and said they would correct it but I have not heard anything since. I’m going to schedule a meeting with my employer next week to discuss this issue but obviously this raises a lot of red flags. A lot of this is on me for not being diligent enough to find this mistake sooner and for not making a copy of the offer letter that I signed (lesson learned). 

I’m now at a crossroads of how to approach this going forward. A part of me wants to leave the job because I’m not being paid what I was promised and the way they tried to get me to sign a new offer letter with the reduced salary was questionable. However, the job is decent and the best offer I could find in my area even at the reduced rate. I’m also still in the 90 day “introductory period” at this job so they could likely just axe me at any time. 

Before I talk to my employer, is there any legal action I could take for them underpaying me by $3k even if I don’t have a copy of the offer letter that I signed? Even if I gave them the benefit of the doubt and all this was an honest mistake, I’ve been paid for multiple pay periods at a reduced rate so I’m not even sure how this would be fixed. Would I get paid more in future pay periods to even out the difference?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/luhy5g/employer_cut_my_salary_and_not_sure_how_to_move/,1614524359.0,0,0,0

590,Is Mortage Prepayment (not Principal) a good idea?,"Accidentally I prepaid my mortgage for one month a while ago instead of applying the money to principal only. 
(So, while I still autopay my mortgage monthly, my due date is always an extra month away)

Initially I thought this is a bad mistake that I need to fix - but I am not so sure anymore:

Can I simply treat a prepaid mortgage month as part of the emergency fund? Here is why:
- Realistically, mortgage will come out of the emergency fund anyway if an emergency happens
- Instead of having it sit on a HYSA for .3%, the principal part (40%) saves me mortage interest (3.5%)
- The prepaid escrow part (ridiculous high - welcome to NY taxes) affects my overall escrow balance. I am paying less escrow each month due to that. 

It takes away some flexibility vs a HYSA, but it seems like even having a couple or few months prepaid might not be a bad move at all.

We have rented it out for almost 8 years with minimal invested in the property, but are worried our luck could be wearing thin, 5 tenants over that time have been mostly good. The unit is also starting to show moderate wear and will need some cosmetic investment soon if we don't sell (maybe 5-8k).

The townhome is worth ~180k+, owe ~70k, rent is $1600/mo, profit of $400/mo plus what is paid towards principal. Would pocket roughly 100k if we sold.

If we find a new tenant am I at higher risk due to the recently extended eviction moratorium? We can't really afford to cover mortgage/tax/hoa for 6-12mo+. What is stopping someone from playing nice knowing they can take advantage of the current situation? Managing the property remotely will be a new challenge also, even with a good local handyman resource. Not interested in a property manager due to cost.

With this (limited) information what would you do? Hold and risk a new tenant? Take the money and reinvest by way of maxing a new IRA / existing 401k contribution over the next few years?

592,How to target high interest student loan debt? Snowball or hit them equally?,"Question: Should my wife and I use the snowball method to tackle her three Sally Mae variable interest student loans My? Or should we hit each one equally?

Background: My wife and I have collectively nearly 500k (440k hers, 60k mine) in student loan debt. Luckily 420k is currently government loans, but 80k is through Sally Mae with variable interest rates. This 80k is broken into 3 loans, two of which we were able to put on a deferred plan (pay only interest for a year) and the third we had to put into forbearance for 3 months. 

We do not have a lot of income. We live in Chicago and due residency requirements she isn't making a lot. I'm making mid 40s.

Our goal is to pay as much as we can against each of the three loans each month. We have budgeted ourselves to live off of our base incomes (I can get OT and she gets commissions off of therapy hours and testing clients she brings to her company). The extra money I am planning on using to pay against these three loans. This includes the extra paychecks we get (3 paycheck months) our extra income on top of our base salaries, and my bonus each year (1.8k). 

Should I use the extra money to target one specific loan and zero it out or should I pay equally across all three? The loans percentage ranges from high 7-8 and have roughly the same amount of 26k.

I feel like it's a no brainer to hit then equally, but I figured you kind folks are smarter than me and would have better insight.

Hello, i live in Indonesia and having a really hard time managing my money right now. I worked at radio company with almost 30 branches all over our country. 
My monthly salary is around $160 . I have skills on designing mostly with photoshop. Also network management, front-end programming, broadcasting video or audio either with owned  dedicated server or to any social media platform. Basic video editing with adobe premiere, etc etc.

In my workplace I mostly do ""anything"" that has to do with screen or something digital, ie : I managed the office network, I give advice for building pc, do repairment for it, make a stream  player with raspberry pi, handling stream server, designing, digital marketing, setting up podcast studio, make website and manage it. Almost all of our stream server is made by me from scratch. And I do what system analyst do. But with very big difference on our salary .

I get why my salary is low compared the other, it's because all my skill set are self-taught with no legal certificate. And I dropped out from colleges because I can't afford the tuition fees. 

I already married and blessed with 1 son. He's almost 3 years old right now. And I can't help to prepare and saving for his education fee.

But with my current salary, just for living each month is hard, like paying rent, for food, internet, electricity and water bills, let alone saving.
All our saving grace is i often get freelance job for making website for other people with wordpress and do some  designing for their digital ads/adv.

I said often but it's like once a month, or even once every 3 month. 
I know I'm still lucky enough to eat and sleep comfortably,  there are many people who faced more harsh life and had to go through many hardship.
But I want my child to have better future than me.

I often think to stop working and start my own business. But I can't save enough money to even start it.

I'm sure there are people who had through this kind of situation and get out of it, i really need some advice and suggestions on what to do to get more money.

596,Is upgrading to a larger home for our small family worth the extra cost?,"Thanks to everyone in this forum for helping strangers on the Internet navigate tough personal finance decisions. I have been combing over this forum for the last few weeks and have found incredible value from all of the advice and conversations taking place. It's so strange that money is a taboo topic in the United States and such a shame that it wasn't better taught in our public education system decades ago. Now an army of millennials are relying on each other to manage their money--perhaps better off with more salient advice then generations before.

**TL;dr:** We're in our mid-30's bringing in \~$200K, should we sell our first home in order to buy something larger in a more desirable part of town, or just soak up the benefits of a lower mortgage payment in our smaller house in the less desirable community?

**BACKGROUND:** In 2017 we built our first home for a net cost of \~$325K with some great incentives from the builder that helped us equip it with the best finishes (engineered hardwood throughout, upgraded trim, semi-professional kitchen, etc.). The lot is in a great place in the neighborhood, on a street that isn't quite as dense as others in the neighborhood and directly across the street from the swimming pool and amenity center. The community is master planned with running trails, fishing ponds, and lots of green space and young trees that will later (if maintained) create an impressive landscape.

Since moving into the house, we had our first child, and things are getting tight. The living space (open concept) has been taken over by toys and it isn't possible for us to keep it clean enough where we would feel comfortable entertaining friends and neighbors. Luckily, Covid has let us off of the hook for this for some time. Because we both work from home (me permanently, my wife due to Covid), we would like to keep the house clean and organized, with everything in its place, but our problem now is that there isn't a 'place' for everything. We believe that having a bonus room would allow us to keep our main living space clean(er) and restore some of our calm/sanity.

**CURRENT HOUSE:** Built 2017, 2,200 sq ft, paid $325K, refinanced down to 20-yr at 3.5%, currently owe $256K. The house is one story and has 3 bedrooms, office, and only 2 baths. 2 car garage, covered patio, and small front and backyards with irrigation system. Valued at \~$400K on open market, but getting offers \~$390 from OpenDoor. (Equity estimated \~$110-140K)

House is situated in far away suburb in large metropolitan area. Master planned community with ponds, running/biking trails, and two amenity centers is surrounded on one side by light industry (quiet distribution centers), a power transformer station on the other, soon to be a 2-lane parkway connecting other distribution centers and a cargo airport, and on the other side open land that is soon to be developed into cottage houses for rent.

The house sits within the city limits of a major city, but is \~45m from downtown in traffic. It neighbors a quiet desirable city/suburb. Because of the location, the neighborhood is an ""orphan"" without any nearby city services, but treated as an outsider to the small suburb city it sits next to.

**'FUTURE' HOUSE:** $648K New build 3-story brownstone/townhome at 2,700 st ft in the heart of downtown of the small suburb, so there is potential to really be part of the community. 4 bedrooms, 3.5 baths, bonus room, and covered rooftop patio. and builder is willing to give us $20K in incentives.

**FINANCES:** We bring in $200K+/yr, owe about $10K in 0% CC debt for large purchases, lease two SUVs at \~$500/mo (we don't have time to deal with maintenance, and have found this to be the most cost effective solution giving us piece of mind--not here to debate this decision, however we may decide to live with one car once the first lease expires as everything will be within walking distance).

Current mortgage, including taxes, insurance, and HOA is \~$2,500/mo

Future mortgage, if we take this house, would be \~$4,000 on 30yr at 2.875%

If you use the 28% gross pay calculation, this is within our means.

**MOTIVATION:** We're betting on this little suburb to become a gem of the metro area. Older homes are already being demolished in the downtown area to make room for larger/more expensive homes. A major hotel project, which would be just a couple of blocks away, is on ice due to covid, but shows the interest in this area. Our current house feels too small and we don't like that it is situated in the 'big city' limits and next to the electrical grid, warehouses, and soon-to-be neighboring rental home community (although we think rent prices will be \~$1,700-4K there).

**QUESTION:** Should we ""suck it up"" where we are, save up the extra $1,500/mo ($18,000/yr or 9% of our annual gross pay), or ""strike while the iron is hot"" to take advantage of the available home, current pricing, and low interest rates, while also improving our happiness/confidence through a home that we truly love in the heart of a growing picturesque neighborhood?

If you recommend we stay--for how long? To what end? 

**OTHER GOALS:** I anticipate ""it depends"" questions on some of these items, so here's a summary:  
**Retirement:** me: maxed out at $19,500 401k; wife: working up to $19,500 once CC debt is paid off  
**Healthcare:** HDHP w/ maxed out HSA  
**Education:** \~$400/mo into 529 for 2-year old's college fund; all student loans are paid off",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/luf11b/is_upgrading_to_a_larger_home_for_our_small/,1614515789.0,2,2,0

Currently we have a 2018 prius C and a 2016 LEAF. The prius is great with cost and mileage, but the <84 miles you can get with the LEAF is where there might be an issue.

If we weren't attending school and weren't working from home, our current cars would work great for our needs since both the college and my place of work are within 10 miles of our home. I do anticipate that once my SO graduates we may have to move and need larger miles for the LEAF. We've already payed off $6k (about $1k being interest) and have the savings/opportunity to completely pay the car off (\~$10k left). These are the two options I can see at the moment.

1. Pay the car off. Later down the road (if we move and more miles are needed) I can pay 3rd party companies for a larger leaf battery to almost double the miles (***about an additional $6k*** for the upgrade for the costs I see online now). There is also a chance that we could live close enough to one of our jobs that we won't even need the extra miles.
2. Don't pay the car off, attempt to do a trade in for a different car/model (any ideas or recommendations? I mostly want to stick to lower budget hybrids/electric). I am fairly confident that within 6-8 years we will be getting a newer car either way so it is hard for me to want to waste what was already paid of for the last \~3 years on the 2016 LEAF.

He has a good chunk as emergency that I suggested leaving as is, otherwise just invest the rest.

607,Synchrony Bank is one of the most crooked institutions I've ever dealt with. I get asked to re-enroll in payment alerts every time I login.,"I've had some issues with them in the past and have seen a lot of poor reviews for them. I have my Amazon, Care Credit, and Auto Care cards through them. Back in 2019 they caused a dent in my credit because they basically lowered my line of credit. I always pay my stuff off within the period so I never get charged interest. Because they couldn't make any money off of me they lowered my available credit. 

Of course, when I called them on the phone they said they routinely analyze accounts and reserve the right to lower, raise, or close lines of credit at any time to mitigate financial risk. Now, they are correct in that they are 100% within their right to do that. It's not illegal or anything like that, but it's pretty dirty and based on their reviews they play this dirty a lot. Some people have even had cards completely closed out for no reason other than Synchrony wanted to. They do it often if you are someone who never pays interest. 

But that's neither here or there. What has me hacked off with them right now is that every time I go to login to pay my stuff I get this lovely notice:

>Take action! Re-confirm alerts enrollment to keep receiving them.  
>  
>How to stay enrolled...  
>  
>Continue to the next page, double-check the alerts selections you've made, then make sure you agree to the Terms & Conditions (as pictured below) near the bottom of the page.

Literally every time I enroll, and then the very next login they tell me that I have to re-enroll again. This is particularly frustrating for me because I have ADHD and Bipolar disorder so having payment reminders is incredibly helpful for me, especially when life ebbs and flows and I'm not checking my stuff every day. I don't even bother to use their SMS alerts anymore because I never receive them. It's just incredibly dirty how this institution conducts business in the financial industry. I truly sympathize with people who are in dire straits under this recession that have to deal with them. Honestly if you don't have to worry about interest then Care Credit and the Auto Care cards can be worth it, but I wouldn't recommend them otherwise. They put Wells Fargo to shame when it comes to this kind of stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lunw2b/synchrony_bank_is_one_of_the_most_crooked/,1614539717.0,0,0,0
608,Think I have a charge back situation that anyone would agree is legitimate.,"I ordered something from a company on Amazon. Their reviews on Amazon look good, and they were the only ones with the item I needed at the time. But, they sent me a bag of disposable bibs, instead of the item I had ordered. The box for  the bibs was also damaged, and the package was a plastic bag. Their return policy says if the item is damaged in anyways they will not accept. They also require payment for shipping, and suggest I insure the item. So, essentially my $40 purchase could cost me more money than the initial purchase to get a refund, and from reading about other's experience with this retailer they charge a 50% restocking fee and engage in illegal business practices. Their customer rating on Better Business Bureau is 1.  


Companies like this seem like the reason the charge back power exists in the first place, as the fees will eventually drive them out of business. I spoke to Amazon, and I have 2 days after the vendor's response before they'll help. How I should I handle this till charge back time?

We paid 640k 4 years ago. Put 20% down. Current market value is between 740-800k. 3 bed 2 bath in our neighborhood are around 1M. If we add on, I imagine it will cost 150-200k. 

We refinanced last May and our interest rate is 30 year fixed 3.25%. I believe current interest rates are slightly lower, but likely increasing soon. If we add on, we could use 100k in savings, but we would need a heloc or something similar to pay the rest, which I believe is prime +1 or something. So we would be financing 50-100k at that rate. 

Is it better financially to add on and finance 100k at a higher rate? or is it better to sell our current home and use the equity we’ve made, plus the 100k in savings for a new down payment on what would likely be a 1M or so house, at a 30 year fixed rate of whatever the rate is at that time?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lu6w1l/add_on_to_house_or_sell_and_buy_bigger/,1614488406.0,4,4,0

My salary is: $110k/yr + $40k cash starting bonus split over 2 years  + $135k stock grant split over 4 years.

My outstanding student debt will be: 

$20,516 in low interest federal loans.

$20,702 in higher interest private loans.

Take my $20k cash bonus that I’ll get right away and just throw it all at my private loans. From there, I’ll just put $500-$1000 toward my federal loans every month. I don’t want to pay those off super fast just in case the $10k forgiveness actually happens.

615,Had a rough few years and can finally start rebuilding credit,"Income- $6,000-$9,000 (gross) 

I have a repossession back in 2017 approx. 4 years old with $5,800 owed with a status of closed. 

I have two $500  open collections for insurance, and a low limit maxed credit card. 

I have a current auto that is closed with a balance of $3,700. The original maturity date is May of this year, 10 late payments. The first 60% of the loan was payed on time. The vehicle is totaled from hail, and falling apart. 

I want to use my tax money to pay off a lot of debt. Now I am at the point where I have my apartment furnished, a bit in savings so I don’t ever go back to where I was, and a great job. 


My taxes will be around $8,600. I want to put $2,000 in savings, and use the rest to pay off the debt. 

Should I prioritize the repossessed vehicle balance of $5,800, or not considering it is 4years old? 

Or should I pay the two open collections and the current auto, to have title released. 

I’m also wondering if I just pay the open collections, and instead of paying the current non-repossessed and using the $3,700 to try and get an approval on a cheap priced vehicle to open a new auto and building off that? 

The problem I have is my score is reflecting 490. Getting a loan with my credit history is impossible. The car that I owe $3,700 is falling apart. I need an Avenue to build credit the fastest, but also need a new vehicle ASAP, and don’t have the money to invest in a cash purchase. 

I work for a car manufacturer, where I can receive an employee discount. Even on 30% discount off MSRP, 40% under book value for subprime, no approval. 

What would be more beneficial to get a new car ASAP? I could theoretically by a car in cash with the taxes, but I can easily run into maintenance costs for high miles, and the cash invested into the purchase won’t benefit credit.

618,Truebill has their negotiation reps call and impersonate you to your bill companies!,"So I had truebill for a while but because I do 99% of my own bill negotiation I forgot all about it, until today customer service at Verizon told me that someone called saying THEY WERE ME, and asked how much my bill was and if there were any specific discounts available. The customer service rep thought it was odd and tried to verify their identity and the person lied about my husband just stepping out and not having access to a computer or whatever to verify their identity. Then they must've hung up on the rep. THANKFULLY the rep called me back and told me all of this so we reported it as fraud because negotiating on my behalf is one thing, but calling and LYING that you are me, is a whole other level of icky I'm not paying anyone to do. I haven't seen anyone else have this experience so I thought I would share. I immediately deleted my account with them. Honestly, if that customer service rep hadn't thought something was fishy I would've never known that's how they do their ""negotiations"" with your billers. Also the reason I am very positive that it was Truebill is because while I was on the phone with the customer service rep, I received one of those emails talking about how it appears that I have the lowest rate available at Verizon right now...\*eye roll\*

I mean that's hella creepy right??? And yes, I know we give them our acct numbers and info and whatnot to negotiate but I was always under the assumption that they were letting the companies know they were an authorized third party.

632,How to Handle DTI With Joint Mortgage,"Situation: Joint mortgage where one party transfers half of the mortgage each month into the other party’s bank account and the mortgage is auto debited from that account. 

Question: I assume the full mortgage payment is factored into each party’s DTI, regardless of paying half each. However, is the party which receives half the mortgage into their bank account (from the other party’s monthly payment) able to count that payment as monthly income for the sake of a DTI calculation?

I understand the reasoning for the full mortgage factoring into individual DTIs. However, I’m wondering if in practice a lender would account for the reality of one party’s actual payments being less than the full mortgage, particularly with a history of this “income” being transferred into their account.

633,What to do about HOUSING in this situation?,"So I've been living off-the-radar so to speak for about 2 and a half years now. I am self-employed, and managed to get lucky with housing due to my uncle having a house that nobody lives in and renting a room out to me for a very low price. I am not making extreme amounts of money by any means, but I have been working towards building passive income and at the moment have managed to get myself up to earning about $1200 a month passively as a freelance audio engineer. I have about 3 sources of income that are relatively small that add up to this amount. Including the money I make from commissions, I might make about 1600 a month on average. My issue is, I have been off the books entirely. I don't even own a bank account - All my transactions are done through a paypal business account, and I use a prepaid debit to pay bills. - It does of course have a routing and account #.   


Now I am in a situation where I need to find housing, as my uncle is selling his home. How exactly do I report my income to people asking how I make money? I don't have paystubs or a formal bank account. I'm 30 years old and It's been about 10 years since my last documented apartment, so that won't even show up on my credit report - Which is completely empty. I have NOTHING on my credit at all. I remember checking it a while back and it saying my credit score was literally 0 because I am basically a ghost to the system financially.  


I don't have any significant others, kids or any financial baggage of that sort, so I can live off incredibly low means, but I feel like I've just come out of prison after being incarcerated for 10 years. I don't exactly understand how to properly find housing under my employment circumstance. My background is squeaky clean, I have never been in any trouble with the law, and there is nothing on my credit to hold me back, other than there being NOTHING on my credit.

My husband and I unfortunately fell victim to bad choices and self control alongside a negative financial situation brought on by COVID. We have accrued a relatively large amount of debt and are fortunately at a point we’re be can now start tackling it all. We are both working once again and we have budgeted a total of $400 weekly,  starting 3/7/2021, to put towards credit card debt. We’re hoping to get it paid off as soon as possible, but we’re unsure which ones to tackle first. I know the avalanche method but am not sure if that applies because we do have some cards with high balances. Below I’ve listed the cards we have with the current balance and the APR’s. I’m thinking about simply going down the list in descending order of APR’s but am just not sure. In addition to the $400 weekly we will also be receiving some financial assistance in the amount of $3,500 in mid April that will all be put towards this debt.

636,"My personal finances are messed up, and are so overwhelming that I can’t think straight","EDIT: The format of this post came by horribly after this got uploaded. I will re-post this with clarity and good formatting. I will leave this original post for advice purposes from you guys. Thank you again.

So, I’m calling out myself about my personal finances. Right now, I’m grateful I’m working but I hate where I’m at right now, because these will bite my ass if I don’t do anything about it and eliminate my weaknesses, as described below this post. What’s worse is that I will be getting married soon later this year and this will be my project to get back into financial stability, hopefully get the majority of it done by my wedding date. Because of the overwhelment and anxiety of barely making it paycheck-to-paycheck, and the fear of losing my job, I’ve been seeing a therapist to help me go through and overcome my anxiety and depression. 

Any help, advice, or anything else is welcome, including constructive criticism (I can take the honesty, but I will not accept disrespect).

I’ve tried looking into other subreddits for money-saving tips such as here, /r/Frugal, /r/EatCheapAndHealthy, /r/BudgetFood, but I don’t know where to start. I definitely recommend these subreddits especially if you’re into money-saving options.

The following information are as follows:

INCOME:
	⁃	Average annual income: $32,448/yr ($15.60/hr x 2,080 working hours)
	⁃	May have a pay cut due to schedule change at work (not official). ($31,200/yr [$15 x 2,080 working hours])
	⁃	Paid weekly on average of $425 after taxes and benefits, both pre- and post-tax. (40 hours worked)
	⁃	Paid weekly on average of $566 after taxes and benefits, both pre- and post-tax (40 hours worked + 12 hours of 1.5x overtime)

SAVINGS:
	⁃	Deposit of $50 per paycheck (plus extra money after bills and any other income)

WEEKLY EXPENSES (varies):
	⁃	Car maintenance such as gas, repairs, etc.
	⁃	Basic groceries (especially keto-friendly foods)
	⁃	Animal expenses such as feed, cat litter, dog and cat food (although I am not the main contributor, I can help out at times).

MONTHLY EXPENSES (including split bills):
	⁃	Split bill of mortgage payment: $125 ($62.50 bi-weekly)
	⁃	Light bill: 50% of payment (varies, averaging between $100-160)
	⁃	Water bill: 50% of payment (varies, averaging between $15-20 every TWO months [basically $7.50-$10 every month])
	⁃	Internet bill: 50% of payment ($68.90)
	⁃	Car insurance payment: $98.67
	⁃	Renters’ insurance payment: $18.25
	⁃	Subscriptions:
	⁃	Spotify Premium Student with Hulu: $5.46 after taxes
	⁃	Apple iCloud 50 GB storage: $0.99
	⁃	Amazon Prime Student: $7.11 after taxes

DEBTS (financial and personal):
	⁃	Collections debt from credit card in 2015: currently set up payments of $38.84/mo but can be adjusted with a new payment plan (current balance of $534; original balance was around $1,806.54 in 2016; settlement of debt today is available at a discount of $326.44 as of Sunday, February 28th, 2021)
	⁃	Student loan debt: payments will not start until November 28, 2021; recently graduated college last fall (current balance of $37,044).
	⁃	Capital One Journey credit card: minimum of $63/mo currently (maxed out @ $2,000 limit, 25.49% APR)
	⁃	Capital One Quicksilver credit card: minimum of $25/mo currently (maxed out @ $750 limit, 23.49% APR)
	⁃	Owe fiancée’s parents $1,560 for car repairs (can be paid later once I have extra money)
	⁃	Owe mechanic $1,100 for car repairs

MONTHLY INCOME STATEMENT (after taxes and benefits):

Regular monthly income total ($15.60 x 160 hrs) or (regular income + 23.40 x 48 hrs)	= $1,700 or $2,264

Total weekly expenses (not including variables) = $(78)

Total monthly expenses (worst case scenario such as highest amounts): = $(379.93)

Total monthly debt (worst case scenario): = $(126.84)

Savings deposit per paycheck (not including extra money): = $(200)

Net monthly income (loss): = $915.23 or $1,479.23


BIGGEST WEAKNESSES:
	⁃	Food, especially fast food.
	⁃	Impulse buying.
	⁃	Unnecessary subscriptions such as above.
	⁃	Uncertainty of grocery expenses; groceries can be expensive and abhor letting them expire.

637,$836 tied up across 3 postponed concert tix. Chargeback?,"I have 2 separate concert tickets purchased straightforward from Ticketmaster totaling $608.
I am outside the refund window date for both, but at this rate they look like they’ll never happen.

Is it worth trying to do a chargeback for these two purchases? What will the consequences be?

A third ticket costing $228 was purchased through stubhub, a resell ticket originally from Ticketmaster. Stubhub has never offered a refund, and it adds confusion by the fact that it’s a resold ticket.

Please help guys, feels like I should just try to get my money back since none of these events will probably even happen now. It’s been nearly/over a year from the original event dates.

638,Advice on direction from here regarding household budget.,"Hello r/personalfinance,

My wife and I have been Ynabbing for a bit over a year now and love it. We've just recently combined money again (have been splitting things based on % of total income for about a year - we had trouble early with money disagreements so we split it but we're in a much better place now due to some good old hard work and wanted it back together, so far so good - and I want to ensure we're able to accomplish our goals.

We both come from what can only be described as the least responsible of parentage as is relates to finance so...yeah - there have been some interesting choices on our part for sure. Also TMI got diagnosed with ADHD recently and am impulsive :s

Hopefully I give everything you'll need to help, I'm going to sleep now and hopefully I'll wake up to some awesome discussion.

Here's our order or priorities/goals (subject to change based on good information of course). Interested in which order it's the best to begin with:

1. Paying off debt - looking at you newly non-deferred private student loan with a thicc interest rate - Pay it off myself ASAP or get an unsecured personal loan from CU with half the interest rate or something else?
2. Building a decent emergency fund - currently $1600. (of note, our jobs are stupidly secure if anyone cares)
3. Consider a 529 or something more flexible for our son, in case he wants to do the responsible thing and become an electrician or plumber. (Son also has about 4k in stocks, mostly Tesla)
4. Invest our money to make monies.

Some other important notes and then our debts and budget, below:

1. 31 M, 29 F - Gross Income is about 96k , Wife CS is mid 600's and mine is in the 770-7-80 range if that matters.
2. Wife contributes to match in 401k - balance at 57k currently, small amount to Roth but nowhere near max.
3. I took withdrawal from 401k for office related items and some other needs we had at the beginning of the pandemic, locked out of contributions until October - Yes I know this was stupid - balance at 47k
4. I have a Roth but don't contribute.
5. I have an HSA for me personally - no clue what to contribute to pay less out of pocket for my recurring health costs (currently 530 a month just for me - will be 20% of that starting in April once I meet deductible - I did reflect this figure in the budget as an alternate to total expenses).
6. I am fully aware that with our one vehicle more than anything we were unconventional - I don't anticipate much changing in that area for a while and when I calculate my needs/wants/savings, I include it in wants completely even though a non-zero amount should be considered a need even if wasn't something specifically I needed.

639,"Late to the game, looking for general advice.","Basically wondering what you would do, in my very fortunate situation.

I am 31, in a low-rent situation ($800 a month, and I provide a lot of manual labor in exchange for food as well), with no car payment. 

I've been in grad school, which until I moved back to the family farm made it very difficult to save. I have about 8k remaining of my funding to be paid to me by June 1. I just landed a job for 32 hours a week @ $22 an hour, and my take home is $2417 a month. This starts on March 18th. Additionally I have 10k more coming to me during the next academic year. 

1k in credit card debt, planning to nix that in a month. 

No school debt.

Today I opened a Roth IRA with Fidelity and plan to put $500 into it for starters, and it seems like funneling this into a Fidelity Index Target Date (maybe 2050 or a better date) is the best first move. (?) Not sure if my employer has a 401(k), I am assuming yes.

I had been planning on setting aside everything else I can into some sort of savings, but is there a better way to do this than simply using my one savings account with my bank? 

Sorry for the super n00b questions, I've been researching endlessly the last few days and have only recently been curious about investing, but the information is all a bit overwhelming so I was hoping to hear some feedback. I definitely would prefer automated/near hands-off money management, if possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lty0u5/late_to_the_game_looking_for_general_advice/,1614462135.0,7,7,0
640,Advice please? Pay off credit card or save,"Hello everyone. This is my first post on this sub and I’d really appreciate some advice. I’m a 24 y/o college student with credit card debt. I have 7 credit cards and 6 of them are almost maxed out. I am not proud of this at all. However I ended up in this situation because Of different reasons. When I moved on my own to go to college I had no support from my parents. I worked at CVS making chump change since I didn’t get a lot of shifts at first. So I applied for a credit card and got approved. Then I applied again and again and again over the next years and always got approved. At first I just used them for basic needs I couldn’t afford. But eventually everything got out of hand and I dug a hole deeper than I wanted. 

Last year I lost my job (not CVS) during the pandemic and my parents started helping me out with my bills. But back in January a woman I use to babysit for called and asked me to watch her kids while she’s at work and they do online school. She pays about $600 a week. And my parents give me $400 every two weeks. So that’s $3200 a month. That’s more money than I’ve ever made in a months time. However all good things must end. She will only need me until May and my parents will stop eventually as well. So I’m trying to save as much as possible. I even opened a savings account at a local credit union yesterday to deposit money and not touch it. 

So here’s what I need advice on. I need to move from my apartment in July. The place that I am moving to will cost an extra $300 in rent than what I’m paying right now. However this place does not require first/last and security. Just $500 down and $80 application fee. Because I do not know the future and if I’ll be able to find a steady job when I’m done with the full time babysitting I want to have 5-7 months worth of rent saved up. I will also be receiving around $4000 in student loans in the coming fall semester. And that’ll be going in the savings too. But right now I want to pay off at least one credit card. The card I want to pay off is at $1,196. I want to pay it in full. But idk if I should just keep this money in my pocket or pay it off right now. It’ll leave a dent right now but I still have 3 more months of babysitting sitting so I’ll make more money. Like I said I’ve never made this much money a month and I just want to be as responsible as possible. And I want to start paying my debt down so I can close those credit cards. 

Sorry for the long post. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!

*Edit* I should have explained why I’m moving to a more expensive place. My apartment is not well maintained by the owners. I have had several complaints over the last 4 years that I’ve stayed here. I get constant leaks, A/C breaks down literally almost every month. Hell when I first moved in part of the floor was caving in because of water damage (so they said). The ventilation system is also really bad and negatively affecting my health. Also the surrounding area is becoming unsafe. A lot of shady people moving in. My roommate is leaving when the lease is up and I am too. The new place I found is a bit more pricey but it’s the cheapest option.

642,Think Twice Before Moving Into Your Rental To Avoid Taxes,"> The IRS doesn’t want people abusing the five-year rule with rentals that they move back into just before the sale.

644,Should I pay off most of my debt at once?,"Delete this if I'm breaking any rules, but I figured I'd ask my question to get a more personalized answer. 

I'm 36 and over the past 3 years, I've gone from working check to check to a salaried job. I've been absolutely terrible with my finances my whole life and have had the goal to dig myself out of this hole to be free of debt. No savings, no retirement plan, and I'm sure over all of the jobs I've had over the years, 401k stuff is probably floating around for me that I should probably look into (No idea where to start). As you can see, I'm a manchild. haha. 

So here is my break down:

I have just over $22,000 in my bank account (I got a massive bonus last year to thank for that)
My debt includes the following:

* Apple Credit Card - $1200 (19.99 interest)
*  Chase Credit Card - $1500 (24.99 Interest)
* ECSI Loan - $2300 (12% Interest)
* Main Chase Credit Card - $6800  (22.24 Interest)
* Stafford Loan - Roughly 60k

Monthly Income: $1300 Bi-weekly ($2,562-3,843 depending on if I get 2 or 3 paychecks in the month)
Monthly expenses:
* $194 on Main chase card
* $44 on Secondary chase
* $94 on ECSI loan
* $40 on Apple card
* 0 on Stafford
* roughly 600-700 on rent (I do the grocery shopping for my rent split on top of $200 upfront) 
* total - $972-$1,072

Because of Covid, I haven't touched my  Stafford loans. My idea was to knock out the first 3 loans right this moment ($5,000) then spend the next 6-8 months paying down my main credit card until my Stafford loans kick back in. That way, the only debt I'll be paying off would just be my student loans.

I have the means to do this but because I've been so bad with my finances most of my life.. and the fact that my bank account is over 20k when just 3 years prior I had never had it above 2k I'm sort of paralyzed in how to proceed. I want to be debt-free but also be able to save, and invest the money I make.

I'd appreciate any advice.

I think you learn so much more when you chose categories that are specific to you, where you spend and receive money. Rather than using an app or someone else’s spreadsheet I encourage you to try your own. I made one on Sheets so I just enter expenses on my phone in the template I made (this works for me). 

It can even be fun making pie graph or any type of graph really (sorry to nerd out) of spending habits or tendencies.

When the savings account got to 3k, I put the money into a brokerage account in my name to take advantage about 20 years of growth before I give it to him around his 18th birthday.

When I give it to him, can i just transfer the account to him?  This would allow him to sell the investment and claim it as income and pay it as his tax rate (which will almost certainly be lower than mine).  Or do i have to sell it and then gift him the amount?

There are a couple of reasons I chose not to do a UGMA or a 529, mostly because i want the money to have no strings attached whatsoever.

It appears to me that my only option will be to sell of the investment and claim that as my income, so I will pay the taxes out of the amount I get from the sale, then transfer the remainder to my son.

648,Short Term Savings?,"Hey guys,

I was hoping for some advice on how to best go about saving for a large expense 2 to 3 years down the road, like maternity leave or a car or something of that sort. 

I have a savings account with my bank, but only keep about $1000 in their because I tend to spend it if I have access to it. I am currently saving for retirement, set to pay off the house early, and saving for kids college fund. 

Basically I want something set away from my main bank that I can just leave alone for a few years while it grows.

If the 401k was cashed out this is absolutely fraud.  But I have no idea how to proceed.  I filed my taxes two weeks ago.  I know I didn't actually cash it out, but the IRS doesn't.  I assume I should just hold on to the 1099r until I sort this out.
Should I report it to the police first or give the bank a chance to sort it out?  I've had my info stolen before, but the bank in question just refunded the money and issued new account info.  Is there anything else I can use to help prove I did not cash it out?  I can show my bank statements show no deposits, but will that be enough?

I’ve been reading recently throughout the internet about the potential of jobs being loss to automation within the next couple of decades. Considering that I currently work as a post closer for a mortgage company, it is starting to weigh in on me if I will soon lose my job anytime soon. I have read from multiple sources that positions that work with me, e.g., mortgage loan officers, underwriters, processors, and closers are very susceptible to automation. However, I do find that a number of people do not think this will be the case that automation will completely take over. The whole idea of this has me worried as I am only 23 years old, and I find it sort of depressing to think that in the next 10 years or so I’m gonna unemployed. 

I am curious to see what others on hear think. My parents don’t think to seem so(my mom works as a mortgage closer), while some of my friends say that maybe 20 years from now it will be the case, but that I should’t worry, because I’ll be in a much better position.

Edit: For those that don’t know what post closers do, we assist in the closing process for people trying to get mortgages for homes. In short, this includes reviewing loan documents, and ensuring that they comply and are complete. We are the final step in the home loan lending process.

1. Loan amount of $290,147 at a 30 year fixed rate at 2.625% with closing costs of $3 (Much of the closing costs have already been rolled into the new loan balance). Total savings cost would be $24,023 at 10 years according to the Zillow refinance calculator.
2. Loan amount of $288,633 at a 30 year fixed rate at 2.75% with no closing costs (Much of the closing costs have also already been rolled into the new balance). Total savings cost would be $22,368 at 10 years according to the Zillow refinance calculator.

Because of the cost savings at 10 years I'm leaning towards option 1 with the 30 year fixed rate term at 2.625%. I've heard from others that it's better to take a higher interest rate with $0 in closing costs but looking at the cost savings 10 years down the line it looks like I would come out ahead if I opted for the lower interest rate but higher closing costs.

665,Collections for a bill I never got?!,"Hello! I am struggling with a collections account, and I could use advice.

## Summary

The short version is this:

* I moved at the beginning of November.
* I canceled my electric service after I moved.
* I thought I had paid my final bill, and I canceled recurring payments. (More on this later.)
* I recently received a letter from a collections agency for the final bill. The amount is a little over $80.
* I had never received a final bill in that amount. The collections letter was the first time I learned about the amount owed.
* I tried sending a settlement offer (a pay-for-delete type thing) and got no response.

I'm trying to figure out the best path to protect my credit. I have an otherwise perfect payment history. I am happy to pay the electric bill. I am just not happy with a collections account on my credit report for 7 years.

I'm sharing more details below. It's hard to tell whether this is my screw-up, the electric company's screw-up, or both. The more I read about collection accounts, the more I realize I could have handled things differently. I'm just trying to get to the best possible outcome here, and I appreciate any advice the sub can offer.

## Timeline

* 10/31: I move out of my apartment.
* 11/3: I cancel electric service. I have a confirmation email indicating the final bill will be delivered paperless.
* 11/4: The final bill is issued. **I did not know this** and I never received this bill, either through mail or email. (I did receive other emails, like payment confirmations, but I never received any bill by email.)
* 11/5: My automatic payment is processed for the previous month's bill (not the final bill).
* 11/10: The final bill is updated with a different balance. Again, I did not receive this updated bill or the original.
* 11/11: I canceled recurring payments. (See note below.)
* 1/14: Date on a letter from a collection agency.
* 2/5: When I receive that letter. **This is when I first became aware of the unpaid bill.** I checked my electric account online, started checking my records, and reading about what to do.
* 2/7: I mail a settlement offer to the collector. I offer to pay the amount in full, in exchange for removing the information from my credit report. The letter was based on a template, so it was dry and didn't include any unnecessary details. I asked for a response within 15 days.
* 2/27: I receive another letter from the collector, but it's just a standard collection letter, not a response to the settlement offer.

I was going through a lot of moving chaos at the time, and I had read some advice about canceling automatic payments for utilities to avoid being charged in case later tenants don't set up their account promptly. In retrospect, this was stupid and costly. Just wanted to explain why I did this weird thing.

Given the timeline, I *should* have seen an unpaid balance when I went to the website to cancel my recurring payments. I don't have any evidence of this, but I just can't believe that I would have ignored an unpaid balance if it had been showing.

## Mistakes were made

As far as I can tell, the collection account isn't an error *per se*, not by legal standards anyway. But it's an extremely frustrating experience to have my credit ruined over some clerical errors. Here's what I think happened:

On one hand, I (stupidly) canceled automatic payments too early. Clerical error #1.

On the other, the electric company failed to send me the bill. I know what you're thinking: I was moving, things get lost, I probably just threw it away. I thought the same thing. But when I looked at the unpaid bill online, it includes a *paperless bill credit*.

So I looked through my email, and I have no bill. My boyfriend uses the same electric company, and he showed me his paperless bills in his email. I have lots of other emails from the electric company, like payment confirmations, but never a bill. Clerical error #2, maybe a system bug for the electric company, or maybe I messed up my paperless settings somehow.

Then, I got the collections letter. Mistake #3: Trying to settle instead of just paying the thing. Is it true that if I had paid it immediately, it wouldn't have gone on my credit report? I'm finding it so hard to get accurate information on how to handle this the right way.

Mistake #4: Waiting to receive a response instead of just requesting validation of debt right away. I learned today that I only had 30 days. But sources differ between whether it's 30 days from when the collector sent the letter, or whether it's 30 days from when I received it.

## Help!

What do I do now? Some ideas I have:

1. Call the electric company, explain the situation, and try to pay the bill to them. Then, dispute the collection account. (I figure this probably won't work, but that it also can't hurt.)
2. Send a check to the electric company referencing the bill, and see if they accept the payment. If they do, would this help me dispute the collection account?
3. Request debt verification to the collector. It might be too late (is it?) but if it isn't, I'm still not sure how this helps. Won't the collector probably be able to verify it? Will it harm me if they do?
4. Call the collector and explain. Everything I have read says to never call them. But is this true when I am willing to pay the full amount? Is it possible to negotiate on the phone?
5. Write a good will letter to the collector, explaining the above. Any advice on how to do that? I doubt any collector wants to read all that.
6. Write a good will letter, and include payment in full.

I'm not worried about the money, but I'm really worried about my credit. I want to buy a house soon.

674,Calculator or formula for taxable income reduction vs 401k contributions?,"My wife and I underwithheld by a combined $2k for 2020.  This isn't a problem but I was wondering if there is a calculator or form somewhere that will show if it's possible to, instead of increasing our withholdings, simply increase our 401k contributions to reduce the taxable income to the point we break even?  Or is that even possible?  I know it would have to do with what bracket we are in.  I need something that also takes into account both incomes as filed married joint.  I believe there is a savers credit that may factor into it as well.   We are both at 6% pretax contributions so nowhere near the max, but not sure if the amount of pretax deductions required to offset the taxable income would require a significantly larger payroll deduction compared to just having additional tax withheld.

Any simple way to figure this out?

**So to answer all the responses, yes I filled out the new withholding W4 last year.  I filled it out for both of us and followed the directions and it underwithheld us.  Part of it appears to be my wife making significantly more last year than the previous year due to overtime and raises.

It's like the new W4 didn't take into account both incomes?   The new one is waaay more confusing and involved.  I never had an issue with the old single page simple W4.  I've been using it to successfully come as close to possible to break even for both of us for many years.  Now all of a sudden I'm getting bad info from the new one.

I've gone to a few banks and was not really satisfied with the information that I got: they either suggested HELOC or said a personal loan, but that wouldn't cover the amount I think I would need (\~$300k). A HELOC is not going to work. One bank told me that I would probably need a construction loan, and then refi it once the construction was complete. But since the property is in my mother-in-law's name, we'd have to set up a living trust or deed, or something in order to get this to work. They suggested I contact my own bank for more info, but they couldn't really help me since they don't offer construction loans. My wife is the only beneficiary of the house and the land once her mother passes away, but I think that we would need to do something legally in order to make this work the way we envision it. Luckily my mother-in-law is a gem and is willing to help us with whatever is necessary to get this done.

676,Appraisal of new construction home,"We are buying a new construction home and builder is giving us an incentive for using their own mortgage company. I have few questions about using them.

1. Their interest rate at the time of discussion was similar to outside lenders.

2. Closing costs were about $1000-1200 more than other lenders.

3. Incentive is about $6000 towards closing or buying down points.

Question:

1. Should we use them since it is similar to outside lenders but has about$4500-5000 back as incentive?

2. Why do they need to charge $800 for appraisal of their own building home? How to negotiate that fee? Or have it waived?

3. They are charging processing fee of $1600 way more than other lenders (about $500-750 range)

Since both of our income are significantly different and have no dependent, (1) ~ $50,000-$59,999, (2) ~ $30,000-39,999. We calculated the extra withholding to be $3280/26(every 2 week) = $126.15. Now this is where the confusion begin, whose W-4 do $126.15 goes on?(I see that it said on the higher income but if it goes on the higher income does the lower income need to file a W-4?) How many W-4 do we need to file? If two W-4 need to be file and only 1 have the $126.15 extra withholding, would the second W-4 just have 1(c) Married filling jointly box check and that is it?

We currently have the higher income W-4 have the extra withholding($126.15) and the lower income W-4 leave blank and just have 1(c) Married filling Jointly box check. But when we compare our pay stub, the lower income only have around 3 percent of the check withheld.

For myriad reasons I am in a terrible hole financially and don't even know where to begin digging myself out. I'm happy to discuss the ""why""s with anyone, but I'll leave that for PMs. Please, please, please don't judge me. 

So, in a nutshell, I'm going to be 9 years in arrears on my taxes (state, federal, all of it), years for which I have not even filed. I also have, at this point, probably \~$20,000 in medical debt. No credit cards, no house or really much of anything to my name save for the clothes on my back. 

I'd desperately like to somehow dig myself out of these financial holes and become a fully-fledged decent citizen again; one who pays all taxes on time, owes little to nothing in debt, and has decent credit. I really have no idea where to begin, or if it's even possible for me get back on the level with things. 

I currently have a decent (but not great) job and rent a place to live, but beyond that little else. 

Is my best course of action regarding the medical debt simply to declare bankruptcy? Is it even possible to settle up somehow with the IRS given that I have probably very shoddy records of any income in the last 9 years or so? I've had relatively little income in that period of time, sustaining myself mostly on inconsistent employment and money from my parents. 

I was never looking to try and scam anyone and certainly never intended to not pay my fair share in taxes and such. It just kind of...well..happened that way, for reasons as I said I'm happy to discuss but probably only gum up the works in this forum.

691,Non-Deductible IRA Contributions,"I'm working on filing taxes with TaxAct. My company provides a 401k which I max out the matching contributions for.

So I'm feeling all accomplished being a young person having multiple retirement accounts. Then today I'm trying to file my taxes and I run into an issue. It is showing that none of my IRA contributions are deductible because I am covered by a retirement plan at work (401K) and my MAGI is > $75,000 (TaxAct info pasted below). Last year this wasn't applicable because I made <$65,000. I also apparently didn't even put anything about my IRA on my taxes last year :face\_palm:. Feeling a lot less put together at this point.

So my questions:

\- Is there anything I can do before I submit my taxes to fix this? Or do I just take the hit and learn for next year?

\- Do I just leave the traditional IRA account with $12000 in it sitting there? Or try to transfer it?

\- Do I just contribute the extra $6000 a year to my 401k? or should I try to create a Roth IRA (it seems that has higher income limits)?

696,Does Making an Auto Insurance Claim Cause Your Rates to Go Up Regardless of Fault?,"I was reading the thread that was pretty popular yesterday or the day before about someone getting dropped from homeowners insurance for making multiple claims and I was wondering if that was the case with auto insurance as well?

I drive many miles to get to and from work (100-150 miles round trip) so it's unsurprising that over the years I've gotten into a few accidents.  (I'm also a member of a volunteer fire department, so we take a driving class every year, but even watching out for other people's mistakes, there's only so much you can do to avoid an accident sometimes!)  I had one at fault accident 14+ years ago, but never had another at fault accident since then.  I have had a few non-at fault incidents though (parked car backed into by someone I knew who let me know, parked car involved in a hit and run caught on camera-owner found with police help, car side swiped by a semi on a highway, car pulled out against a red light in front of me, rear-ended by a car on a freeway as I slowed down to avoid debris, side swiped by a pickup who failed to check his blind spot changing lanes).

However, when I do get into an accident, I've never contacted my own insurance company, and just work with the other person's insurance company directly so my insurance company won't find out about it.  The other day, a friend of mine got me thinking as he rode in my car for the first time and saw my dashcam setup.  I had mentioned that it makes claims when someone else is at fault really easy--I told him I send the other guy's insurance company the video footage and the discussion quickly goes from ""are you sure he's at fault, let's wait for all of the police paperwork"" to ""OK, how much is the damage and where do you want the check sent?""

His response was: ""Why are you working with the other guy's insurance? Submit your claim to your own insurance and let them sort it out with the other guy's insurance!  That's what you're paying them for!""

So I guess my questions are these:

1. If I am not at fault, will submitting the claim through my own insurance cause my rates to go up?
2. If I submit the claim through my own insurance, will I have to pay my deductible and any not covered expenses (rental car, missed work) out of pocket?  Or do they go after the other party for the full amount?

701,Is Synchrony Bank's savings account good for a young adult who infrequently makes purchases and wants ATM access?,"I recently turned 18, so I'm going to get a bank account that I actually own, rather than one that's primarily owned by my dad with me only having secondary access, now that it's legal to do so. My current bank account sucks, so I'm looking for alternatives to it because I'm switching accounts anyways.

As of right now, I don't actually buy anything very often as my dad pays for most of my existence except for things that I want but don't need, and is expected to do so until I graduate college. That said, I would still like to grow my money so I have a better start when I do eventually need to pay for my existence, so I want a high interest rate. Additionally, I sometimes use cash for more informal transactions (and, more importantly, I have too much cash under my bed that I need to deposit), so I'd like ATM access.

Given my situation, I think an online savings account with ATM access is the best option for me, because an online savings account will have very high interest, and I don't anticipate going over the limit of 6 transactions per month for a while. (I don't make that many purchases, and I can make them with cash or a credit card, in which case according to my understanding the withdrawal or the monthly payment on the card only counts as one transaction on the account no matter how many things I pay for with them.) However, support for ATMs on online savings accounts appears to be relatively rare, and the only ones I could find which had what I want were Axos and Synchrony.

I decided to read reviews, and Axos had almost no good customer reviews (despite shilly sites calling it the best bank ever) and lots of bad ones related to days-long server outages, actions taking weeks to happen, and them stealing people's money which seems to have started in 2018 when they got bought out by someone. So although they offer a better interest rate than Synchrony (0.61% vs 0.5%), I don't think I want to deal with them. Almost all the reviews I could find on Synchrony were roughly evenly split between people complaining about their credit cards scamming them with hidden extremely high interest rates and people saying that those people just didn't know how interest worked and were blaming the bank for their incompetence. Either way,  I'm not sure if I'll be getting a credit card at all in the near future and probably won't be getting it from them if I do. However, I couldn't find much of anything related to the savings account, the service I'm interested in. Also, the nearest Accel ATM is a 20 minute drive away and in the city, which I think might become inconvenient.

So is Synchrony Bank's savings account the best thing that's available for what I want? Are there better options that I overlooked?

703,"Sell Accord, Drive old Ranger, Trade?","I am in a lot of debt. I want to get out of debt and improve my situation as much as possible before end of the year.

I have a 2015 Honda Accord with 50k miles and it’s payment is $288 a month and owe about $9500 on it. I have extended warranty for a couple more years as well. All original tires so it needs 4 new tires. It’s been great and very reliable. Based on KBB and what I’m selling similar ones listed for I am not upside down.

I also have a 1999 ranger that is paid off. It’s not perfect by any means but it only has about 117k miles and is 4WD. Probably needs 2 new tires, new wipers, all new brakes and the heater core is clogged so heat barely works. As is, I’d say it’s probably worth 3-4k. 

My work commute is about 50 miles round trip almost all highway. The accord averages 33MPG. I have no idea what the ranger gets but probably something like 17-18 MPG max. 

I have full coverage on the accord it’s about $65 a month, ranger is just liability and is $33 a month.

The accord per month roughly cost me:
$288 + $65 + $87 (35 gallons x $2.50) = $440

The ranger if I did the work commute would cost me:
$33 + $150 (58 gallons x $2.50) = $188

So that’s about $250 savings per month (assuming same yearly maintenance costs). The ranger would probably need about 1k put into it over first couple months as well. 

1. Do I just keep the reliable Accord?
2. Do I sell the accord, save $250 a month, and hope the ranger can handle the commute?

704,Tax Question - 401(k) --> ROTH IRA Conversion and Unemployment,"Good evening,

I switched jobs in 2019 and last year I thought (at the time) it would be smart to consolidate my old 401(k)'s from old jobs (only around $13,000) into a Roth IRA with Ameritrade. This was done in March/April of 2020 and I was aware there was some some tax implication, but didnt know the exact amount. I was furloughed in April through mid/late July due to COVID and received unemployment during that span. 

I opted to have taxes taken out of my unemployment check to lessen the tax burden as I knew that it would count towards my income. 

As I am starting to do my taxes now, I was due over $1,600 prior to inputting my 1099-G and 1099-$ after putting them in I know owe over $3,000.

Is there any way I can move the Roth IRA back into a traditional IRA within Ameritrade, or even use that Roth IRA funds to pay the taxes am I just screwed?

I work in hospitality sales and due to the pandemic, I lost a lot of salary as well as commission/bonuses over the last year. When I made the move I was fully employed, in a position to pay the tax on the retirement fund moves, but now I currently am not as I live in a HCOL area and have completely eaten into my savings and now have credit debt for the first time ($5,000). The tax on the unemployment income was also quite a surprise as I thought I had paid it when i opted to have my taxes taken out (obviously the did not take out enough).",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lu2cy8/tax_question_401k_roth_ira_conversion_and/,1614476200.0,0,0,0

706,Keep my money in high-yield checking?,"This is probably a stupid question so don’t be too harsh lol. 

My accounts:

Checking account -
3% APY for up to $15k balance (which I’m nowhere near at the moment)

No monthly fee

Savings account - 
0.25% APY
$300 minimum balance
$5 monthly fee for under $300 balance 

Other than the $300 min balance to avoid the $5 fee on my savings account, it would be benefit me more to keep a majority of my money in my checking account, right? (I use YNAB to categorize my money so there’s no worry of spending money I don’t want to spend.)

This year I've managed to pay off $3000 of $20K in cc debt, and I have a solid trajectory to pay off all of it this year, but Ill be having to go into work twice a week starting in April and Ill need a car. 

I have $2500 for a down payment and want to finance $10K and then put about 3-500/mo towards the payments to have a paid off car and save on interest (I make around 70K a year, this should be easy) and then I can quickly flip around and go back to focusing exclusively on my credit card debt.  Getting a $10K~ car too Im hoping it will be a little bit more reliable than getting something 3-5K that I can buy in cash, I'd like to keep this car for 4-5 years till I get my credit back in order and get a down payment for a house saved up.

Anyways, long winded back story aside.... How can I shop around for car loans without dinging my credit a bunch?

Step 1: Check if your employer does this via paper or online

Step 2: Complete a new Form W-4 online or via paper as follows:

Check (online) or enter (paper) your personal information (line 1(a) and (b) on Form W-4)

Select Single or Married filing separately filing status (line 1(c) on Form W-4)

Enter $0 for credits and other reductions to annual withholding (Line 3 on Form W-4 is already pre-filled). This is an annual amount by which to reduce withholding below the standard withholding that would be withheld from each paycheck for this job if lines 3 through 4(c) of the Form W-4 were blank or zero.

If using a paper form sign and date it
Step 3: Submit this new information to your employer as soon as 
possible

My husband and I are working on relocating from New Jersey to Maine, hopefully this summer with my elderly mother. Due to my mother's illness complicating  we had no choice but to sell our home (January 2021) closed on our home and move in with her to provide care. 

We have paid off a bulk of our debt and just have remaining two auto loans that we are up to date on (never have been late) and we put the rest into savings. For us to drop down to one income *(my husband's income, I will have no choice but to stay home with my mother to provide care)* and live comfortably while starting our own family  we have decided to relocate to Maine as it is a bit more affordable for us comparatively (NJ Taxes are insane) and still on the East Coast. 

We have decided it would be best to purchase a home ahead of time and slowly transition to ME while working on selling my mother's home in NJ, finding doctors in the areas and move up basically little by little to allow my husband to job search in the area with a bit more ease. Plus this way we have a cushion should the house sell quicker than anticipated, we don't have to buy/close which is a nightmare. 

We we purchased our house 3 years ago... it was way easier. We were able to visit a few houses, found one we loved, place an offer and then meet with a mortgage broker who helped us with our loan. This time around we need pre-approval letters before even seeing properties *(covid restrictions)* and before I start on the 45 day loan quoting adventure, I'd like to figure out a little more information. 

I have visited credible, used nerd wallet and checked out Churchill mortgage, three places given to me to check out but again, I am really new at finding a mortgage loan despite not being new to the home buying process so I have some trepidation.

Our credit scores are in the excellent bracket (my husband) and very good (me) and we had zero issue the first time qualifying for our 30 year mortgage with a bit lesser credit score and we have $32k for our 20% and $6k saved for closing etc.. and growing. We are looking at a house no more than $155k but the one we're interested in is $145K which would make our loan $113K. 

My questions: 

1. Am I allowed to include my mother's retirement income & social security income with my husband's income when we apply for mortgages since she will be living with us and her income will be going towards the household ""pot"" 
2. Would it be worth finding a local mortgage broker to help with this issues or would we be able to use a local mortgage broker in our current state? 
3. Has anymore moved to Maine from out of state? What did you do? Any advice?

735,Asset Allocation in HSA Accounts,"Opening up an HSA this year and curious how others go about investing in this vehicle. I am in my 20's so all of my other accounts (401k, brokerage, IRA) are \~ 95% equities to allow for maximum growth. But with something like an HSA in which I will likely need the money here and there I would assume this would be too aggressive of an approach?

I'm leaning towards something like 60/40 equity to bonds. 40% VTI, 20% VXUS, 20% BND, 20% BNDX.

**Would love to hear others thoughts on if and how their HSA investments differ from other accounts.**

Also: I do know many people do an ""advanced"" technique in which they actually don't use the funds in the HSA in the short-term. Let it compound and then pay for medical advances down the line. My understanding is say that I got eye surgery for 5k tomorrow, I can pay out of pocket now and then reimburse myself in 2030. Obviously if I were to do that then a more aggressive approach would likely be fine. But for sake of simplicity, lets say I actually WOULD use the money for health expenses here and there.

One more thing. I eat well. Hit the gym 5 days per week. Healthy body fat. I don't foresee myself having high medical expenses due to chronic disease anytime soon. Just random stuff or obviously disasters.

737,Mistake getting Vanguard Mutual Fund through Merrill Edge?,"Very new to investing so very much learning as I'm going. I had 401k money sitting around doing nothing with Merril Edge through an old employer. After weeks of researching I just decided to pull the trigger and rollover my 401k with ME.

I then purchased Vanguard's 2060 Target Date fund. I knew it had a $19.95 and that it would have been cheaper to buy the ETF equivalent of the fund but just wanted to get this initial investment over and done with.

I then set it up so I put in a specific amount of money into my IRA every paycheck. What I didn't realize is that my IRA contributions after the initial investment doe not automatically get invested into the Mutual Fund. I have to pay $19.95 all over again for the tiny contribution to my Fund. ME has automatic investment plans but only for certain funds. I misunderstood what automatic investment plan meant before getting this far.

Now I'm thinking it would have been better to just rollover and do everything through Fidelity vs ME. Would it be smart to transfer my IRA to Fidelity. I would get their Target Date Fund not Vanguard. I presume I have to sell my Vanguard fund before I can move the IRA.

Or would a quicker easier solution be to sell the mutual fund then buy Vanguard's VTI ETF then put in the effort to learn how to re-balance it every few years. ETF purchases are free on ME. I could obviously just move over to Vanguard as well or I guess make a large lump payment later. That would be the worst laziest option.

I'm 23, looking to move/rent an apartment further away from the city, which will require me to have a car to get to work. I know little about budgeting, finance, and how I should approach big investments in my life such as previously listed. 

I put away about 1k per paycheck (give or take depending on what happens) and have about \~10k saved up (not including 2k for emergency funds). I currently rent  max $900 including utilities/month and $60/month for public transportation. My credit score is good ( not sure if I can disclose this information?).

My main problem: I don't know how much I can spend while still living comfortably + still saving ""adequately"". (side problem: what is an adequate amount to save?? How much is it to live comfortably???).  I make \~3.6k/month. Also, what's the max renting fee/ car note fee I should be taking on? 

I know it's not smart to buy a car before applying for rent because it drops your credit score, but some sites say that it takes about 30 days for it to reflect on my score so it's ok(?) to buy a few days/ a week before getting my application accepted. On top of the car note, I know I have to pay for insurance (idk if this is the right place to ask, but how much should I expect to pay?), and other things. How much should I have saved for emergency fixes? Does that tap into the 2k emergency fund or is that only for medical?

Renting: I know there are rent calculators, but it still doesn't give me peace. Some calculators tell me I can spend upwards to 1.4k for rent and still have \~1.9k to save/spend. Of course, that's independent to other expenses, but I think that's too much to live comfortably? (I know I don't have to spend that much). I know there are also ""hidden costs"" and need to save up for any security deposits/ month payments upfront some places have. Do I need to get renter's insurance? How much do you guys pay for renters insurance?

Can you guys give me examples from your life and give me a breakdown of your budgets and how you handle it?

The mortgage on the home has been completely paid off, I drive a company vehicle and we own my wife’s car. There is no other debt. Combined income of about 260K - of which 210K comes from my job (husband). We have one child, he’s 23, graduated college and he’s got a 70K job. 

I’ve been with same employer for 5 years and I just got promoted which will put out annual income at $350K. It’s a family owned business, super healthy and stable and if I want, I suspect I will be there for the rest of my working life. 

The new job is “remote” so it doesn’t matter where I live. This allows us to do what we always wanted - move south. We’ve tentatively settled on Nashville and escape those harsh Chicago winters and no state tax in TN doesn’t hurt too much either. 

Our plan is to purchase a home in Nashville but keep our paid off home. Our son will live in it - and will cover majority of taxes and insurance and his own bills. Compared to his current lease, it would save him money and would allow him to save for his own future down payment. 

Benefit for us is clearly that someone we know and trust is in the property. It also a gives us a place to stay for a night or two when visiting friends or family in town. 

Once he’s ready, we’d sell the paid off home and likely pay off most of our home in Nashville or invest.  If sold, house would go for somewhere around 300K I assume. 

I’d like to put about 125K down on the new home and make a good dent while we have a mortgage but since we’re not selling, I don’t just have the 125K just laying around.

767,Sued by Bank of America for Credit Card Debt,"I'd appreciate any advice on this; this is my first lawsuit and it's pretty jarring/stressful. I realize this is a grave I dug but I am actively trying to fix things and have already settled some accounts.

**DISCLAIMER:** I know some will refer to r/legaladvice but I wanted to post here as well to get a larger pool of opinions.

I'm a single male, late twenties, and live in Florida. In late 2018 I suddenly lost my decently paying job and went through some personal family issues. I don't have any familial support and thus fell behind on quite a few payments. Many accounts went to collections, including the BoA credit card account in question where I owe $3.4k.

A few days ago I received a court summons for pretrial dated for appearance in mid May; they attached statements showing the balance and my name. I've done some research and know that I have to respond to the complaint within 20 days, and I plan to do so to avoid judgment, but I've read that if I tackle this soon enough then I can come to a settlement. I've regained employment since that time, earn 60k, and have been working on whittling this all my already sizeable debt down (personal loans, auto, student, past collections accounts all add up to at least 60-70k.)

So the day right after, I call the firm representing BoA, Cooling & Winter LLC. The gentleman asked my mailing address, name, DOB, which disturbed me based from what I've read but if they sent me mail before and delivered summons; they probably already knew this. However, what I **didn't** answer was when he asked for my last 4 SSN, current income, and dollar amounts to debts/financial obligations like child support ect. He would not offer a settlement amount as he stated ""I need to provide my client with a reason for settlement"". I declined to answer and just threw out my first offer at settlement, $.20 on the dollar and simply said that I can't afford the full balance after considering the other accounts I have to settle still, my current income, and living expenses.

I made this offer based off advice David Ramsey gave to a guy in a very similar situation (FL resident; BoA wants 3.7k, law firm refused settlement, summoned to court). C&W rep bluntly declined. The conversation pretty much ends with him saying the full balance is due, they can arrange a payment plan, or simply go to court. I don't have the full balance and paying 3.4+ their fees over 5 years doesn't sound like a good decision.

Ramsey advised the other FL guy to go ahead and show up to mediation and state to the judge/attorney/mediator ""I offered to settle and they declined"" and then it would be settled right then and there.

So that's my current plan: 1) Call C&W on Monday, state that I know my rights under FDCPA, and that before I file my response to the court for pretrial/mediation I wanted to reach out and see if I can discuss settlement, ideally with a different individual. 2) If settled great. If not then I show up to pretrial.

\------------------------------------------------------------

And that's where my trail ends; thanks for reading this far. Did I approach this in a faulty way? Is my plan of action faulty? Should I just pay the full balance on payments? Bankruptcy?

My manager approached me about 4 months ago. The statuse of my taxes had been changed. I not sure why, or how- I didn't even know this could happen. But, they assured me that if I ""fixed"" it everything would be fine. I had to google what a tax hold was, and was unease, but was convinced I fixed the problem- even though I just plugged in a bunch of 1's and zero's. I DIDN'T and still DON'T understand any of it! 

Welp, I started fileing taxes, expecting to get
$2,000 like in the past. That's how much I owe! Ashamed to admit it, but I was also a bit careless with my credit card too- I planned to pay everything off with the tax return. So, I'm 4,000 in the hole- which isn't awful, but the worst I ever been. 

With time, I can easily pay it off, but I just want to know- WHAT THE HELL? I almost never check my pay stubs, a combination of dreading seeing taxes taken, and everything switching to paperless midyear. I don't know my login. Monye was direct deposited and I just blindly believed  I was being paid correctly, and assumed the increase - due to the tax hold- was due to my new promotion. I've never seen a single document verifying that my wage was even raised!

I know I am to blame here, but...Why isn't there a signature required for this? Can my fileing statues really be changed without my permission? Has this happened to anyone?

769,HOA Common Charges I don't owe in collection! Help!,"A little backstory...

In 2008 I purchased a condo at the height of the market before the housing collapse, and the fallout of the market combined with questionable HOA decisions left the value of my condo in particular severely underwater.....

Facing a bad job loss and a new job that didn't pay as well as the old job put my mortgage severely in arrears to the point combined with the fact that my unit is underwater, I decided to cut my losses and give the property back to the bank.

So In Sept 2020 I finished negotiations with my servicer and signed the property over to the bank and I can finally put this behind me....

Or so I thought....

For a couple months after I signed over the property I continued to get bills for the common charges from the property management company.

When I called them they basically told me ""oops, our bad, we won't send you anymore bills"" this was about 3 months ago, and they did indeed stop sending me bills.

Fast forward to today....

I received a letter in the mail from the HOAs law firm demanding the back payment of $2900 in common charges and legal fees for the back common charges for the time I haven't even owned the property!

I'm at my wits end at this point....

This property has been a huge drain on me emotionally and financially and I just want it out of my life...

What can I do?

A few more things that night help...

The HOA fees were current up to the date I signed over the property.

On my mortgage companies end, all is good as far as they're concerned. The mortgage has been forgiven in full and received a 1099 in the mail for the forgiven debt with the property listed on it.....",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ltxo4c/hoa_common_charges_i_dont_owe_in_collection_help/,1614461039.0,1,1,0

773,"New Job, New Salary ... same perpetual treading of water.","So, I could use words of encouragement and perhaps a suggestion or two at the moment.

Just signed an offer sheet that bumped my pay from $34,000 annually to $57,480 (both pre-tax). I've been trying to put together a five year financial plan and am realizing that I'm just not going to hit the goals I'm shooting for.

I met the love of my life two years ago and want to propose this summer ($1000 for a ring goal). Then there's saving for the wedding ($8000 goal due in 14 months-ish). I have no family help to pay for that. May be compromising on that price tag, I imagine. I have a leased vehicle that's coming due in October that I'm budgeting roughly $2,000 on between mileage overages, repairs and fees. Then that leaves me needing to budget for the next vehicle in order to get to my new job 30 miles away. Lastly, saving for the gold-standard 20% down on a home with a due date of roughly 2-years out. Oh yeah ... I'm 33 and she's 35. Kids are in our near future as well. $60,000 in student loans return to accumulating interest in September. Still trying to populate emergency funds and retirement savings too. Travel? Not likely. 

On the one hand, it's helpful to have it all laid out (even if imperfectly). On the other hand, it's discouraging to see that my goals aren't really realistic. I imagine the major compromises are in the ring, wedding costs, and the home downpayment. I really don't want to go back into more debt with another lease when my vehicle comes due, but I don't see myself saving enough for a purchase at that point.

Should I just buy a stepping stone condo/townhome and then rent it out later (5 years) and buy a 2nd real house?

Or should I just get a nice house right with 3.5% down away and take the PMI hit. I can cross my fingers my house value rises and I will be trying to hit that 20% equity ASAP to get rid of PMI.

My university can fully reimburse the tuition for the months that I will not be a student.

However, I did spend money on my 529 for room and board, and necessary school supplies (laptop) that won't be able to be refunded. I'm asking if anyone knows whether I will take a penalty from my 529 withdrawals since I will no longer be a student.

794,Fidelity Fraud Team asking for Proof of Address - Accidentally used PO Box address,"My Fidelity account is locked and has $7000 in there so I'm doing my best to unlock my account.

Fidelity asked for my identity, bank statements, and proof of address.

My PO Box has a physical address attached to it, so I've been using my PO Box physical address for everything since I just live with a friend and pay them cash every month.

Usually when companies ask for my proof of address, my bank statement or car insurance with suffice. I've faxed that over to Fidelity and they verified my identity and bank statements but they said **they strictly need a gas/electric/rent bill for proof of address and for me to confirm my account and to unlock it.**

I don't know what to do, and I'm wondering if I should just tell them straight up that I accidentally used my PO Box physical address as my address, but I don't want them to close my account and take my money. I'm not going to do anything illegal as well like forging a bill as it could get me in legal trouble.

My current plan is to wait until I get a new address where I actually pay the bills, then go to a local Fidelity office to show them I changed my address with the corresponding bills to back it up. It might be a few months to a year from now until I'll have a place of my own though.

Also, because of covid and the current stock situation now, it might be best to lay low for now.

Is it even legal for them to keep my money indefinitely? Does anyone else have the same experience or advice? Please help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ltdu89/fidelity_fraud_team_asking_for_proof_of_address/,1614392017.0,23,23,0

He has about 300k in student loans and I have 65k. Our interest rate is around 6-7% as the majority are in grad plus loans. Our 5 year goal is to pay off all our loans by using my salary for living costs and for all of his salary to be used on rent/mortgage and student loans.

We are looking for a 3bd/3bath townhome/single home and the rent seems to cost around 2500-3000 for a home that size which is a newer build. The average home costs seems to be around 350-400k for the same type of home. If we do buy a home we are planning to keep this home as rental income as the area is a pretty desired neighborhood with more demand for rentals than supply.

We currently have most of our savings in our retirement fund, and about 20k in stocks. The biggest problem is that we don't have any cash saved (besides stocks) as we were living on his resident salary for the initial 3 years while I was going through immigration and grad school. So if we were to buy, we would need to be able to have the lowest downpayment possible.

We honestly don't care if we have to rent or buy, so what would be the most financially savvy decision?

799,Help planning employment exit strategy in high stakes situation.,"I need some help. 

Earlier this year I was fortunate enough to learn that the company I have been working for may soon have an IPO, and my employee stock options vesting at the end of October will be worth 200k+ depending on how the stock moves. Then, earlier this month, I learned my application to a full scholarships for a master's degree I applied to at the beginning of 2020, which had been twice delayed and eventually cancelled (or so I thought) due to the coronavirus was now back on, with my school wanting me to start... at the beginning of October.

Planning my exit from my company is rapidly becoming a nightmare. I applied to the scholarship early 2020 before corona, before I ever began working at my company. I had planned to study in 2020 originally but when I realized the pandemic would keep me from going back to school I started at my company instead. I was then told the scholarship was cancelled because of coronavirus travel bans with no further information. There was no way for me to plan any of this smoothly. 

Ive been told I absolutely cannot delay the start date of the scholarship past October 1st as due to the pandemic it was already delayed from starting in April of last year. Asking for a deferral or reneging the scholarship blacklists me from reapplying for 6 years and Ill need to retake entrance examinations and interviews. 

On one hand, I can probably ask for pto at the start of my school year and give notice during the pto at the end of october to insure Im not terminated until my stock vests. But doing this would likely completely burn the bridge with my company which I actually really like and they are becoming super successful. I want to return to them after school if I can. 

On the other hand, Im afraid that coming clean and telling my employer what is going on by mid September when we would have time to plan a compromise, would risk me being fired as a flight risk since I am in a right to work state and Ill lose my stock options if Im terminated early with or without cause.

Then, on the side of my school, Im scared to tell my thesis advisor the truth, because he is already putting his neck on the line with the scholarship committee trying to hold my spot open, just for me to tell him no or delay so I can cash out? I dont know how to tell him or if I should, it would look really bad. 

Ill keep trying, but if my school will not budge on the start date, should I just tell my company the truth? There's both potentially life changing money and a valuable opportunity on the line. Honestly at a loss about what to do.

800,What to Do With Old Life Insurance Policy,"I have this old Northwestern Mutual life insurance policy that my dad set up when I was a baby. A 65 life plan. I’m 37 now.

I’m trying to get all my financial stuff simplified, and this is a policy that he signed over to me when I became an adult but have never done a thing with and would like to simplify by getting rid of it if it makes sense to do so.

The policy is $25,000 and with dividends has a total death benefit of 68,000, minus about 2,000 for loans taken on policy (I’ve been letting it ride for the fees/premiums and whatnot letting it take from the policy rather than mess around with it and sending in checks... perhaps the wrong way to do it, but it has been easy). Cash value is about 17,000.

It would be a nice chunk of change for my family were I to die (I have 3 kids and a non working spouse), but I don’t technically NEED it since I also have life insurance through my employer in the neighborhood of about 250,000.

Essentially, were you me, what would you do with the policy? Cash it out for the cash value and be done with it, or stop ignoring it and keep up the premiums and pay off the loan it’s riding and maintain it as a policy? Advantages to either? Knowing that my primary goal is simplicity, but I don’t want to give away something valuable ONLY for simplicity.

We just opened up a Roth IRA with Vanguard and set up to move over $12,000 from her Chase Savings. $6k for 2020 and another for 2021. She'll probably just put all of it in VTSAX from what I can see.

Not that I have any other options to get the match, but I feel fairly comfortable with it (as much as I can, knowing as little as I do). My co-workers have been happy with their gains, and my boss has used him for decades. He is aggressive with his investments. For example, some of the paperwork he laid out compared his model vs the market. Saying while mutual funds are a part of it, he does invest in individual stocks highly and makes moves when the market dips or stagnates. It's hard to know who to trust, and what to believe being as new to all this as I am. He's willing to meet frequently and go over my account, answer any Q's, etc. Anything I should look out for here moving forward?

824,Restricted Stock Units taxed at vesting and upon sale,"I'm fortunate to work for a successful company that gives me restricted stock units (RSUs) each year and each year some of the RSUs vest. When the RSUs vest, some of the stock is sold to cover taxes.

1) Opening a brokerage account w/ Vanguard, begin investing in ETFs only, and both save up the $3000 and transfer some of the earnings to my Roth IRA, emergency fund, & HSA

2) Opening a brokerage account somewhere else, begin investing in mutual/index/ETFs, and transfer some of the earnings to Roth IRA, emergency fund, & HSA

Fast forward 14 years and I am ready to sell and get something larger.

The issue is in order for her to give me the proceeds would be in the form of a gift which would be taxed. My question is, if I am added to the deed now, and we sold it this year, would I fall into the same situation as I wouldn't need to claim the proceeds from the sale since it would be under $250,000 (studio worth around $130,000) and lived there the whole time?

I don't have any credit cards and this is currently what is mainly generating my credit score (from what I understand, which to be fair isn't much, but that's why I'm here).

I heard that getting the loan refinanced can really help if you're money situation changes, or if the interest rates get lower. So I was wondering if that is something I should look into.

847,"Help me fire my ""wealth"" manager","Hey hive mind. How's it going.

Some years ago a family member passed away. Their assets (read: house) were liquidated and distributed to the heirs. My part was placed into a trust until I turned 40. Yes, forty years of age. In the meantime another family member (dad) was responsible for managing this money. Dad is fairly hands off with investing and managing money and so he used a ""wealth"" management firm to manage this money. When the trust dissolved I was too busy to figure this out and signed paperwork to keep the money invested with this firm. I believe my father has all or most of his finances managed by this firm and thus the fee structure maybe made sense. But when you consider my part on its own it doesn't. Also I am underwhelmed with the firm. They don't seem to be doing enough for what they charge.

I am normally a huge fan of low-cost index funds. I have a vaguely ""boglehead"" 3-fund approach for my other investments. It is mostly set-and-forget. I rebalance 2-4 times a year. I am not an avid trader.

Also most of my savings is in tax shelters (IRAs, etc). I am not used to dealing with capital gains taxes.

This firm has my inheritance invested in more than a dozen individual stocks and some corporate bonds and what looks like a CD ladder. Some of the stocks have been held for over a decade and have some size-able gains.

How do I go about efficiently transitioning these funds from the active and expensive management to a cheaper, more set-and-forget, hands off DIY approach?

My plan:

1. Write a letter notifying them that I wish to terminate my use of their services
2. Call the firm where the investment account they manage is at (TD) and figure out what paperwork I need to transfer these assets into my own personal investment account. When I ""hired"" these guys there was some (TD) paperwork go give them control of the account. I assume there is equivalent paperwork to take that control away. I assume TD customer support can help me with this
3. Let the bonds and CDs mature. As they do, use the proceeds to buy VBTLX or equivalent
4. Start selling individual stocks.. sell the losers and an equivalent amount of the winners to offset the capital losses. Not sell anything held short-term (<1 year). Buy VTSAX/VTIAX as appropriate
5. Consider selling more winners as our appetite for long-term cap-gains taxes permit
6. Repeat step 4 2-4x per year. Expect that I may hold some of the individual stocks until retirement/whatever
7. Enjoy not paying for poorly rendered services I'll never, ever use

851,"US-based student for half the year, living abroad in Korea for the other half after having graduated... how the heck do I file my US taxes?","I've tried looking online to see if anyone else was in a similar boat, but I'm such an edge case that nothing I was able to find online really seemed to apply to me. The fact that 2020 is the year of COVID-19 makes things a bit more complicated as well. So let me get started.

I'm 22 years old. My parents are both US citizens and residents. I'm a US citizen too, but I also have Korean nationality, and my US residence is set to my parents' residence. Last November for the election I requested an absentee ballot sent to me in Korea. I ended up voting for the election of the state and precinct of my parents' residence, so this demonstrates that my residence is still set there.

My final semester in the United States began at the end of January. For about a month I lived in one house, and for the following month I lived in another house. I didn't change my legal residence. After the March 2020 coronavirus scare hit, I went back to my parents' place and stayed there until the semester ended. I soon after packed my bags and flew here to Korea at the beginning of June, staying  and living alone until the rest of the year (and up to the present).

I then began studying for my masters at a Korean university. As aforementioned I also have Korean nationality and so I'm enrolled under my Korean identity, i.e. the US doesn't have my current school enrollment on record. I have multiple Korean bank accounts, am earning money from the school as part of a research program, and do food delivery in order to earn money on the side (think something like UberEats). All of this money is going to my Korean bank account, but back when I opened the bank accounts I was required to indicate that I am a US taxpayer; I'm pretty sure this means that the IRS has some record of the money I make in Korea.

So with my background explained, here are my questions:

**Eligibility to be claimed as a dependent.** Even though I'm 22, no matter how you slice it I lived abroad and not with my parents for over six months in 2020 despite my US residence being set to theirs. Does any of this matter, and am I unable to be claimed as a dependent?

852,Should I use credit cards for monthly expenses I have but paying them off in full each month in order collect CC incentives.,"I will be debt free by end of summer and have been toying with the idea of putting most of, if not all my monthly expenses on a couple of credit cards in order to reap the benefits of cash back, points towards Amazon purchases, travel, etc. 

The monthly expenses I’d consider putting on credit cards would be internet service, fuel, online streaming services, and groceries just to name a few.

Is this a plausible idea? 

When setting up the autopay to clear the balance in full every month, how many days in advance should I schedule the payments to avoid interest charges? Can I avoid interest charges?

853,Made the mistake of going with a debt settlement company. Where do I go from here?,"I started a debt settlement program 3/27/20 thinking I was going to better my credit card debt situation but I was completely wrong. After a year into the program and realizing it was a mistake, I'm trying to see what you guys would do in my situation.

Prior to enrolling, I had racked up around $15k in credit card debt between 5 creditors and felt like I was drowning. I was able to make minimum payments on time every month but it felt like I was throwing my money away and that the card balances would just never drop. I signed up for a debt settlement program, one where they essentially let your accounts go delinquent while you make payments into an escrow account that the company uses when they reach a ""settlement"" with your creditor. This has cost me a ton in extra fees and a major drop/damage to my credit score. Granted, I am the one to blame for not doing my research prior to getting into this.

The program as of today has reached settlements on 3/5 accounts (1 paid off/closed and 2 being paid off with structured monthly payments from the escrow account). The other 2 have higher balances and a settlement has still not been reached. I checked on [annualcreditreport.com](https://annualcreditreport.com) and saw that 4/5 of the cards were charged off and unable to be removed until February/March 2027.

I realize a lot of the damage is already done and probably can only be fixed with time, but is there anything I can do as damage control to possibly better my situation? I see people mentioning different things such as contacting creditors or collection agencies directly, or sending pay for delete letters.

I appreciate any insight you guys have so thank you in advance. Let me know if there is any other information you guys may need.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lsplyq/made_the_mistake_of_going_with_a_debt_settlement/,1614312810.0,485,485,0

I recently received a bonus from work and now that our emergency savings is built up I'd like to put this bonus towards either our student loans or remaining car loan.

The interest on the student loan is about 5% while the car is 2.5%. The monthly payments are nearly identical.

My wife and I (mid 20s) have been together for almost six years, and in that time we’ve accumulated $62,000 in credit card debt and loans. The monthly payments on these debts accounts for over half of our expenses. We fortunately own our home and have a roommate to help with mortgage and utility expenses, but we’re still barely breaking even.

After all bills are paid we normally have approximately $600 each pay period for groceries, gas, food for our pets and other various expenses. My wife recently purchased a new car due to hers dying, and mine is getting up in age. I’m concerned that if we need to add another car payment to our debt that it’ll finally put us at a breaking point.

We’re looking to meet with a financial advisor, and I fully don’t trust any debt settlement company to handle things responsibly. I’ve floated the idea of chapter 13 bankruptcy, but that would obviously come as a really solid hit to our credit.

858,Where can I improve financially - looking for advice!,"Hello all,

I am resubmitting my post with updates due to my previous one not gaining any traction. I'm a 25 year old who recently moved to a city near the San Francisco area making \~$70,000/year.

Gross income: $6,000/month

401K contributions: 20% pretax; 5% Roth

Rent + utilities: $1250 + \~$150 

My take-home is in the ballpark of $1600-$1800 biweekly. Each paycheck I subtract 50% of my rent + utilities cost and allocate the remaining balance accordingly:

80% investment/savings; 10% groceries; 10% wants. The current allocation allows me to put a investment and savings (\~$750-$800) into my Roth IRA for 2021.

I have mixed feelings about how I'm living currently:

&#x200B;

\- I don't have a car and I feel that by getting one, I won't feel stranded at home. I'd plan on getting a used Toyota - nothing fancy. To counter, I moved into a big city (with relatively okay public transportation) in the middle of the pandemic. Everyone is feeling stranded at the moment.

\- I would eventually like to find a studio (in the range of $1800-$2100) because I really prefer to have my own space and not deal with roommates. To counter, I would need to heavily reduce my current investment strategy.

&#x200B;

I believe I'm in a funk of saving that I'm not actually living. COVID doesn't help my situation whatsoever. I'd like to hear your thoughts on how I could improve. Getting a car and the studio would be ideal, but my savings and investments would drop significantly.

862,Got Myself Out of Debt But Will Have to Go Back Into Debt,"As the title implies I just got off from debt and will have to dive back into debt. I am writing this post to look for suggestions.
In by the end of 2018 I took out a 4k loan because my mother needed laser surgeries on her legs out of state. Soon after at the beginning of 2019, my car broke down. I only had 2k and the cars that were affordable in my area required some kind of repair I could not afford. In desperation to get my mom's surgeries out of state, I went to a dealership to get a ""good"" running vehicle and used the 2k as a down payment. I got myself into a 2 year contract of $600 monthly payment with the car dealership for a total payment of 10k + plus interest. 
Soon after in like a month I began to have transmission problems. I tried to return the car but they only gave me the option to exchange the car for a higher car payment. I was stressed out of going back and forth with the dealership I just decided to pay it off.
In within a year of getting my mom's surgery loan I paid it off, mostly myself with my mom's help here and there. In a 1 year and 4 months I paid off my car.
Unfortunately a month after paying off the car my transmission gave in. I had saved up about 1k for emergency and I had used it all in within that month for a new car battery and a radiator.
I honestly do not want to get into another car payment, but it looks like my only option. I do not have a reliable person to take me back and forth from work, public transit will take me about 1hour to make it to work and going back home there will be no public transit because I come out at night. I even thought about getting a moped instead, but I am scared of those things. I've been making it to work and home by taking Lyfts, Uber and taxis but it is quite expensive.
An idea I thought about earlier was to get a 7k loan from the bank and get a 4k - 5k car and use the rest for the insurance and any maintenance it needs to make sure the car is okay. 
Any other suggestions?

Edit: When I took the car to the mechanic, spent all this money to fix the car and it still doesn't work.
Within a minute of getting the car back after replacing the radiator, I had a check engine light. The next day it wouldn't start. I took it back to the mechanic twice and in the end they said there is nothing they can do unless I decide to change the entire transmission.

2nd Edit: The last of the money I used to fix my car was the last I had saved up as an emergency fund, so I have no money at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ltnzcr/got_myself_out_of_debt_but_will_have_to_go_back/,1614431996.0,0,0,0

For reference, I am a 21yo girl from Europe (Italy) who works online and I can make decent money (from 800-2000 euro per month)

Initially I made very bad money and I had 500ish euro saved from gifts etc

In the first months I made between 35-350 per months, then +500 euro then it got over 800 euro.

The best month was december along with january 2020 where I passed 1500 euro.

February was rather sucky for multiple reasons but honestly this job is very volatile, one day you make 300 euro the next 3,95 euro and you have stfu.

I have around 5k saved atm but I received several gifts from Xmas and birthday too. I don't pay rent and I stay in a property apartment, but I am saving to officially move.

I started therapy in december, I had to buy new stuff for the apartment then for my job, bought btc, new clothes etc plus the therapy and it got over 2k. I checked and it seems insane but it was since last june / july though.

I bought also a new phone and a Nintendo Switch, 40ish for my nintendo shop and pay 7,99 per month for my phone bill.

I had to buy a new vacuum and accidentally bought a new iron despite having it at home already (yes I am dumb and didn't check properly).

I have many things in mind but now I lead a very boring life tbh Uni is like 1000 euro per year plus extras, therapy is 70 per hour so around 140-280 euro per month, plus I had to pay for the vet for my cat and soon medical bills and some uni fees.

I don't go out much and here I hate the place because it is so boring and dull without considering the coronavirus restrictions.

I want to move but my job experience is literally none and I have to finish schools and do certifications first for languages etc so my CV doesn't suck. I literally have very luckluster options now if I move and I have no idea where, I am doing a careful research.

&#x200B;

I use a Kakebo to track what I earn and spend everyday and week per category monthly.

Do I need a reality check? Again no rent, just school bills, medical bills ot therapy, grocery shopping, occasional book shopping, things for the house etc

Also my parents and family don't want me to pay any bills and offer to pay instead (dad, grandma mostly but it is just how they are), I asked them to pay rent too so I can have more space (it is literally a property apartment owned legally by them) but they don't want my money and they know about my job.

So usually you would use your debit card number on a transfer app or web service and instant deposit to another debit card with a different bank, however, the bank I need to take money out of ***does NOT have a debit card***, and again there are no branches anywhere near by area.

Also the bank I need to get the money from does not have built-in transfer options like Zelle (and the app version doesn't support the bank either) so that's out.

**SO IN SUMMARY,** 

I need some sort of app or website, or service that will allow me to move money SPECIFICALLY using my bank account (account and routing number) to my other bank (which does have a debit card) preferably the same day.

If anyone has any ideas I greatly appreciate it. I need to get access to the funds as quick as possible, preferably today but the bank I need to get the funds from does not have any built-in transfer service like Zelle or a debit card.

One who can do queries, know DAX, Javascript, T-SQL, MY-SQL, VBA, create Dashboards in PowerBI and combine the data from our multiple systems. I realized I was indispensable. Each one of these coding languages is required for what I do. My company would have to hire 1 very expensive person or multiple people to fill the roles in which I do right now.

They just lost someone who was arguably the only other person who could do what I do in the company.  So here is my question

I do not want to leave but I am obviously unhappy with this massive pay gap difference. I'm not exaggerating when I say $30K to 50K under industry standard right now. And I'm probably low-balling it for my skill set.  I feel grossly underappreciated for all the years of blood, sweat and tears I've poured out into this company.  I have updated my resume, did some job searching this week and got a few hits for companies at least $15K higher right now.  I know I could do a lot better. A LOT better given time and patience.

What I'm asking is, I'm obviously not good at valuing my self worth or I would not be in this mess to begin with. How should I approach my boss that I want a salary increase?  Here is what is going for me

Pros

* Previous Emp role has not been filled. Not going to happen for some time if at all. So they have the budget to play with.
* Without me, this company could not function. They know it after the scare of losing Prev Emp.
* They know they have been grossly under paying me for years. My position started out as X, now I'm doing XYZ,ABC,EFG,HIJ,KLM, etc.
* Nobody to replace me that knows the multiple systems like I do. It would take years to train/get up to speed.

Cons

* Business has been in a slump since Oct. Second Covid wave is really hurting our bottom line.
* They might call my bluff as there are VPs/management who would like nothing better than see me go.
* I'm too nice. I stand my ground but when it comes to my self worth, they might not give me what they owe me for all the years they under paid me.

880,Is it normal for bank to ask for photos of my social security card?,"

I’m having an elective surgery, and my doctor’s office has a relationship with a bank which offers credit lines to cover procedures with 0% interest for the first 12 months. Great! I went through the pre-approval process online and got pre-approved for almost the whole cost of my surgery. Awesome. So I applied and the bank said I’d get something in the mail with my official answer.

Meanwhile, surgeries are booking out in advance and I need to at least cover the surgical fees to reserve a date. It’s 2k out of pocket, but now I have my date reserved and am just waiting on the bank. I could pay out of pocket or on other credit cards for the whole thing if I *had* to, but this credit line is a much better idea financially.

Three weeks pass and I am starting to get worried I haven’t heard from the bank. I can’t think of any reason I wouldn’t be approved; my score is higher than their qualifying range and I have good employment.

Today I finally got the letter in the mail — and thank god because my surgery date is approaching fast and I can’t do that without paying. Except, I open the letter and it says that they will “continue processing” my application as soon as I’ve either mailed or emailed scans of my driver’s license, social security card, and my last w-2. 

This is where I came to a screeching halt because 1) there’s no reason they should need a scan of my social security card when they already have the number, and 2) sending photos of it by post or email is laughably insecure.

The bank appears to be both real and insured so I’m sort of at a loss here, because this seems like a scam. Is it normal to be asked to send these documents?

883,Figuring out How to Handle my Deceased Fathers Lease to Own Property.,"Hi all - long time lurker, first time poster. 

My father passed away in December and I’m looking for some advice. He had two properties - one was a cut and dry sell, but the other is a bit more complicated. 

His other property was 10+ acres in the country.  He left it vacant for awhile and it had been pretty badly vandalized. A neighbor was interested in purchasing it, but unable to secure a loan because of the condition of the house. 

Dad made a “gentleman’s agreement” with him. He would have one year to fix up the house and secure a loan to purchase it. He’s paying a monthly payment that will come off the final purchase price. He’s also done A TON of work on the house - basically ripped it down to the studs and started from scratch. I have no reason to doubt that he will purchase it when the time comes based on how much work he’s put into it. As for the neighbor - he’s a very nice guy. He came to my fathers funeral, has been on time with all his payments, and texts me updates about how the house is coming along. Again - no reason to mistrust him at all. 

The original “lease” says the buy option ends in May 2021, but the neighbor told me that dad verbally extended it to May 2022 because of COVID. I believe him and plan on rewriting his lease to account for this. 

Here’s the thing - it is definitely a gentleman’s agreement and I doubt the “lease” would hold up at all should something happen. I have zero landlord experience (is that even what I am in this case?), zero legal background, and just want to make sure I’m not taken advantage of should something happen to him or he decide he wanted to take advantage of the situation. 

When I rewrite the lease, is there anything specific I should be looking include? Also - should I get the title transferred to my name, leave it in my fathers, or transfer it to his estate? 

Any advice on how to approach this would be greatly appreciated. 

For reference - below is the verbiage of the document my father drew up with some things omitted. I’m not even sure I know where a signed copy is.  Please don’t laugh - again, gentleman’s agreement.

I, (the father), am leasing to (the neighbor) the 13 (+) acres I own at (address here) in (city) ,Texas, for $500 per month for one year.

The lease period is from June 1,2020 until May 31,2021. If purchase option is used the sale must close on or before May 31,2021. The property is being leased strictly “as is”.

First off, we are saving for a house and we both currently have working vehicles, granted his isn't in the best condition. Both owned outright, so only paying for insurance each month. Second, I was always told leasing is a terrible idea. You are pouring money into a vehicle and (from my understanding) still have to cover all the maintenance costs. I see zero benefit to leasing unless the dealership is covering the maintenance for free. I was always raised with the mentality of you buy a vehicle and keep it until it gets run into the ground. My family only got rid of vehicles when they literally broke beyond repair or just became too costly to fix anymore. Every family vehicle we had growing up was kept for 10+ years. So I just wanted know, do I have the wrong idea/mindset about leasing? Does it ever make more sense to lease than buy? Pros/cons?

888,"""You'll save money with a solar PPA"". Is this really true over 20 years?","**State**: California

We're currently in escrow for a house with solar PPA through Vivint. The sellers are 4 years into the 20 year contract. Here are the details:

### System Details
**System size**: 9.01 kW DC (35 panels)

**First year estimated production**: 10,229 kWh

**Actual production in 2020 (4th year)**: 9800 kWh

**Estimated peak production in summer**: 1450 kWh

**Peak summer production in 2020**: 1450 kWh

**Estimated lowest production in winter**: 200 kWh

**Peak winter production in 2020**: 200 kWh

**Current rate**: $0.18 per kWh

**Rate escalation**: 2.9% fixed every year

**Battery storage**: No

### PG&E Plan
**Tier 1**: $0.24 per kWh

**Tier 2**: 0.30 per kWh

### House Details
**Area**: 1900 sqft

My wife and I work from home so we'll be using a lot more electricity compared to the sellers or the typical household. On paper, it appears we'll be paying a lower rate than PG&E's Tier 1 for the next 10 years. For the last 10 years, even with the rate escalation every year, we'll be between PG&E's Tier 1 and Tier 2 rate, so it seems still cheaper overall. And we will try to buy the panels in 2 years (earliest allowed) which will cost roughly 20K after which the electricity will be ""free"".

892,Car repossessed advice,"Let me know if this is the wrong subreddit for this.

I am not making the money now that I was making when I signed up for my car loan, and I went a couple months without paying it, so my car got repossessed. 

I borrowed money to pay off my back payments and fee. I figured I could get the car back and then sell it to pay off the car and the other loan.

I made a mistake when I went to pay off what I owed on it though; they said if I paid with a cashier's check in person at the bank I could get the car back within a few days, but I misunderstood and paid with a personal check, which appearently takes 17 days to process. But also, it turns out that the lot it was at was also charging me $25 dollars a day for car storage, and of course I wasn't told this until the day I was going to pick it up. The price they wanted to give the car back to me for was something like six or seven hundred dollars, after those 17 days. 

I cannot express to you how much I do not have that money. I will not have money like that for a long time, unless I finally, magically succeed at finding a better paying job within the week, and even then the price has of course only gone up the longer I've left it there. $25 dollars a day. Its been there almost two months now.

They want all the money up front, all in cash. I'm kind of traumatized at the thought of taking out yet another loan to pay this. It feels like fucky logic to take out a loan to pay a loan to pay a loan. And at this point I feel like it's just going to be another fee they didn't tell me about after another fee they didn't tell me about, and no matter what I do I won't have enough money to get the car back. 

Its only gotten worse sense then. Its been there probably two months now. I shouldn't have done it, but I put off dealing with the car for longer than I should have, because honestly just thinking about this car makes me want to cry at this point. 

I don't know what to do. The place called me and said my car is in a weird limbo they haven't seen before, because they haven't had somebody pay the bank to get the car back, but be unable to pay the storage fees before. 

Should I suck it up and get another loan? I could just not pay my next car loan payments and get it repossessed again, but how does a car get repossessed from a repossession lot? And I don't want two repossessions in my history, if possible, but would that be better?  The lot that has the car said when they called me that I would have to pay the fees no matter what happens with the car, but I literally just can't, I work a minimum wage job thats barely enough for rent electric and groceries and pretty much nothing else. 

I feel like there's got to be some obvious solution to this that I'm just too stressed and anxious to see. Any advice? Outside perspective?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ltde7f/car_repossessed_advice/,1614390601.0,3,3,0

903,Over contributed to 401k. What is the best way to fix this?,"I switched jobs this year. Between the two, I accidentally overcontributed to my separate 401k’s by about $1500. 

I contacted my current employer, and he wants to back out the overage, but he says my 2020 w-2 won’t change. This reversal of the overage will go on my 2021 taxes. 

My understanding is that the proper way to handle this is 

-Back out the excess contribution and any gains on the $1500 overage. 
-Receive a corrected 2020 W-2 from my employer. This will increase my taxable wages by the overage amount
-Pay early withdrawal penalty on any gains that the $1500 has generated. 

Am I correct? My current employer seems to think this will be taken care of on my 2021 W-2, but that doesn’t make sense to me. I would still show an over contribution if I don’t receive a corrected 2020 W-2.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ltggvy/over_contributed_to_401k_what_is_the_best_way_to/,1614401024.0,2,2,0
904,Pulling out investments to pay off credit card debt,"I’m in my mid-20’s and have around $15K in credit card debt. It’s really affecting my credit score and the monthly payments just to maintain that are around $450.

I have a little over $16K in stocks and bonds that I haven’t touched in like ten years and has been growing for a while. 

Should I take that money out of the market to pay off the debt that is costing me almost $500 a month? It certainly isn’t appreciating at that rate.... it’s not in a 401k or anything so there aren’t penalties for pulling it out besides general capital gains afaik.

905,Which account(s) should my money be in for my downpayment? Is a high-yield savings account risky?,"I'm close to being ready to put a down payment down on my first home (YAY!), and I've been socking away my ""house"" money into a high-yield savings account (Wealthfront ""Individual Cash Account"") for the last year. For psychological and practical reasons (higher interest), I've found it helpful to keep my down payment fund in this separate Wealthfront account, and not in my regular checking account.

When it comes time to actually send the money to the bank, do I have to move it back into my checking account to do so? Or can I take it directly out of the Wealthfront account? Does it look sketchy to the bank if I am transferring money between the accounts?

Also, is there any risk of *losing* money by keeping my downpayment in the Wealthfront high-yield savings account? I came across a reddit post of someone losing money by putting it in Wealthfront, but I think they were using it for robo-investing, not high-yield savings.

909,Student Loan Company Scotland Overseas Loan Repayment,"I studied in Scotland and have a large loan from SLC that I used to support my studies while living there.

I have no intention of returning there to work and I now live in the United States. When I first arrived in the US I was making payments but then SLC raised my repayment to a ridiculous amount that I literally could not afford. They had calculated my earning threshold for the nation not the state/ area I live in which is one of the most expensive parts of the country (translation - my salary is actually very low and I struggle to pay bills with it). SLC wanted $350 per month which is insane I can’t even afford a car. 

But I tried contacting them and they asked for a ton of evidence but because I transfer money for bills that come out of other accounts I didn’t know how to provide all this. I was a bit lost then with the pandemic I literally just stopped paying altogether. Now I’m scared to even look at it incase they’ve added arrears balances. 

Are they going to come after me if I wait too long? Does anyone know how this is going to affect me? I wish I could just make a reasonable payment plan.

912,[California] HSA - TD Ameritrade investing worth it?,"Some basic info: husband and me (early 30s), no kids, total income (both of us) \~$100k

I have an HSA through my employer, and I have about $12k in the account right now. I opened a TD Ameritrade account and moved some money into it, but I realized that I needed to actually BUY something, and I didn't.. The money was just in the IDA the whole time. Oof.. (Yeah.. I don't know much about investing but I'm trying to learn.)

Then I found out that in California, you need to report the interest made from HSA investments because CA doesn't recognize HSA ... as an HSA. So I got a little panicked and transferred all the money back into the HSA last year. I have $0.06 left in the Ameritrade account. 

I have a pretty good emergency fund, and my job is secure, so I was planning on leaving the HSA alone until retirement. I have about $9k worth of medical expenses from 2017 to now that I haven't reimbursed myself for yet, so I can transfer that too in case of dire emergency. 

So for next steps.. Does it sound like it would be worth investing as a CA resident?

If so, I was thinking of creating an Auto-Sweep Transfer, leaving $5000 in the HSA. Then, I need to actually BUY something. I was thinking of starting with SPTM, based on research on reddit. Should I diversify a little more or start with one? (SPDW, SPEM, SPAB were the others I saw suggested.)

If I do invest, I just look at my December 2021 statement when doing taxes next year and put in the YTD interest/dividends, right? So it shouldn't be too much extra work?

914,New car or maintenance on beater car?,"91k net income. 
$3,300 leftover after bills and expenses monthly. 

This post is about my 1998 Toyota Camry that is daily driven. My go to car. 188k miles, bought it for $750, I’ve put now about $1500 into since owning it. (Tires, oil changes, water pump, timing belt) it has quite a few oil leaks. But if I do the valve cover gasket, plugs + wires, and new ball joints she’ll be mechanically sound. Approx $200 in parts and I’ll do most (if not all) the labor myself.

Commute to work is 60 miles round trip 

I wanted to really buy myself a nicer car. A 2014 Toyota Prius with 120k on the clock. Better MPG, probably same reliability, and trust in the car. Prius is $8700. My loan is $150.00 for 72 months. 

Financially speaking it’s smarter to just get the Camry up to snuff with maintenance. Flip side is  $150 payment won’t hurt at all. 

What would y’all do?

915,Realistic chances of ownership,"Just wanted some thoughts on my current situation. 

&#x200B;

Currently 24 and living at home with parents(rented place, not owned) with about $20k liquid/invested , no debt, about $40k annual income and a 750 credit score.

&#x200B;

Been thinking of possibly attempting to get a loan to purchase a condo to either rent out or to live and start paying off within the next year or two. I want to own something and I'd personally rather start now rather than wait til I'm 40 to start. Currently studying for LSATs so if I do get into a good law school I'd probably use a loan for that instead since it'd be a better ROI, but just wanted some thoughts on the situation as a whole if it's a good time to do this with interest rates for 30-years being pretty low compared to the previous years and to lock it in soon or not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lt8e9j/realistic_chances_of_ownership/,1614375132.0,6,6,0
916,"Former Life / Health Insurance Agent being asked to repay $3,097 debt. Need help!","From 2019 until the end of 2020, I was a Life / Health Insurance Agent for a company called Washington National. Basically, we were independent contractors / 1099 employees who sold policies to people and made commission off those policies. Our pay was commission only. When customers we signed up canceled their policies, we'd have to pay back the commissions, but not all at once. For example the debt would accumulate, and they'd take small percentages from our paychecks to slowly pay off the debt.  


My contract with that company officially ended in December. And today (Feb 26) a letter was sent to me saying I owed $3,097 and that I was required to pay it back within 10 days. Also, there is no documentation in the letter showing proof that I owe them money. They just told me to go on some website and see for myself. I got a bad feeling about the website, and this letter kinda reeks of a scam. But, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume its real. (The companies return address and real phone number are listed, but that doesn't mean its legit)

Keep in mind, this is my first and only notice about this that I've ever received. I have never gotten an email or phone call regarding it. And from the sound of it, they have not gone to collections, nor does it say on the paper that they will go to collections if I don't pay up, which worries me, and I have a ton of questions to ask about it.  


1.) Seeing how this isn't a Credit Card, Medical or Loan type debt, can they even go to collections in the first place? 

2.) If they do decide to go to collections, will they take money from my bank account? I'm worried about this because that company I used to work for paid me via Direct Deposit. I'm scared that they will give my bank information to a collection company and give them the freedom to just take my money. Should I inform the bank my account has been compromised and just close / reopen a new account that they don't have the information too? 

3.) I live in California right now, but I'm moving to Washington state in April. When I move, they won't have my current address anymore. Will they still be able to find me - assuming this debt goes to collections? I've read stories about NEVER giving any information to debt collectors. So I don't want them to know where I am. 

4.) Will I get sued over this? And if so, how would they be able to sue me? Wouldn't they have to find me in person and hand me a court summons? Because if they mailed me a summons, then I'd assume that I would need to sign for it in the mail as proof that I got the summon - which I wouldn't do. I never sign for anything that I order online, and I'll be living alone in Seattle, so no one will be at my place to sign for me. They'll probably have my phone number, but I never answer the phone to numbers I don't recognize and always send them voicemail. And if I did answer to collections, I wouldn't dare tell them any personal information.  

5.) I know this is going to negatively impact my Credit Score if it goes to collections. But how many points will it deduct? I honestly do not know what my Credit Score is now... To give you an idea of my Credit Score, I've had 2 Credit Cards since about... 2014. I use one to pay my cell phone bill every month. And I use the other one to pay Netflix and Disney+. I always pay them off completely in full and on time. I have never missed a Credit Card payment or been late on them. On top of that, I purchased a brand new car in 2019. I've made every single payment on time, and in full. Come to think of it, I've never been late on any type of payment before in my life. (Rent, internet, utilities etc) I've always paid everything in full and on time - sometimes early. I've never checked my Credit Score, as I'm afraid too. Everyone says it will lower your score, so for that reason, I never check it. ANYWAYS, how many points will a roughly $3100 debt gone to collections lower my credit score? 

6.) I know that bad debts will fall off your Credit Report after 7 years. And the statue of limitations for collecting debts in California and Washington State is 4 / 6 years respectively. Meaning, after that time period is up, they can't sue or legally collect. Should I just wait it out and not pay? This will sound stupid, but... They can't sue me if they can't find me, right? lol 

After all that, what should I do? I know its a lot to take in. So take your time with your response. If I'm being honest, I have the money right now, and can pay off the debt. But as I mentioned before, I'm moving in April. I'll need the extra money to cover living expenses. Also, I do not believe that I owe them a penny, and I want to fight this. At the same time, I don't want them knowing my address, my whereabouts or even my Bank Account Info (Routing / Account Number). Its a tough situation, because fighting it would require them to know where I live, and not fighting it / slipping away to disappear will hurt my Credit Score.
