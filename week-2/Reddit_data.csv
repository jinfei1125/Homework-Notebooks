Last March, we posted a [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fhrfqo/coronavirus_megathread_resources_discussion_and/) with tons of information about Coronavirus-related issues, and in September a [second megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) was posted with additional information on updates to payroll tax deferrals, student loan interest waiver, and unemployment. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic and recent U.S. governmental actions, we are posting a third installment of this megathread. **Please keep in mind that politics and political discussions are still not allowed here.**

# Stimulus Payments (updated Jan 5, 2021)

For the second round of stimulus payments: For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $600 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $1,200 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. For head-of-household filers, it is $600 if your AGI is below $112,500. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $600 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

As with the first stimulus - If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, your payment will be reduced by 5% of the difference between your AGI and the income threshold. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $600 is completely phased out once your income hits $87,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $2,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $174,000.

The [Get My Payment portal](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) has been updated to include information regarding the second stimulus. This is the first place you should check for the status of your stimulus payment. The IRS released a [statement](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-statement-about-economic-impact-payments) about the status you are seeing on the GMP portal for second stimulus payments:

* If there is a deposit date and account information, this is where your payment will be deposited.

* If there is mailing date for a payment, allow 3-4 weeks for your check or [debit card](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-e-eip-cards) to arrive.

* If you're getting Payment Status Not Available, you will have to wait until you file your 2020 tax return to receive the Recovery Rebate Credit.

**If you are not eligible based on your 2019 tax return, or are eligible for a larger amount based on your 2020 tax return, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year to receive the owed difference of the [Recovery Rebate Credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit).** Common cases where this applies:

* I never received the first stimulus, even though I believe I was eligible, and still get an error when checking the Get My Payment portal

* I was a dependent in 2019 (and/or 2018 if your 2019 was not yet filed for the first stimulus), or mistakenly indicated that I could be claimed as a dependent, but cannot be claimed as a dependent for 2020 (Note: You don't just decide if you're a dependent or not, verify if you are eligible to be claimed as one [as defined by the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p501#en_US_2019_publink1000196863).)

* I had a child in 2020 and am now eligible for the additional amount for a qualifying dependent

### **FAQs:**

* **Q** How will I receive my stimulus payment?

* **A** 2019 tax returns returns are being used to calculate each person's stimulus payment. The bank account information provided on your 2019 tax return, whether that be for a refund deposit or debit of owed payment, will be used for direct deposit of the stimulus. 

* **Q** When will I receive my payment?

* **A** The deadline for second stimulus payments to be sent is January 15, 2021. After this date, if you have not received the stimulus payment yet, you will have to wait to claim it as the Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 tax return.

* **Q** I closed the bank account that I used for my 2019 return, or I do not recognize the account that the Get My Payment portal says it will be deposited to. How do I get my payment?

* **A** If the account is now closed or if the account information does not match an account you own, the payment will be returned to the IRS. You will then have to wait until you file your 2020 tax return to receive the Recovery Rebate Credit.

* **Q** I am eligible for the both the first and second and stimulus based on my 2018 and/or 2019 tax return, but will not be eligible based on my 2020 tax return. Will I need to pay back what I received?

* **A** No, there was no information provided in the bills requiring payments to be returned if eligibility changes between the 2018/2019 and 2020 tax years. This is also noted in the [IRS FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-j-reconciling-on-your-2020-tax-return).

* **Q** The [Get My Payment](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) portal says the payment was already sent and/or I received Notice 1444 in the mail saying my stimulus was sent, however I never actually received it. What do I do?

* **A** See the IRS page on [Payment Issued but Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Not Received](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-f-payment-issued-but-lost-stolen-destroyed-or-not-received) for guidance on starting a Payment Trace

The IRS has an extensive list of [Economic Impact Payment FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center) and a [news release](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-and-irs-begin-delivering-second-round-of-economic-impact-payments-to-millions-of-americans) regarding the second stimulus with more information

Be aware of potential scams related to stimulus payments or other coronavirus relief packages. CNBC has a helpful article with examples of [common stimulus scams](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/29/stimulus-check-scams-here-are-red-flags-to-watch-for.html).

At this time, [a $2,000 stimulus has been proposed](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602024/second-stimulus-check-update-senate-kills-2000-payments), but has not been passed by Congress. If that changes we will update this information to reflect that. 

# Payroll Tax Deferral

Payroll taxes consist of two related taxes: Social Security (6.2% of wages) and Medicare (1.45% of wages). Both employees and employers pay these taxes (i.e., for every $1 of social security taxes you pay, your employer also pays $1). Only the Social Security portion of payroll taxes may be deferred right now, not Medicare.

The Secretary of the Treasury has been [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/) to defer the collection of Social Security taxes on those making a gross income of less than $104,000 / year ($4,000 or less per bi-weekly paycheck) starting September 1.

Implementing seems to be optional by employers and many employers have decided to not implement this.

The IRS had issued Notice 2020-65 indicating that taxes deferred must be withheld and paid between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021, or interest and penalties will start accruing on May 1, 2021. **The window to payback the deferred taxes has been extended under the new stimulus bill to December 31, 2021. Deferred taxes must be paid by January 1, 2022 or interest and penalties will start accruing.** 

See the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for FAQs regarding the payroll tax deferral 

# Coronavirus-Related Distributions from Retirement Plans

Penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts for Coronavirus-Related Distributions ended December 30, 2020. If you made one of these withdrawals during 2020, remember that you have three years to pay the income taxes on the withdrawal. The IRS has an article with [Coronavirus-related relief for retirement plans and IRAs questions and answers](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/coronavirus-related-relief-for-retirement-plans-and-iras-questions-and-answers) with more info.

# Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Rollover

FSA account balances typically do not rollover year-to-year. The second stimulus package allows for FSA balances at the end of 2020 to be rolled over and used in 2021. Any FSA balance remaining at the end of 2021 may also be rolled over and used in 2022.

# Unemployment Benefits

Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) provides benefits to individuals typically not eligible for unemployment insurance, such as independent contractors or gig workers. Under the CARES Act these benefits were set to expire Dec 31, 2020. It has now been extended to March 14, 2021. Please visit your state’s PUA website for more information.

The previous unemployment relief of $300/week from the federal government and $100/week from the state expires Dec 26, 2020 (see the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for more information and FAQs regarding [this executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/) from August). **Under this new bill, federal unemployment will provide an additional $300/week through March 14, 2021, and the maximum number of weeks that unemployment can be claimed has been increased from 39 weeks to 50 weeks.**

**If you lost your job or are at risk of losing your job:**

Please read the information available in the [Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)

If you have any questions regarding those resources, feel free to ask here, but please be as specific as possible with your current situation and what steps you have taken so far.

# Student Loan Interest and Payment Waiver

The CARES Act suspended federally-held student loan payments and interest charges until September 30, 2020. The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/) signed in August extended this to December 31, 2020. The new bill has further extended this date to January 31, 2021.

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Most mortgage owners eligible for reduced or suspended payments for up to 12 months under the CARES Act 

Key points:

1. The CARES Act covers about [70% of all mortgages](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=406472) in the U.S. (those backed by Fannie and Freddie, FHA, VA, or USDA). Many companies have similar policies for most other types of loans. If you aren't sure what kind of loan you have, ask your servicer.

2. In most cases, you will [not owe the missed payments as lump sum](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/after-you-receive-relief/#repay). There was a lot of confusion about this. The new guidance says that lump sums are not required for [GSE](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Announces-Payment-Deferral-as-New-Repayment-Option-for-Homeowners-in-COVID-19-Forbearance-Plans.aspx) and [federal loans](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/SFH/documents/IACOVID19FBFactSheetConsumer.pdf).

3. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

4. Requesting mortgage relief/deferral will appear on your credit reports and may affect your eligibility for refinancing (but doesn't affect your actual credit score).

5. For more info, the CFPB published [step-by-step information](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/housing) about how to request payment relief.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs. 

Effective Dec 1, 2020, refinancing mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will incur a 0.5% [adverse mortgage fee](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/refinancing-a-mortgage-will-cost-more-thanks-to-an-adverse-market-fee.html). 

# Relief for Renters

The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/) signed in August required certain federal agencies to take steps to limit foreclosures or evictions. It did not include a list of specific actions or policies. 

Following this in September, the CDC ordered [Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions To Prevent the Further Spread of COVID-19](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/04/2020-19654/temporary-halt-in-residential-evictions-to-prevent-the-further-spread-of-covid-19) that expires December 31, 2020. **The new bill extends this order through January 31, 2021.**

Read [Protection for Renters](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/) from the CFPB and visit the [NLIHC page for COVID-19 Rental Assistance programs](https://nlihc.org/rental-assistance) for additional information and resources

Anyone have any insight into tax advantages of working from home?  Before quarantine, I had never done it but I have a friend whose job has always been home based.  He’s made comments about how he gets some type of tax benefit from working from home. Anyone able to shed light on this?

I have worked from home since 3rd week of March. I itemize my deductions.I have additional info on the 17-year old dependent question. My kid turned 17 in Sept 2020; I got my payment and it included the extra $600 for a dependent. I think the reason they say “under 17” is that kids turning 18 in 2021 still qualify.Since I have not been able to find anything online here is some information about my specific situation. I hope this will assist someone else.

I had H&R Block prepare my taxes in 2019. During this I selected that they take the tax return preparation fees out of my return. In turn the IRS sent my refund to H&R Block and then H&R Block sent my refund, minus their fee, to my checking account.

In April, I received the first EIP directly to my checking account. No issues.

I checked the ""Get my payment"" tool on the IRS's website today and saw that this second EIP payment went to a different account then the first. After some searching I went and looked at my 2019 return and saw that the account number that H&R Block gave the IRS matched the account number this second payment was sent to.

After sitting on hold for 80 minutes I was able to get ahold of someone who said that H&R Block would be processing this and sending it to my checking account, similar to my refund without any fees taken out, but could only say it might take a day or two. I will update this post when I receive the payment in my checking account.

&#x200B;

Update (1/5/2020): I received the payment in my checking account todayI just received the IRS deposit today and it was only $46.95 and I’m wondering if there was a mistake. 

My 2019 taxes I grossed $86,000 and my AGI was $73,800 after the standard deduction. 

With some back of envelope math I was expecting a $460 check. 

Anyone think this is right or a mistake? If this was a mistake who do I even contact to address this?Just making sure that I understand this correctly. I filed as a dependent for the 2019 tax season, in 2020 I turned 24 and moved out but did not receive my stimulus payments because of my 2019 tax filing status. 

This means I should be eligible for both stimulus payments when I file my 2020* taxes?

*Obviously I have lost track of the yearAnyone else get direct deposit the first time but now it's showing 'mailing' for their second?For those who did their taxes with TurboTax last year and have not got their 2nd stimulus (like myself), they just emailed me that millions of payments went into incorrect accounts and should be rectified within a few days.

Edit: I found a link on their website 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.turbotax.intuit.com/tax-news/why-havent-i-received-my-second-stimulus-check-48743/amp/So if I received the first payment based on my 2019 taxes but am not on eligible based on my 2020 taxes will I receive the 600?

On the flip side if I was ineligible and did not receive the payments based on my 2019 taxes but will be eligible based on my 2020 taxes will I be able to receive any or all of the 1800?I received my second stimulus check but still haven't gotten my first. The IRS page still says Payment #1 Status - Not Available. Is there a reason one could get the second payment and not the first? Do i just need to get my first through my 2020 tax filing?Question about dependent status. My fiancee was claimed as a dependent for 2019 tax year and as a result, did not get either stimulus payment. She supports herself, pays rent with me (we have lived together for 3 years) and she was a student until August 2020. 

Her parents were not paying more than half of her living expenses, she did not live with them. 

Can she file the recovery rebate form on 2020 tax return and get the full $1,800 plus whatever her normal tax refund might have been?",1609734845.0

Then last year, I got a line of credit to cover the balance of my HVAC loan (slightly lower rate) and cover some concrete work. Today I reduced the LOC balance to zero, and I'm feeling good! Thanks to budgeting, a small promotion, stimulus money, and no vacations due to covid, I was able to pay off about 13k in 18 months.

Next up, I'm planning on increasing my emergency fund to 10k, then dumping everything extra into my 403(b) and HSA. Any other advice?Celebrating my net worth crossing the $200k mark! Closing in on $150k of that being in retirement accounts. Feels good at 29 years old. Time to start saving for a house!Just wanted to post that thanks to Gamestop stock and COVID saving over past 6 months, I am debt free. I have a payment going to my student debt right now to finish off the last portion of money owed. From $25k student loan and $10k CC 6 months ago to $0 in debt today with extra cash still. Was saving and investing while paying down the credit cards at the same time over past few months. I have had enough to pay off CC a little bit ago but the investments were outpacing the interest of the credit cards so I let them ride a bit. Ended up cashing out today at 280% returned in past 4 months. Income is about $110,000 and would have paid things down faster but my rent is a substantial. So right now with $0 debt and $15k in a savings account I am going to start putting money back into investing in a few weeks.

It took literally 6 HOURS but I finally did it.

I haven't mailed them yet but I'm proud of myself!Probably irrationally annoyed that I'm still one 1099 short for 2020. Tax season doesn't even start until 2/12Just paid off all our student loans!

Anyone else lock down a killer refi in this crazy low-interest moment?29F, Denver. I’m spending about $10k this year to avoid a bad roommate situation- am I making a huge mistake? I live in Denver with 2 roommates and signed a 12 month lease with them. One of them has become difficult to live with, just very selfish and has a horrible boyfriend that’s over all the time. I was hiding in my room 24/7 and it took a huge mental toll, made worse by the fact that my last living parent died this year. I cannot get out of the lease unless the other 2 agree and they won’t. Since I’m working remote, I moved to where my long-distance partner lives (Oregon) and we got a place for a few months and it’s been amazing. My mood is 1000x better and I’m loving life here. I’m seriously dreading returning to Denver, but I’m wasting about $10k on the remaining year of rent when I won’t even be there. I’m justifying it because I inherited around $1.5M from my parents and I have a good salary myself so I’m investing in my own happiness right now. I also started investing in the stock market this year and I’m up about $8k which almost covers the rent! Will I regret this $10k later in life or is it just a drop in the bucket?What’s the over/under on at least some student debt being forgiven before they’re unfrozen?

3,Is this condo way out of my price range?,"I’m looking to buy my first home and am pretty overwhelmed by the process, but after *many* tours, I found a condo I’m in love with. I’m just worried about the price. The total cost is $345,000. I only have 40k for the down payment, so my monthly cost will be around ~$2,200.

**Income: $110k** ($5,200 monthly take home after all deductions/taxes). 

**Current Expenses:**

$20 streaming services 

$70 electric

$60 Internet

$70 phone bill
$400 groceries/restaurants (I know, we eat out a lot) 

$20 vehicle gas 

$10 renter’s insurance 

$75 car insurance 

$1450 rent 

**Total Current Expenses: $2,175**
Leftover gets put in general savings (majority), travel savings, and entertainment. 

It’s worth pointing out that my boyfriend and I live together and he pitches in ~$700 a month for expenses, but I’ve presented our total expenses here and only my income. I sure hope we don’t break up, but I’m the one buying the place and only want to factor my salary into whether I can afford it.  

At first glance  I feel like I would be ok, but I do worry because I’m breaking the rule about not buying a house that costs more than 3x your salary. Also, the monthly payments would be around 40% of my take home, which also sounds like a bad idea. It’s just frustrating because like many places, the housing market in my city makes it difficult to find a decent home that doesn’t break any of the common-sense rules of finance for a young professional. Thoughts?

PS: for reasons I won’t waste time on since this is already a wall of text, renting another year to save more is not going to happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5flqo/is_this_condo_way_out_of_my_price_range/,"You have a budget, your budget supports you buying this condo, with literally thousands to spare.

It's basically 3x your salary. It only exceeds by 15k. The concerns are really when you hit 4, 5, 6x salary.

You can afford this without your boyfriend's support if you need to. Just make sure you're on good financial footing with your emergency fund and also make sure the home is a good fit.

Keep in mind housing searches are not ""I see a home, I want it, I buy it."" It's more along the lines of ""I see a home, 6 people want it, only one of us will get it."" You may be looking for a little while for a good fit that you also have the winning offer on.Does your monthly cost include the condo association fee or management fee?  If not what is that a month?AJT - I'd be happy to provide you some direction here.  I have been in the mortgage biz for 20 years and own and operate my own mortgage brokerage.

In reviewing your info above, I have run some preliminary figures for you below and I will also provide you with some additional info.

First off, while scary if you think it through, lenders will typically allow you to have a debt to income ratio of no higher than 50% of your GROSS income.  This equals: (monthly minimums on credit cards & installment debts + monthly car payment(s) + monthly student loan payments + mortgage payment(s) + monthly taxes and insurance + monthly association dues (if applicable)) / total gross earnings (yeah...before taxes!).  

From an underwriting standpoint, you will definitely qualify from an income standpoint, based on the info in your original post.  You just need to be comfortable with the payment, i.e. YOU need to qualify yourself.  Based on the fact that you have $40K for down payment + closing costs and the purchase price is $345K, you will more than likely take 90% financing for $310,500.  Assume a 30 year fixed rate of 3.000% (this is high in this market, but be conservative).  Your principal and interest payment will be $1,309.08.  You will need to add 1/12th of the total annual taxes + 1/12th the HO6 policy (walls in insurance for the condo - the HOA dues will cover all exterior insurance under a master policy) + PMI (private mortgage insurance) which should be about $100 a month. I'd hypothesize that your condo payment all in will be between $1800 and $2000 a month.  If you add in the expenses listed above of $715, your total output a month will land at about $2700.  If you subtract off this figure from your take home earnings, you will have net cash flow of $2500.  Clearly, there are other expenses you will incur throughout the month, e.g. clothes, entertainment, etc...but this is a pretty good view of what to expect, i.e. $2500 net cash flow after housing + bills. 

In summation, you are actually sitting in a really good position.  I say this, because while lenders allow you to qualify based on 50% of your GROSS earnings, you actually qualify based on \~50% of your NET earnings, which is atypical for a first time home buyer.  I'd feel very comfortable advising you to move forward with the purchase, but in the end, it is you who needs to decide if you are comfortable!

Happy to have some additional discussions if you'd like.To save yourself from complications or questions with you boyfriend later, please do a rental agreement.  Make it generous...10 days notice of move out.  No deposit.  Let him know once you combine finances you will be happy to put him on the mortgage.  The problem is currently you aren't married and don't have any financial protections.  If he is living with you and contributing in many states the argument can be made that half the property is his. A rental agreement can protect you both.  You won't loose your investment and he won't be on the hook for a potential foreclosure.My biggest piece of advice is no matter how comfortable you get with your boyfriend, do not add him to mortgage or title. If he’s willing to chip in, great. But there’s no need for his name to be on the house. 

Source: me. I made this mistake and it turned into a living hell for 3 years and idk if I’ll ever emotionally or mentally recover from this grave regret :)I bought a condo in this price range with about the same salary and  down payment  And it’s been extremely reasonable. I rent out a room in it for $1k, but even without the roommate i find it easy to pay and don’t worry about living alone if I decide to. And that’s with a much higher vacation/restaurant budget :)The 3x your salary rule was when interest rates were 8%. 

If you are saving almost $2000/month, you should be fine. Keep in mind your income tax may go down a bit with the mortgage interest and state tax deductions. 

That said, you will want an emergency fund and a moving/new stuff fund as you will probably need a bunch of weird stuff that you don't know you need now. At least it's less than a house.I don't get the problem.  You can def afford this.My biggest problem with condos is that there's also usually an HOA. With a home, The only things that would raise in price are your taxes and insurance. With a condo, your HOA is largely outside your control other than you getting a vote. 

If you're already at your comfort level budget wise, I would take a hard look at that HOA fee if there is one and thing about what would happen if that were to be raised significantly.

This is often the reason why people move to the suburbs. The farther away you are from the central hub, the more affordable housing gets. You sacrifice your commute time for more affordable housing.When I bought my home just over a year ago, it was almost 4x my income. In the last few months, after several promotions and adding a part time job that I love (and will eventually lead into a higher paying ft job), my house is only about 2.5x my income. I’m not advocating for buying more house than you can afford, but if the numbers say you’ll be ok, don’t walk away because of some general rule you’ve heard.",1611673002.0
4,20 y.o. and accidentally contributed too much to my Roth IRA,"Hey everyone,

I am a 20 y.o. college student and made the decision to open up a Roth IRA this year, and set up weekly contributions to make sure I stuck with my goal. When I opened it, I didn't know much about retirement accounts, but did know that $6,000 is the max yearly contribution; I didn't realize, however, that if I made less than that, I could only contribute up to my earned income for the year. I just learned that this week, and believe I contributed up to $500 in excess of my earned income limitation. I know that the IRS will tax the excess at 6% if I leave it in, and I could withdraw it before tax day, but also don't want to pay the early withdrawal fee. I was wondering if anyone in this sub has been in a similar spot before and/or knows what my best option is for saving money. Any help is much appreciated.

You may have to pay tax is there was an appreciation realized on the excess contribution, but they'll take care of the forms you need for that.

5,Showing teenage children how our family budgets,"My wife and I have two teenage children, and I teach them often on how to handle money now and when they are eventually out on their own. For whatever reason, my wife and I have never shared with them how much money we make or how much we have in retirement savings, but I’m now thinking that they are old enough for all four of us to sit down as a family and “show them the books.”  Let them see how our budget works, let them see what we make and how much stuff REALLY costs, how we handle savings, etc. Perhaps even let them help us go through the budgeting steps and maintain the budget together over time. Have any of you done something similar? Any reason why we as parents should not divulge our actual numbers?

Edit: woke up this morning to so many great comments, and I thank each of you!  And for additional context, our kids’ ages are 14 and (nearly) 16. The older one is very interested in making wise financial decisions, the younger one is more young-at-heart still.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l55pah/showing_teenage_children_how_our_family_budgets/,"Sharing is great! It might just be a lot to go through everything in this big sit down moment. I'm not sure how much a teen will care about your 401k numbers. My parents were always  open about finances but we never had some event where they revealed them. It was just part of life, not some special one time secretive thing that was revealed to us - we talked about salary when they got a raise and budgeting/emergency funds when they lost a job, we talked about taxes and about savings for retirement/social security when I got my first job, about what they'd saved for me & student loans when I was in high school thinking about applying. We moved and I learned some about mortgages, credit scores, etc. They put me on a credit card for emergencies and we talked about debt, paying it off every month, credit scores. 

It's all about communication. You want them to feel like they can ask anytime. The first year I was on my own, I bugged my parents a bunch - how's my budget, what retirement account should I get, what credit card, etc, etc.Just throwing my hat in the ring — if you and your wife are making ends meet but you think your kids might experience some kind of disconnect between “hey mom and dad are doing so well!” and seeing yalls finances that they go to “oh my god that’s all they have? For retirement? How fast does money grow? Will they be okay?” I would say just be ready to maybe stomp out some fears early on and walk them through how you know you’ll be okay (or what you’re doing to prepare if that’s not the case!) 

Maybe bring the topic up again a week or two later to see if they have any questions that have popped up that they want to talk about, and if not move on with you lives :) 

Great job being proactive for your kids!I wish my parents had done this for me. I’ll do this for my kids 100%.Off topic, but as soon as our kids got a drivers license we opened a credit card for them with a $500 limit. This did two things, if they were low on gas or I needed milk or they had a breakdown they would have money, and it also began a credit history for them. 

But to answer your question, I don't see anything wrong with sharing numbers, but maybe let them know what income they might expect to earn and don't use yours as a standard. I think kids assume they'll start earning $80k right out of college, and depending on their major they may very well earn significantly less.I think it's great you are showing them and wish my parents had done the same.

My mom is super secretive (the ""you don't talk finances"" type of family) and my dad lets my mom handle the finances.

We've talked now that I'm an adult about finances, but it's not specific.  My mom is the type to think everything is ""common sense"" like we were supposed to learn by osmosis or something without being given the details. 

Because they are teens -- I definitely think you should speak to them about your personal finances staying within the family (not blabbing to their friends or whatever).  But the process in how you and your wife budget for the month, expenses, how your emergency fund is set up, how you set aside savings and investments are all valuable information to learn.  Especially from parents who are in a place that they can teach and lead by example.This is sort of related:  When I was a kid in the 80s and 90s, my parents decided to stop paying for everything.  No movies.  No money for dining with friends.  Etc.

Glasses.  Clothes.  Dr copays for sports physicals.  Music lessons.  My parents stopped paying for everything.

Instead, they calculated how much they had been spending on us over the years.  (All the meals.  All the quarters at arcades.  Money to go out or whatever.) Then they rounded way down and just gave us that money.

Overnight my allowance went from $2 per week to $50 per week.

My siblings and I were then in charge of everything.  We had had life insurance policies prior, and they gave us the bills.  (""What is this $10 life insurance policy bill for? Why do I need it?  I'm cancelling it."")

My parents saved a ton doing this.  And we learned a ton.

By the time I was in college, I was saving like a master.  I was investing.  My IRA account that I researched and started in college hit $100k by the end of college. And I was far from rich... Just saved $10 here and $10 there.  Add my parents were far from wealthy. They, in fact, needed to borrow money from me while I was still in college to pay bills.

I have stories.Just let your kids know that this information stays in the family. Growing up, my parents weren’t making much money, but they handled all the bills and all the finances because well, they’re parents. Using their hard work as a mold I was able to purchase my own house at 24, without borrowing a dime from them. However I only ever knew about credit card payments. I wish my parents would have sat me down before and just explained “x for cable, y for insurance, z for the phone bill, etc. “ purely so that I had a reasonable estimation of how much it could possibly cost. I feel like it would better prepare them to understand how much savings they can expect to have every month and save some shell shock when they get out on their own.If you’re going to show them the family budget, always explain the “why”. So many people go through life thinking “my parents did this so I should also do this” without actually understanding the reasoning. Why you’re budgeting x towards y? Why your 401k/retirement accounts are allocated in such a way? Why you may have specific insurance policies, etc.  

And instead of hard numbers, maybe percentages so they can start applying it to themselves (i.e. I need to save 15% from my part time job vs I need to save x $ from my part time job). It’s also a good workaround if your partner is not comfortable sharing how much the family brings home income.My parents taught me nothing about money. I’m not a brat but was definitely spoiled. Made my 20s financially tough. I now value transparency.I think a key to a successful conversation here is to not get too far ahead of them. Take it at whatever pace keeps their interest and let their questions lead the discussion. 

They have information pushed on them all the time and they will be good at just nodding their heads and letting it go in one ear and out the other. 

As others have suggested, using ballpark numbers to walk them through how you set aside enough each paycheck to cover monthly and annual expenses is a great exercise.",1611633689.0
6,Bank account closed due to negative balance,"A few months ago my bank account fell into the negatives. Today my bank closed the account while it was still negative.

All participating banks can see it and can refuse to open bank accounts for you.

Could also send you to collections. Collections report on your credit.> But i’m just curious, what could potentially happen if I didn’t pay the money back to the bank?

If this closure is reported to Chexsystems and/or Early Warning Services, it will be significantly harder for you to open bank accounts for the next 5 years.

Additionally, the bank could report the debt to the credit bureaus and/or send debt collectors after you. Worst case is that the bank or a debt collector sues youThey will report you negatively to the three credit repositories and you will find it very difficult to impossible to open another bank account anywhere. It will also impact your credit scores negatively. 

Pay them back ASAP.Open a new account ASAP, like right now. Maybe it's not yet reporting to Chexsystems...I had this happen to me in my younger years. I paid off balance and still was on that list. Could not open a bank account. I had to pay it again. I was pissed but you need to have a bank account sometime for convenience.

Just pay it and get the receipt.They will also report you to Chexsystems, which is like a credit bureau but for people who have outstanding account balances for checking accounts. If you attempt to open a checking account with another bank, they'll decline your application until you settle your balance.It will absolutely go to collectionsAs others are saying, this will make it very difficult to open a new account at any banking institution and will negatively affect any potential credit you have. Speaking with your bank and paying off the negative balance is your only solution. Opening another account somewhere else is not recommended. Pay that off first and then open a new account somewhere else. If you try to open an account at the same institution you most likely will have to make a very restricted account that cannot be upgraded to a normal account for an extended period of time. I used to work at a credit union and I have seen this situation many times. If you really work with your bank and part of the negative balance is fee's, you may be able to have some of them reversed to make paying it off easier. Just be honest and open with your situation.Pay it off I worked for a well know credit union and Chexsystems was used in order to verify if new applicants were trustworthy. Chexsystems is like the credit bureaus, it reports any delinquent bank account a person has had within 5 years. You can even request a Chexsystems report directly from them online or in writing to see if any delinquent bank accounts show up. 

Your best bet is to pay it off if you can or speak with the delinquency/collections department at the bank. At my old job we had members who set up payments plans to alleviate their account from going to collections and after they paid it off they were able to apply for a new checking account. 

Consequences if not paid off sucks. You’ll have a difficult time getting an account with main stream banks/CRedit unions. And, worse it’ll get sent to Collections and stay on your credit for 7 dreadful years.Banks are allowed to waive fees. I had a fee once, called about it, they took it off by simply asking them to.  Certainly worth asking if they will waive/forgive some or all of your fees.",1611681719.0
7,Mom diagnosed with terminal brain cancer with poor prognosis. Case workers are claiming that she needs to do 2 weeks of inpatient rehab for the insurance to cover her treatment.,"Just after Christmas, my mom was unexpectedly diagnosed with grade IV glioblastoma. We immediately met with a neurosurgeon who recommended a craniotomy to remove a golf-ball sized tumor that was pressing on her motor and prefrontal cortex, which he performed shortly after. Prior to the surgery, she had the same issues with her fine motor skills on that side, and she saw a major improvement after 2 weeks of an anti inflammatory steroid. The neurosurgeon himself said we could expect her coordination and motor skills to improve as the swelling goes down. The case worker however keeps saying that the internal medicine doctor strongly recommends inpatient rehab and to go home instead would be leaving AMA. Her prognosis is short—about 9 months—so during what could be our last good 2 weeks together before she begins treatment and potentially gets sicker, she’ll be in a care facility that doesn’t allow visitors.

Overall, my question is if there’s any way to speak to her insurance provider so that her treatment thus far (and oncology) will be covered if she declines the inpatient rehab, or if we have any further recourse. We are located in TX.

Thanks in advance.

Some clarification: the case worker is pushing for the inpatient PT because she has very little spatial awareness/fine motor skills on her left hand/arm. She is able to walk and do everything else, but she does have trouble doing a few essential tasks given her limited mobility. I am a college student that recently moved back in at home to take care of and spend time with her, and with a little bit of help from me she’s very much able to do her everyday routine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l51n2x/mom_diagnosed_with_terminal_brain_cancer_with/,"Welcome to /r/personalfinance!

That is not AMA. I would encourage you to call your insurance company, the number should be on the insurance card. I will warn you, they will likely be useless. The recommendation may be rehab, but if your Mom is medically stable, where she is discharged to is her choice, and no one else's. I am an internal medicine doctor at a hospital.My condolences. My mother passed away from the same illness 2 weeks ago. My mother went to rehab before she passed and we were unable to see her during her last days. Sorry , I know this isn’t an answer  but I can just relate.For what it’s worth I’m a PT and I work in acute care and inpatient rehab - there is no reason they should be forcing this issue given the circumstances. The only times I’ve ever heard people pull out the AMA argument and that insurance won’t cover it is if they are trying to bluff to convince the family to go along with the recommendation. This is a horrible tactic and it’s often just not true and I would always tell my patient that the choice is always theirs at the end of the day. We can’t force treatment on people. Insurance is usually doing everything they can to deny rehab not try to force themselves to pay for it, so you can be quite sure this argument is bull shit. 

All that being said, I’d highly recommend you consider if a short rehab stay is right for your mom. Two weeks of therapy could make the difference between her being somewhat independent at home in the near term and needing more care from family. Especially with neurological injuries the return can be very substantial. Good luck, and whatever you choose should be fine from your insurance.Clinical case management nurse here.

If your parents still have the annual book the insurance mailed out this will be your best friend.

Being discharged from the acute care hospital and NOT going to a rehab is NOT leaving against medical advice. If the hospitalist or the surgeon said, hey you should go to rehab you could have a very real conversation about in home rehab. The insurance cannot dictate her going to rehab.

I've some concerns about this. Why is the case worker saying this? Clearly something is up. They are attempting to bully you into placing a compromised person into a location where the death rate is off the charts across the country! I would love to hear their rationale!

Stand firm. There is no reason for her to go to rehab if the family is stepping up to ensure safety and care! In fact. She's less then a year. Depending upon your state in home hospice resources should be available. In assuming the recent surgery was a comfort measure? Or exploratory that then resulted in comfort measures? No plans for chemo/radiation? Talk to the doctor. Google your state.

What you can do for safety. Remove throw rugs, cords odd sticky outy things. Walk the house. Can it be tripped over? Shower bench. Shower head hand held. Suction shower bars do not work well. Install screwed in ones. A transport chair is more narrow than an actual wheelchair (four small wheels as opposed to two huge wheels in back). Comfortable pull on clothing.

Check that book from her insurance. They should list if they cover dme (durable medical equipment) dme is the hospital bed, wheelchair, shower bench, walker, adaptive equipment (like a grabber, dressing aids, showering aids ie sponge on a stick) oxygen. They might cover having a nurse visit for medication management, wound care or a CNA to assist with showering.

Good luck.First and foremost I am so sorry your family is in this position.  My mom passed away 2 years ago from cancer she was also hospitalized for so unfortunately I have been in your shoes.  

She has to say she wants to switch to comfort care once her end is near and they will update her medical records to stop treating her illness and instead focus on keeping her comfy at end of life.  They will typically allow a patient to go home when they get to that point if they have family help and want to.  They make it part of the pallative care plan.  Insurance will cover because you’re not going against any doctor recommendations at that point as you are no longer seeking treatment.  

Where it gets tricky is if she is still wanting treatment to try and postpone her life as long as possible.  If she is asking for treatment she has to follow the doctors medical advice for her placement or insurance can say she’s going against medical advice if she checks herself out and decline to cover any of her stay.I'm a nurse that works for an insurance company. I am not based out of Texas so I can't speak for any Texas specific rules. My job is to review for medical necessity of inpatient hospital admissions and continued stay at a hospital among other things. While I do not work with claims or billing directly and cannot guarantee any payments if I approve a hospital stay, I can tell you that a patient leaving AMA has nothing to do with me approving a hospital stay. You meet criteria or you do not meet criteria based on the reason for inpatient admission and reason for continued hospital stay.

A patient refusing to admit to inpatient rehab isn't leaving AMA, leaving AMA would be like a patient comes in with chest pain, leaves the hospital after 2 days even though doctors recommended a longer hospital stay for continued monitoring, workup, and treatment for a possible heart attack.

Inpatient rehab is prettt expensive - if the patient can go home with family and home health, the insurance company probably would prefer this anyway.Medical bills aren't denied because you leave against medical advice.  That is an old misguided attempt by medical providers to keep you there and go along with treatment plans you disagree with.

Talk with her primary care or specialist doctor and see what they think.  The difference between at home therapy services and inpatient rehab (skilled nursing facility) is very different though.
Going home will mean 99.9% of her needs will.be on the family to take care of unless you plan to pay for it cash.  Outside of that, if PT or some infrequent skilled nursing is needed at home, that is able to be ordered by any doctor (so her primary or specialist she sees can write the orders if the hospital refuses too because of the AMA issue).I am an internal medicine physician and could perhaps provide some background info to hospital movements. When I am trying to figure out where a patient is going to be discharged to there are tons of factors to consider. One main difference between inpatient rehab vs a skilled nursing facility vs home care is intensity/frequency of rehab, and I am looking at this strictly from a PT/OT perspective. Inpatient rehab generally requires patients ""well"" enough to engage with 3+ hours of rehab per day, like an hour of PT, an hour of OT etc.. It adds up to dozens more hours of therapy. Skilled Nursing may get an hour per day, maybe not. Home PT/OT generally a few (maybe 3) visits per week for an hour. So, the level of therapy gained in that time period is a huge difference.

With that said, depending on prognosis and how quick of a decline is expected, and grade IV glio is almost as bad as they come I am sorry, the therapy may be a waste of time away from family and not provide much, if any noticeable benefit for any meaningful amount of time. It obviously depends on your moms specific case but don't just go by what the case manager wants, ask the neurologist or primary doctor to have a discussion with you and ask them if they think, in her case, it will actually be beneficial or a waste of time.

I am VERY sorry for her and your situation, it sucks terribly. If you have further questions feel free to ask.You have a lot going on.  If you’re not at MD Anderson please get a second opinion before the surgery. The first surgery is so important (source: husband at 2.5 years with GBM, shitty first surgery).

I would also ask your insurance company to assign you a case manager. They won’t have all the answers but should at least be able to point you to the right place.

Why wouldn’t they determine her rehab status after the surgery? I’m in CA but this whole thing seems weird to me. You shouldn’t need to stay for 2 weeks to access chemo pills and radiation and unless your mom is in rough shape, no reason why she couldn’t do home therapy for much of it.",1611620446.0
8,The IRS SSA have an incorrect birthday on file for myself and it makes doing taxes so much of a hassle.,I found this out a couple years ago and have gotten around it by filling by mail as turbo tax won't let me e file unless I use the incorrect birthday which I never have.

My question is if it's illegal or fraud to use the incorrect birthday to be able to e-file and quickly get my taxes.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5ghuh/the_irs_ssa_have_an_incorrect_birthday_on_file/,"IRS and SSA are two different agencies. 

IRS doesn't own your DoB, so contact SSA to have them update their records. This will (eventually) correct the IRS records and allow you to e-file. 

https://www.ssa.gov/agency/contact/The answer is to get the dob corrected through the social security administration.Do this through SSA. They have the system or record for this data. It actually shouldn't be too bad as long as you have a certified birth certificate. I have my doubts that the IRS would be pick up on this change in time to make this year's filings going smoother, but hopefully for next year and going forward.I had this happen: take a copy of your birth certificate to the SSA office. Not too hard. 

The hard part was figuring what was wrong when suddenly my e-file was rejected!You should file your taxes with the correct information. 

You should also contact the SSA and have your birthdate corrected. Good luck with that though. Maybe get your congressperson to help navigate the bureaucracy.I’ve been filing my taxes by mail since 2017 because of the same issue. The craziest part is that I was able to successfully file taxes using the IRS’s E-file system from 2013-2016 with no issue, I don’t understand it at all.

I called the IRS about it, who referred me to SSA, who told me I had to show up in person since I couldn’t verify my identity over the phone without knowing the incorrect DOB they had on file. I went to the SSA with my ID, SS card and birth certificate and waited for two hours. The woman at SSA told me that they have two databases with everyone’s SS information, and because my DOB was incorrect in both of them, that I had to go to my municipality of birth to get this corrected. I had recently moved from the east coast to the Midwest just before all of this, so that never happened. Once I realized mailing works, I just stuck with that. 

The SSA lady did at least tell me what incorrect DOB they had on file, and I did have to enter this DOB on the stimulus website to get my $1200 direct deposited. Glad I knew!For the last seven years, I've had the same issue whenever I tried to efile by myself. Before that I used my mother's tax guy and never had an issue. When I moved and started trying to do my own taxes, I learned the IRS has the wrong birthdate on file. Though TurboTax never actual though me that, just that there was an error.  CreditKarma's tax service is the one that told me last year that the issue was my birthdate. But oddly enough if I go in somewhere and do my taxes, they can efile for me with no issues.[deleted]The same thing happened to me, except I e-filed with my correct DOB for years and suddenly last year, it said it was wrong. How did you find out what the incorrect birthday they had for you was?No, don't put any information you know is inaccurate on your tax return.

Contact the agency that handles birth certificates for the state you were born in, and you can request a new one. Then go back to the SSA and get it updated.

You still have plenty of time to file, so you might be able to do everything required to get it corrected before the deadline (which could possibly be extended again given the pandemic). Otherwise just do a paper return again this year.",1611675648.0
9,Binge eating disorder is affecting my finances in a terrible way,"Last month I spent $600 on uber eats.

The month before, it was $460

Most days I will spend between $5-$15 on impulse binge food (cakes, cookies, things like this)

I have just started to work with a psychologist about this. I see them twice a month and it costs $445. We’re making progress, but it’s slow.

I am trying to fix this, but there is no denying that it is a slow process that will take time. I suspect it will be 18 months or so before I am “better”. 

I have already got the cheapest phone, electric, internet and rent that I could find (I live in a family owned property and pay below market rent). 

I’m embarrassed, truth be told. I feel like an addict and I want to get better. 

I would really like to hear from people who have BED or who have recovered from it on how they went about fixing their finances.

How did you encourage yourself to save money?

How did you learn to spend less on food?

How did you come to enjoy cooking at home more?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5sbu5/binge_eating_disorder_is_affecting_my_finances_in/,"A big step that helped me was acknowledging that I will eat pleasurable foods whether or not I buy them from the grocery store.  So keeping things at home like frozen pizza, ice cream, frozen french fries, chips and dip, etcetera along with healthy options if I do feel like cooking really helps.  Another thing that helped is planning meals that actually feel like a treat, like steak or scallops. If eating at home feels like a chore and ordering out feels wonderful, you'll never change -- why would anyone!I found something I love more than food to spend my money on. For me it was my car now I’m more concerned with saving up for cooler shit to put on it than a steak hoagie with American cheese and grilled onions from Wawa lolInstead of ordering ice cream for delivery, buy ice cream at the grocery store. Etc.
Being a binge eater doesn’t need to leave you broke. 
I get it. I binge eat.Can you, you know, go out and buy the food instead of calling Uber? Force yourself to get up, get dressed, and go to the store or restaurant.If this is hurting your health more than your finances, cut up all your credit cards, delete them from all the delivery apps, cancel the accounts if necessary. It is better to be alive and have a poor credit score than be in a coffin with a perfect 850.

I know that is an extreme suggestion, but go as far down that option as you deem necessary. I would recommend at the least that you delete the apps. 

For myself, I limit myself to one food delivery a week. Because of all the charges and fees, I'll order about 4 meals worth so those fees are spread over a few meals. My goal is to spend no more than $12 per meal. I can't count how many times I had a bunch of food I was in the mood for in the ""cart"" but it was coming out to $15 per meal or more, so I just closed the app and found something at home to eat. There's always tomorrow to find a better priced meal.I still struggle with perceived stressful situations, but switching to the carnivore way of eating and extended water fasting helps on all counts.Delete the app, cancel your account. Sure you can recreate it each time but add as many steps as you can to the processNot a binge-eater, but I can relate to stress eating. Now when I want more sugar than I know I should have, I chew gum. If I feel stressed from work or other situation, I drink tea. This includes those monthly times when us people with uteruses must have ALL the sugar and fat...

If you don't like cooking, first try to ""meal prep"" small fruit medley bowls, with grapes, strawberries, blackberries, etc. Maybe pair with a banana. Maybe try using these as snacks instead of ordering out. No cooking involved, just rinsing the produce off. As you probably already know, impulse ordering out comes from not having a plan when that time comes. Filling up on fruit (especially the fibrous skins on a lot of fruits) is cheaper by volume than filling up on empty sugars and fats.

I also remember to stay hydrated--if I had my main meal and I'm ""hungry"" for more than a little snack before my next, I'm usually just thirsty.

Gum, tea, and water are cheap! And can contribute to making the food you do have stretch, which results in less trips to the grocery store (less spent $$$)Cooking your own food is the way to go.   It is cheaper, healthier, fresher, tastier.  The only downside is that it takes work and planning. 

If you wait until you're hungry to start thinking about what your going to have for dinner, you've already lost.   At that point having to pick a recipe, drive to the grocery store,  buy the ingredients, come home and actually cook it...will seem so daunting that you'll just give up and order something from doordash.

Instead plan your meals days ahead of time.  Look up and choose recipes online when your not hungry.  Make a double meal and put half of it in the fridge for the next day (so you don't have to cook every single night).  Plan your whole week in advance (include some snacks) and buy it all at the grocery store.  Prepare what you can in advance over the weekend (chopping things, mixing sauces), so there isn't so much to do on weeknights when you get home from work.   Planning and preparation is key to not ordering out every night.",1611708642.0
10,Sprint will not cancel account,"I’m sorry is this doesn’t apply or is not the right place, I am just exasperated.

In August my wife and I called Sprint to cancel our account. We have the chat logs where we clearly indicate our desire and intent to cancel. We were told we can only cancel by calling their number, which we abide by and proceed to do.

During this phone call, there was a verbal dispute with the representative as she was adamant they could not prorate the cancellation, and even though I was cancelling in August we would be charged for the entire billing cycle, with our final bill coming Sept 21st.

We received our final bill, and waited until Oct to pay it off. 

After we paid it off, unbeknownst to us, they reactivated one of the lines and continued to charge us, this was done without any authorization or consent, after we explicitly stated our desire to cancel and even after an argument about why the cancellation date couldn’t be sooner than September.

Since the account was considered closed, we did not know about the charges or the reactivation until we received a letter from Sprint saying that our account was passed due and headed to collections.

Since we received this letter, we have called 5 additional times, each time we call we “cancel”, or at least are given the run around and taken through the entire cancellation process. We are told that the cancellation is guaranteed, and that we need to discuss with collections to take care of the outstanding debt (they can’t do anything since they sent it off).

Well today, I just received another letter, notifying us on more charges, and the dates of service show Dec 22- Jan 22.

How can we call 5/6 times to cancel service, and then they refuse to cancel and continue to charge us month after month?

What options of recourse do we have to put this issue to bed and remove this from our credit report?

Sprint has been zero help during this entire process, and it feels like we are being fraudulently charged for accounts that we did not authorize?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5kci6/sprint_will_not_cancel_account/,"Write their customer relations team and express your concerns.  Outline dates you called in and what happened each call, plus point out there has been no usage.  They will resolve.  

Sprint Customer Relations, 
6391 Sprint Parkway, 
Overland Park KS 66251-4300Sprint is pure evil.  Had the same thing, except I called the month, paid in full.  Multiple times they told me ""I see in the notes you cancelled, it was accepted but never put through"" or ""I listened to the previous call, not sure why they didn't put it through""

Only thing you can do is keep calling and escalate, don't pay anything past for the billing cycle in which you cancelled.  Also if you have records of any cancellation (Email, or even chat) Keep them.

Not sure how Sprint is even in business.  I had Sprint tell me that they even seen that I cancelled and I'm good to go since (three months prior) and still kept getting bills.  I just kept staying adamant and had the exact time and dates of cancellation.  Took about six calls, three being quite long.  Then they tried to charge me like $1.00 in tax/fees after removing my bill because that was the small bit of tax/fees they didn't remove.  That one was promptly removed in 5 minutes after I absolutely snapped on them.

Don't bother going in store, they can't do anything but call just like you did.  

Your only avenue is keep documentation, snip screenshots of what your accounts say, take a picture or email of when it shows they randomly reactivated.  I would call and flip out about the threat of collections.

The biggest thing is did you actually pay of the billing cycle of when you cancelled.  For example if you cancelled mid billing cycle, you still have to pay that billing cycle.  Anything after that, don't pay.  As others said, send in a letter but keep calling/checking the account.

EDIT: If able always cancel through email (despite what ANY COMPANY, says you are to be cancelled that exact day... even if they take two weeks to get back to you) or chat.  I made it a habit of saving or screenshotting every single chat.  Cause once you have picture proof you're at least covered for everything.It says there are 2 comments but I cannot see any.

Edit: Not sure why the downvotes? I can see some now but this was at the very start?Are you under contract?Can you contact the BBB or if it applies, the FTC? What they are doing should be considered illegal and they need someone to put them in their place.Check out r/legaladvice.Type up a concise letter outlining the facts. Attach any supporting evidence. Send it to Sprint and make sure you list CC to the BBB and your Attorney General. Mail copies of everything to the BBB and the Attorney General.

Also, dispute the collections report on your credit score. Follow that up constantly. Big companies like Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, etc. will routinely ignore customer complaints and reports to the Better Business Bureau because they can. Unfortunately, you may have to put a lot of effort into following through with this. Hopefully, you have a proactive Attorney General's office in your area. Even though Sprint is a large corporation, they don't want to piss of Attorney General's. When they get enough complaints, they can make even large corporations like Sprint back peddle quickly. It's not uncommon for cell providers to use dirty tricks to keep consumers from switching to a different provider when their contract expires.I had a very similar run around with TMobile a couple months ago. Kept calling to cancel, was told they really did cancel my account this time, turns out they kept a line active and we're still charging me, rinse and repeat. 

Don't pay anything! I ended up filing a complaint with the BBB and eventually got all my money back. Keep any records you have and just keep pushing, that's my best advice. 

Good luck!!Always put shit like this in writing, always always always! 
Don't talk to anyone on the phone unless you are recording it (check your state laws on 1 party vs 2 party consent for recording). They will pull this shit every single chance they get.

And this bullshit about having to call some number to cancel? Nope. Doesn't work like that. You can not be compelled to continue to do business with a company if you choose not to. If you're not under contract and you cancel, that's it, they cannot continue to charge you and if they do you can sue them. 

Paper trail (email works too), always a paper trail. And if they refuse to see reason you submit all your paperwork and correspondence to your state AG's office and I promise you they'll sort them the fuck out in short order. They take these predatory business practices seriously but most people don't report them so they get away with it[removed]",1611686264.0
11,How to politely decline a family-friend selling life insurance?,"I reached out to a long-time family friend for financial guidance, knowing that their business is really on selling life insurance. Their plans has certainly benefitted my parents but my parents says they no longer have the plan since we are all older and independent, so they are trustworthy. We did the typical song-and-dance and got some good financial advice during first few meetings, and we just finished their proposals of whole / term / index life insurance. We said its interesting and would think about it.

The proposal is to rollover a partial amount of my older employers 401ks (blend of pre-tax and Roth) to one of those plans (they recommended term). I am intrigued about the flexibility of pulling some money from it, now that we are soon to be homeowners and would great to pull with minimal penalties and taxes in case of emergencies . However, I think the Trad & Roth IRA would certainly have a better RoR and would like to move forward with that.

So the two things I'd like to get feedback on:

1. Is the plan to proceed with the rollover of former employee 401ks to IRAs better? Even without the term life insurance flexibility to withdraw?
2. What's the best way to politely decline these proposals, while still getting key financial advice from them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5kamw/how_to_politely_decline_a_familyfriend_selling/,"""No""

They are a salesman, not financial advisor. Don't take their advice.This is a better place for financial advice than anywhere that sells products1. Your question is confusing - term life insurance doesn't have a withdrawal option, it doesn't have a cash value while you're alive. If you need life insurance, term is the way to go. Life insurance isn't a good investment tool for the vast majority of people (there are tax situations where it makes sense for wealthy individuals).  
  
2. When they ask if you'd like to buy the product, say ""No, thank you"" and end the conversation. If you aren't paying this person for their advice, you shouldn't expect them to keep giving it for free. The polite thing to do is not string a salesperson along hoping to get some benefit out of wasting their time. If this person only makes money when they sell you products, continuing to occupy that time when you have no intention of buying their product is rude in the context of a well-intentioned, trusted family friend.Totally agree with all the advice. I might add the following best practice:  It can be a bit of a tease to reach out to someone in professional sales asking for advice on their product without intent to buy. Maybe couch the conversation at the start with “I’m not looking to buy, I just want to understand” 

Maybe unnecessary but it’s not like they called you out of the blue selling an MLM.> I reached out to a long-time family friend for financial guidance, knowing that their business is really on selling life insurance. 

The only advice they are going to give you is to buy their life insurance. I'm not sure what other advice you think this person is going to give you. Since you called them, I would say ""no thanks"" very politely.Life insurance is not a good investment.  Investments aren't good life insurance.  Get some term from a reputable company that will be there.No thank you.  As for plugging them for financial advice?  No.  That's their job, don't take advantage.I smell primerica. They have a few interesting products, but they are way overpriced for what they are to feed commissions and upline huns.

If you need financial advice, talk to a fee only fiduciary.Ever hear a wealthy person tell another wealthy person they made their money from investing in life insurance?  Nope.  Do not sign up for whole life.  The person selling it take 70-95% of your first years payments.Index Universal Life is only better option in limited circumstances. If you're really interested, I could explain when they might be a good idea but chances are you'd be wasting time and money.

Generally speaking, roll old 401Ks into IRAs. If you need life insurance, get term.

As for how to politely decline, just explain that you don't think it's the best option for you right now",1611686130.0
12,"Laid off on Jan 31, but a prospective employer is asking for salary history. Advice? Can I negotiate now?","Hello PF!

For a short description of my situation I am working for an IT staffing company in the North Carolina area.  Our contract was underbid and as a result our team is being reduced and I will be let go effective Jan 31.  I have been applying for jobs and have had a recent company show interest.  I am currently on the now 4th interview which will be in person.  Along with setting a time for this meeting, providing a list of references, and filling out a background check form I am also being asked to provide a salary history.

In all honesty I have never been asked to provide one of these before so I am unsure what to list.  I am also afraid that this may destroy any negotiation room I have.

Does PF have any advice on how to approach a salary history with a potential new employer?

thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5domw/laid_off_on_jan_31_but_a_prospective_employer_is/,"I hate employers asking for this, in many states it's not even legal anymore.  Their intention is to use your previous pay as a basis for what you'll be paid now.    In your position with a job loss coming you'll have to make the decision about whether it's worth saying no and potentially losing out on an offer.  When I used to have to give this information they would only ask for current pay, but they may also want to see what raises you've received over a number of years.  If you do end up giving numbers make sure they are accurate, don't overstate as they could ask for documentation to back up your claims.     This coupled with the ""fourth interview"" would make me think hard about this employer.  Unless this is a very high level position 4 interviews is excessive in my opinion.

Edit:  It really depends on how marketable your skills are and if you have other potential offers whether you can still negotiate.  I have never seen an employer ask for this information that didn't try to only give me a few thousand over my current pay even when market pay was higher.You’re in IT, there are plenty of job openings out there. I personally would walk if a company asked for a comprehensive salary history. Asking about previous jobs is fine, asking previous/current salary is already pretty iffy, but asking to detail what you made is only going to be used against you in this process. It’s a flag that they want to pay as little as possible.

Edit: this is just a personal opinion. Obviously OP should do what he/she wants. If they’ve made it 4 rounds, they must like OP, so if they decline the salary question, they might still be hired. But again, this isn’t a hard rule, just how I feel.Unless it was for a background check with the government, I’m of the firm belief that salary history is a private matter. It’s all too easy for a prospective employer to lowball the offer if they have that information.

This is such an issue to some regions that several states and municipalities have outright banned prospective employers from asking about salary history until after a firm offer with proposed salary has been made. In North Carolina, private companies are allowed to ask, but state agencies have been prohibited from doing so and pointing this out may get them to see how inappropriate this practice is.

Ultimately, you’ll have to decide what boundaries you find acceptable.I’d just be honest and say it’s not something you want to share.  

It’s only part of your compensation package. If you’re coming from a company with excellent benefits and going to one with crap benefits, for example, you might want a much higher salary.  

It’s not unreasonable to just ask for what you think you’re worth.Answer that question by saying: ""At my next job I expect to be making between XX and YY dollars.""

PERIOD.  You do NOT have to disclose previous income, nor should you.  Remember these are POTENTIAL employers, meaning: total strangers.  If they press simply say ""I do not disclose private information like this"".

It is absolutely none of their business, and any decent employer should understand this.

Edit: I hired a guy once, and he was \*seriously\* underpaid at his previous job.  I wanted him, and wanted to keep him long term, so I brought his wage up to the standard of the rest of the team.  He \*very stupidly\* filled out the employment form stating what he actually make at his previous job.  
I got chewed out by my manager for giving the guy a pay bump.

Just imagine getting hired onto a team and realize you make 20% less than your peers because the CEO is a cheap, opportunist, POS. (Hint, protect yourself from these people).

The lesson I learned: Never fill out the employment form and answer innapropriate questions like that.I'd provide them a nicely formatted document with your references and your *desired compensation*. Providing salary history is a nonstarter for me but I'd just give them a number to start negotiations at.Just do some extra research on the range of salaries in that position. Be honest. This doesn’t affect negotiation power necessarily. Every job I’ve applied for asks for this information too. 

Are you worried you made too much or too little on the last job? Typically companies look for those who are over qualified - they do not want these people.Controversial opinion: lie. 

Find the salary range for that position in your area, and say your current salary is smack-dab in the middle. But only if that number is higher than your current salary, in which case, tell the truth.If they have no way actually access your old salaries, I would be honest (if those were salaries you're fine with)  or beef them up a bit to match what you're worth. Or you could be an absolute mad lad and ask what the salary history is for this position.From my experience, I'd recommend providing it if you are currently paid well above average given your years of experience to prevent them from wasting your time. Otherwise, don't provide those details.",1611666613.0

Firstly, it’s a great method and gets you to think about your money in a different way than just a $ in $ out mindset. 

Secondly, not gonna lie, sometimes I get busy and tired and don’t want to budget. But the fact that I shelled out $84 for it guilts me into using it and keeping up with it.

Really I'm looking for a way to start making money on the side of my main job right now, I already have a selling business and am thinking of getting a second job soon too while my current job is good (to me) I'm not too too in a rush but $10/hour plus tips can only get me so far you know and at 20 years old I feel like so much pressure like I should have 15k in my account rn and have my own house etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5sfv8/i_want_to_start_investingbuying_stocks_help_or/,"Hi! I’d you haven’t already, try reading the sidebar! You want to start with an emergency fund first before you invest any money, and be sure to have defined goals :) 

Picking stocks is a lot like gambling, and it is very difficult to make money from it. Unless you are not worried about the risk or willing to do the research about stocks, please consider options like IRAs and 401ks and through those, target-date funds and index funds. 

Some of those words may be foreign to you. I know they were to me, but take some time to google those things and again, I can’t recommend enough reading the sidebar and the wiki for this subreddit. There is a great amount of knowledge for you to learn! If you have any questions, I’d happily try to lead you in the right direction. 

Just be sure you always have enough money saved for emergencies, always! You’re doing great asking finance questions at your age and with some reading and some diligence, you will be leaps and bounds ahead of your peers! 😄Congratulations in your decision to start investing.  I suggest you sit down and take into account all your expenses and all your income to determine how much money you can afford to set aside for the future that your immediate needs do not require.  Investing is far more complicated than just simply picking a stock.  There are a lot of factors to consider.  Once you determine how much you can allocate for investing, then you can begin to think about the type of investment account you want to start.  Since you are just getting started with your life, this is a good time to start setting aside funds.  If your cash flow is limited, then you might consider setting aside 10% of each of your net paychecks for your investing project.  Think about what you want to focus on like saving money for a house or car as opposed to setting up a retirement account, both are important.  Keep it simple in the beginning, focus on a single project to begin.  Open a regular bank savings account and start setting money aside until you accumulate the $15k, then begin to invest some of it, leaving enough cash in reserve to meet your living expenses for 6 months in case of an economic emergency.  That is what I suggest you consider to get yourself started.  If you want to get ""your feet wet"" investing, consider stating out with a mutual fund where you can invest monthly a small amount or if you have a single stock you favor, opening an account at its Transfer Agent and start investing in that one stock every month.  That is what I suggest for now.You may find these links helpful:

19,Car crapped out on me and my girlfriend today. We still owe 6k on it. Repairs will cost at least that. What should we do?,Part of me wants to say to abandon the car and payments and get a new car. Not like brand new but a newer car and just take the hit on our credit. Is there another option? We need a car to get to work. We've got about 2400 in the bank and don't have too many bills besides her insurance and car payment.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5teby/car_crapped_out_on_me_and_my_girlfriend_today_we/,"1) How many estimates did you get for the repair cost? Maybe it won't really cost $6k

2) ask the shops or wrecking yards if they will buy it and, if so, how much? If you can get 4 or 5k for the car as is, it might be worth it do that, pay it off, and start over with another car.Independent mechanic here.  If the car is relatively well maintained and in otherwise decent shape, you should absolutely fix it, because there is no fucking way it should cost 6 grand.  Any reputable independent shop should be able to put in a used transmission and remanufactured alternator for less than half of that.  What kind of car is it?  Year, make, model, how many miles?I had a 2011 VW that had been paid off for many years. In 2019, it crapped out on me. It was going to be around 3-4K to fix which wasn’t much less than it was worth at the time. I called the Volkswagen dealership and inquired about a trade in and filled them in on the work that needed to be done. (Car was at a shop, not the dealership) They were willing to give me a little less than what it was worth, but more than the repairs would be. Traded it to them for a lease on a 2019. They said it would cost them much less to fix it at the dealership and still be able to resell it and make some money. I was itching for a new car anyways so it turned out to be a great deal. Long story short... maybe a chevy dealership could offer some kind of trade in for you?Can you afford a newer car that will be reliable. I’ve seen a lot of people buy vehicles at quick lots/low or no credit. Those cars tend to end up with expensive repairs in 6 months, due to shoddy owners, poor maintenance, or shoddy repairs from the shop selling the car (or the chain of auction/shop/et cetera). A dead giveaway is mismatched or off brand tires. 

So my question is can you afford or finance a truly reliable vehicle that meets your needs? If not, stick with the devil you know.Do you know what is wrong with it exactly? Most of the time a shop will give you an estimate that’s ridiculously high. Often you can get it going for a very small portion of that.

20,Charged $22k for 3 hour ER visit with no admission,"I went to the ER for extreme abdominal pain, got some labs done and a CT scan and they found out I had a kidney stone and sent me home. Just got the bill and it was $22k to insurance and $4,500 to me.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/personalfinance) if you have any questions or concerns.*You have a HDHP, this amount owed is likely your deductible - you need to contact your insurance company first and ask them to walk you through the claim. You can’t get the benefits of of HDPD without owing a large bill like this (or lots of small little ones) before your coverage kicks in. 

Once you’ve confirmed that this is your deductible, contact the hospital’s billing department and ask what your options are. They will work with you to get it paid off on a zero interest payment plan.Ask for bills with breakdown of what the costs are. Check for mistakes or double charges. Call your insurance and ask why your portion is so high. Then go to financial services at the hospital and negotiate the bill. That's insane even for american standards. Your insurance may be able to negotiate some of it but you can also negotiate your portion with the hospital.Be aware that this is almost certainly not your only bill.  You'll have lab fees, physician charges, and fees from the radiologist separate.Does the amount the EOB says you owe match the amount the hospital bill says you owe?  Sometimes facilities bill for things that are included in the coding definition of other things, and insurance will deny the ""extra"" lines as a result (but you won't be liable for those amounts either).  Often there will be a note on the EOB saying this is what's happening.  The hospital can just see them as denied and claim you're responsible for those too (which you wouldn't be per their contract with the ins co).  I hope this makes sense.  I can explain it better if needed but if the EOB owed amount matches the hospital bill amount then you may really owe the $4500 due to the HDHP.  Definitely call your ins co and ask for a walkthrough regardless.22K? That's bananas.

Besides what others have said, HDHP should have a yearly OOP maximum (i.e. the max you would pay in any given year). Check that.Yes that is accurate for ER kidney stone if you are in the USA. I had kidney stone in ER 3 years ago in Los Angeles with CT scan that wasn't even done right that caused initial mis diagnosis of just ""muscle pain"" despite being crouched in tears hardly able to walk and I walked out with a 24k bill, after insurance it was 3.5k for me. (and I tried going to urgent care first and was moved to ER, kidney stones are terrible).

Long story short I got the right diagnosis from my doctor the next day who re did the labwork and worked at the same hospital as that ER and despite my doctor advocating for me the scan wasn't done right the hospital refused to take it off. I'm assuming out of fear to admit they were wrong fear of being sued. Unless you lawyer up $$$, you got to pay it.

You can contact the billings department at the hospital and ask for financial aid. There, you will fill out an application and write  letter stating your financial hardships. I heard some people get discounted on their bill, but that wasn't the case for me. But what they did offer which I believe they have to when you apply for financial aid is set up an interest free payment plan. So I did that at the lowest possible amount I could afford to be petty.Typically the way high deductible health plans work is you are 100% responsible up to the deductible, then you pay 10%-20% of all charges untill you hit your out of pocket maximum. Find out what both of those numbers are for sure. You also said you haven't gotten a bill yet and only EOBs, you'll get bills in the mail and probably a lot of them, you'll want to go line by line on all the charges to make sure they're valid and they match the EOB. The insurance company should help you understand the charges since they don't want to be paying the $17k either.

Once everything is sorted out you can work with the hospital to get a payment plan. You can also add $3600 total including your company's contributions (more if married or over 55) to your HSA which will save you some money by it not being taxed. 

The good news (if there is any) here is that if anything else happens for the rest of the plan year, you'll only paying the 10%-20% coinsurance since you met your deductible.

By no means did you do anything wrong here and this may be unavoidable but try really hard in the future to go to an urgent care center over an emergency room if there's one open near you. I would only go to an ER if I'm shot or having a stroke.

Edit: you can add $3550 towards you 2020 hsa limit by 4/15/21 (or when you file taxes). Contact your HSA provider for how to do it before you file your taxes. I don't know what tax bracket or state you're in but this could probably save you about $900 on your taxes.That’s why you better be sure you’re dying before going to the emergency room.",1611707441.0
21,"One Man Business, how can I lower tax burden (401k, ira, etc)","I am a one man business who provides a service for other small businesses. I have a few very good customers in my area.

I currently just pay myself when the company has money, and I pay taxes.

I have business expenses and obviously write those off each year. I have other personal writeoffs each year for mortgage interest, property taxes, lots of charitable donations, etc.

I know if I made this same amount working for a bigger company as an employee, I'd probably be able to stuff aside some of my income into an IRA, 401k and other options that would help reduce my tax burden. Right now I just have some extra money saving up in my accounts and I pay full taxes. 

I'm not trying to hide or cheat out of anything, but I want to take advantage of the perfectly moral and legal options available to me.

What are my best options?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5ok5r/one_man_business_how_can_i_lower_tax_burden_401k/,"You could establish a SEP IRA or solo 401k.

Also, don't forget about the [self-employed health insurance deduction](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/home-ownership/deducting-health-insurance-premiums-if-youre-self-employed/L6bRhLaVE) and the [qualified business income deduction](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/qualified-business-income-deduction).To start with, you can contribute to a personal IRA--whether traditional or roth or a combination of both.  As long as you have earned income, you can contribute.  If you want your contributions to reduce your taxes however, they need to be traditional IRA contributions.

Next there is your employer sponsored plans.  Being self employed, you can open and contribute to either a solo/individual 401K, SEP IRA or SIMPLE IRA.  Of the three, the solo/individual 401K is the superior retirement vehicle.  Just be mindful you cannot have any full time employees (those working 1000 hours or more) with the exception of a spouse.  And once you reach $250K in assets, you need to file form 5500 each year.

Now unfortunately for you, the deadline to setup a solo 401K so you could still contribute for tax year 2020 was Dec 31, 2020.  At this point, your next choice is either a SEP or SIMPLE IRA.  Depending on your income, one or the other will allow for you to contribute more.  Unless you have a very high income, a SIMPLE IRA is likely the best choice.  If you decide to open and contribute to a SIMPLE IRA for the 2020 tax year, you have until April 15, 2021 to open and contribute to it.  Just know that there is a 2 year wait period before you can roll it over into another account.  But I would just contribute for 2020 and then open a solo 401K for 2021 and use that.  Then wait until the grace period elapses and roll it over.

Lastly you could use a health savings account if you're enrolled in a HSA compatible high deducible health plan.  If you are enrolled, you can contribute to a health savings account (I would recommend opening one with Fidelity or Lively as those two are the only HSAs that charge no admin fees, fees to trade or require minimum cash balance).

After that you can use a taxable brokerage for long term savings/investments, though you won't have any tax savings.

Also when making contributions, be mindful of the qualified business income deduction.  If you are making any traditional and roth contributions, try to do the traditional in your personal IRA and the equivalent roth in your solo 401K so that it doesn't reduce your taxable business income.  Personal income tax wise, it doesn't matter as your personal income tax rate is the same.  However, by having a higher business tax income you'll get a higher QBID and thus pay less taxes on your business income and thus less taxes overall.

Edit: One last thing you can possibly do to reduce taxes is depending on how much income you net and the type of business you're doing, you may be able to save on the 15.3% self employment tax by filing as an S-Corp--either outright incorporating as an S-Corp or forming a single member LLC and electing to file as an S-Corp with the IRS.  This last method is much simpler.  Anyway the way this works is if you can reasonable pay yourself a wage less than your total net income that is congruent with industry norms, you can take the difference as stock distributions which aren't subject to self employment tax.  So for example, say you are a programmer and sell a mobile app.  You net $200K.  As a sole proprietor that entire $200K is subject to SE Tax, which is around $30K.  But if you were filing as an S-Corp ad the going rate of a programmer is say $100K, you can pay yourself the wage of $100K and pay SE tax on that $100K and then take the remaining $100K as distributions, thus saving yourself $15K.  Whether this is worth to do depends on how much income you can reasonably shelter.  The trade off is you'll get a lower social security payout, but if you invest the difference you'll come out way ahead.

Another thing to note, is if you're a very high income earner, you may want to look into setting up a solo 401K that allows after tax contributions so you can do a mega backdoor roth.Check out options for a Solo 401K or SEP IRA; whether this makes sense for you, and how to optimize. You may need to consult a CPA or tax professional for best results.anyone can setup an IRA, you don't need to be traditionally employed. talk to a financial advisor or your bank and they can help you get started.",1611697574.0
22,A hint for people with families/cultures that expect too much sharing: hire a financial planner,"Pro-tip from an old fart who's seen a lot of threads on here where one family member is finally making a good salary -- and wants to help -- but others don't understand what's prudent:

Go see a pro. Even if it's just once, even if it's a mall kiosk or online YouTube video series. Tell everyone you're doing it, that you're getting professional advice on *how to make a long-range plan that will help the most over time*.

Then when someone you love wants you to buy them a $$$ flat screen and you *know* that money is better off in the RothIRA, don't tell them *you* know it -- tell them 

""The financial advisor said I need to be putting X plan into place if we all want to be secure in the long run, and this doesn't fit the plan"".

or even -- ""Gee, I've got everything set up on autopay so I can't possibly mess it up, and there just isn't enough in that account.""

In cultures that value age/experience, where you've got older people pressuring (you) the younger ones, passing the buck to an outside authority figure -- or settled *plan* --  can sometimes cut through a lot of stressful family dynamics.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l4ptdl/a_hint_for_people_with_familiescultures_that/,"Also works great when you have family or friends who always want you to invest in some business venture... simply saying “send over the business plan and projections and I will review with my advisor” kills 99% of begging.


Particularly useful when large variances in financial common sense existNot unlike what parents often tell their teenage kids: 

""Tell them your mother won't let you, if that means your friends will get off your back about something you don't want to do.""I can’t speak for all cultures but i can speak for the indian culture that I am part of. Here’s what will happen when i tell that “my financial advisor said to put x plan in place if we all want to be secure in the long run and it doesn’t fit the plan.”

Parents: “oh so now you value some strangers advice over family huh?”

Me: “this stranger has a fiduciary duty to serve in my best interest/ has a degree to prove he knows what he’s doing etc.”

Parents : “You didn’t go see his/her credentials or degree. Family should always come first no matter what. There shouldn’t be my money or your money in a family—it’s all ours. We starved so you could study, we did all this for you and this is how you repay us by listening to a stranger and turning your back on us???”

Me in my head: “I didn’t ask you to birth me when it was financially challenging to raise a kid, it was your decision, You can’t use that over me!”

Parents continuing: “we see you’ve disowned us blah blah...”

These guys will always try and use emotional blackmailing. While it deeply hurts, I’ve found it’s easier to just not disclose the true figures. If emotionally tortured to do so, lie. Deflate your salary and inflate your expenses. Whine about how you always never have any money left over.An easier way to navigate this is to either downplay your financial status to your family, or don't disclose this information at all.I won money on a TV game show several years ago and found this idea helpful. A few extended family members and coworkers either outright asked for money or cracked tasteless jokes about how I should pay for stuff, and I simply answered, ""My money has been invested and I don't have access to it right now."" Repeat ad nauseum.I will be anyone's excuse for not giving their money family. Just say /u/wilsonhammer said that money's already planned for!I once got out of being made the primary borrower for a huge overseas education loan for a relative by saying that my advisor told me it would be too much debt since I already had a huge home loan. 
It was for a relative who was running a business and all his money was off the books so he would not get a loan. So he would have sent me money every month to repay the instalments. 
Unfortunately, he died a few years later, much before said loan would be paid. 
This recommendation really works!Tip part 2: Go once and then just keep using the excuse to save on $ going to the financial plannerIt's a good idea to put the onus on someone or something else.  Like pointing to a document and saying ""it's not in the plan"" draws the attention away from you to the document and makes the document the bad guy, not you.Also  go to a therapist and get empowered to say no.   Saying no to family that thinks you Owe them because you are family or they try and guilt you is liberating.  
You do not owe them a big screen TV.   You owe yourself and your wife/child (if you have those) to succeed and have a home and food.  You do not owe your brother a TV set, you don't owe your mother a new car.   If it's not extra money that you can throw away gambling or burn in a pile, then you don't give it to someone else just because they find it's easy to guilt trip you into spending it on them or giving it to them.  


I have a great friend that was guilt tripped into buying a bigger house because his parents said he should have a p\[permanent place for them so they don't have to get a hotel room.  He got a place with an extra room and they scolded him that it should have a private bath and kitchen.

25,"Where do you start with Care Credit, and what do you know before you actually get the account?","Here’s a bit of background:

I am trying to pay for top surgery because my insurance explicitly denies trans coverage. The cost will be about $12,000. From what all I can find on the site, it is possible to get 60 months through Care Credit for purchases above $2500, but I don’t see where that can be done or how. Really I don’t see any advice other than “Apply today!” for where to start.

So in order to do this, do I apply for Care Credit at the surgeon’s office to get “promotions” (because I read about there being promotions that exist for Care Credit but not where to find them)? Will I know what I am approved for (aka will I know if I got approved for 60 months) before it actually opens? Calling Care Credit themselves only had the options of “Apply now” or “Put in your account number to proceed” so there was no option to talk to a representative without putting in an account number. 

I have pretty good credit (high 600s, was 770 before student loan accounts opened) and I’m very good with money, and I’m aware of the “catch” with Care Credit/deferred interest. But I can’t for the life of me find where to start?

Edit: I posted the reason for necessity just to give context, I don’t need a lecture on whether or not I need the surgery, thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5ok1c/where_do_you_start_with_care_credit_and_what_do/,"I used it to cover a vet surgery for my dog. Download the app. Enter your info. The app asks how much you are looking for and if approved they will only give you a limit of that much unless you ask for more later. It was pretty immediate that I found out I was accepted. A few minutes I think is all it tookI work at an ENT office that accepts care credit. I don’t know all the ins and out of our companies contract with care credit but I know a little bit. For our patients who do care credit all they do is apply online (not sure exactly what the process entails but it does not take very long) but then care credit gives you a card number and a credit limit. 
While the website says you can get up to 60 months, that’s not always the case and I believe that is up to the practice and their care credit contract. For some services if someone at our office pays with care credit, it only goes up to 24 months. So that may be a question to ask the surgeons office how long it would be.
When you pay, you give the cashier the card number and they have to long on to the care credit website and enter the payment. At that point they will click the monthly period. (The website limits it so our max period is 24 months)
I would recommend calling your surgeons office and asking themMost purchases are 6 months deferred interest. And that i can check after i make the purchase. It shows up on the account and I can click it and check when the promotional deferred interest expires.Also something to be aware of is that the care credit is not a credit card. It is not a Visa or Mastercard or anything. It is its own entity and as such the place you are going to have the procedure needs to accept ""care credit"" as a payment optionHi! - I think it depends on the purchase amount, but I think the minimum purchase amount is $200 to be eligible for promo financing. Then it might be up to the provider as to which promo they offer based on the total purchase price. They've always been pretty liberal with my limit, too. I just asked for an increase since we might have some dental work coming up and it got instantly approved. 

Good luck!!!it's pretty straightforward, and the best way to get more info is to just start the process. yes, you'll find out what you're approved for and the interest rate along with any promotional periods. separately, consider that many women are quite happy with very small tops, and can't afford breast augmentation even if they wanted larger breasts. gender isn't about what you have on your chests, it's fundamentally about who you are. consider that before spending so much money on something. true happiness comes from within, you don't need greedy surgeons selling you something that won't fundamentally change anything about you. and as far as insurance coverage, it's fair for them to deny it. it opens up a slippery slope of covering cosmetic procedures for anyone who doesn't feel their appearance matches their identity for nearly any reason. that would be financially unsustainable and fundamentally bad for society, so don't take it personally that it's being denied. best of luck on your journey!",1611697565.0

31,Help with getting late payment removed from credit report,"So I’ve had a really good credit score for a while (750+), had at least 1 credit card since I was 20 (almost ten years), and up until the end of last year I’ve made on time payments over 370 times.  Then, last fall I ordered Postmates. I handed my phone around so people could order what they want and then left the room and when I came back my fiancé said she couldn’t pay with Apple Pay (needed to pass the Face ID), so she just used the card I had saved on the Postmates app. I figured “ok cool, no big deal it’s probably just my debit card” because I that’s how I have it set up on all my other delivery apps. I don’t think anything of it until I checked my score recently.

It dropped by over 80 points. It turns out the card saved on the Postmates app was for a credit card from a regional bank (a region that I no longer live in) that I never use, never check, and that I don’t have auto pay set up with because it won’t let me link an outside bank account to pay the balance (I used to have a checking account with them and would have to transfer money to that account every time to pay it). Every time I want to pay the balance on this card I have to call and give them my checking account over the phone, so naturally I never use this card.

They reported it as 30 days late, and when I called to pay off the balance and see if there was anything they could do about the report they said no dice, try filing a dispute with the credit bureau. 

Am I just totally fucked here? Is this one stupid mistake of not paying this balance that I didn’t even know existed really going to ding my credit like that, because I’ve now made on time payments 371/372 times?

32,Should I pay collections or dispute the debt?,"So I checked my credit report and my score dropped pretty dramatically. It turns out I have a derogatory mark due to a debt going to collections.

It turns out it is a small medical bill from 11 months ago that I never paid. I didn't remember ever receiving the bill, so when I asked the agent how they contacted me about it they said a letter was sent to my address. It turns out that the address they had on file was one that I haven't lived at in over 7 years....

It is a small amount ($157) and I am able to pay it, but I'm not sure how that will affect my score as I am unfamiliar with how derogatory marks on credit work.

Currently, adding federal taxes to my paychecks wouldn't hurt me at all per pay period but I am trying to figure out the pros and cons besides just paying a chunk of money at the end of the year versus the government siphoning money from me each paycheck.

It may be just a preference thing, or maybe it's cheaper in the long run to do either or. I am not a tax person, nor financial brainiac so I am just trying to maybe understand from people who have a better idea.

EDIT: Fixed some wording, because I am an idiot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5mtvi/better_to_withhold_federal_tax_in_your_paycheck/,"If you underpay by a certain amount, the IRS can actually fine you at some point. But generally it’s easier (from a budgeting and cash flow standpoint) to pay as you go to avoid coming up with large amounts at the end of the year.Look up the IRS underpayment penalty.  I’m pretty sure that if you don’t ask the government to withhold the money for you, you’ll need to pay quarterly estimates tax payments or face penalties — as well as a large tax bill — in April.If you're not a tax person like you said, I would opt in to federal withholding. If not, you will have to remember to pay quarterly tax payments in order to ensure you are not faced with penalties for underpayments.

You're correct in thinking about pros and cons in that there are opportunity costs in withholding too much (interest free loan to government) but overall much safer and easier to just opt in to withholding and most likely receive a small refund at end of year.I don’t think I understand your question - they are withholding taxes but you have the option for them to withhold more? Or they are NOT withholding but you can opt in?

Either way, just know if they are not withholding or not withholding enough that you will need to pay estimated taxes by quarter or you will owe fee/interest.I think maybe there's some confusion with the terminology. ""Withheld"" means you *are* paying federal income tax. A portion of your paycheck is set aside (withheld) and sent to the IRS on your behalf by your employer.It is easiest to have them take it out. If you get a refund and your contract goes on for years you can always adjust the amount so they only take out close the amount you would owe.

If our family were to fill out w4 withholding right we would put a 4. I found through the years that 8 is great and still get $1,000 to $2,000 back and never owe. Used to get $8,000 refunds which is nice but just gave the government a free loan for a year.I would just have your client (not your employer, BTW, but that's just me being pedantic -- it sounds like you're self employed so you are your own employer) submit payments for you via withholding. The IRS is a pay as you go system: if your client doesn't submit payments on your behalf, you have to do it. Although not every pay period - just 4x a year. But you have to run Schedule ES every time to figure out how much to pay, and that's more work. Plus you may screw it up and owe underpayment penalties.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It depends on what your health needs are likely to be.  If you are physically healthy and won't likely need any care, other than the counseling the HSA is the better deal.  You could use part of the amount they contribute for your mental health care and pocket the rest if you don't have any other needs.  PPOs often have these amounts for office visits as you show for mental health were the HSA plan you may be on your own until you hit the deductible.  Compare other parts of both plans as well, often out of of network will be different between plans.  Are they both offered by the same insurance company?  I assume you are single?For 25/pp these are both very good. Your employer is probably paying \~750 per month for these. 

In general I'd say take the HSA plan, it has effectively (if you use the entire 1500 HSA contribution each year) 1500 max OOP per year, which is really good. However, the PPO isn't too bad either with 1750 max per year and the 20/visit on mental health seems like a really good bargain, especially if that's your main anticipated usage of the plan. 

However - it would be useful to know what your anticipated frequency of usage and expected cost for the mental health visits would be. If it's say, 200 per visit twice per month then yeah, you're paying the full 1500-3000 in the HSA plan (depending on whether you want to keep their 1500 invested) versus 480 in the PPO which is a big difference. If the visits are less expensive, or less frequent, and the numbers get significantly closer, I would suggest the HSA because then you can invest a bit in that plan each month if you'd like.

Pretax money invested earlier is going to compound better than savings.I would max out 401k contributions and put 6-12 months of expenses into a hysa as an emergency fund before paying down the mortgage.  If you can do those things and still have cash you don't need for expenses, then sure, pay off/down the mortgage.No. You should focus on your retirement contributions because the interest gained on those will likely be much greater than 4%.

Personally, I would try to pay off my mortgage right around the time I am planning to retire. 

Great work taking advantage if your new investment opportunities btw.What's the interest percentage on the mortgage?  
Definitely need to increase your contribution to play a bit of catch-up if the annual limit allows based on your salary.You should talk to your bank about refinancing your mortgage to under 3% and put whatever savings you have from that into your retirement. Your bank should lower it without costs to you because they don't want you going to a different bank.Depends what the interest rate on the mortgage is. There's no real reason to pay off a mortgage today, but it's something to keep in mind once you actually stop working and your income goes away. You can save some as an emergency fund, invest some, and perhaps do some IRA contributions as well if you either qualify for a tradition IRA deduction or if you can do backdoor Roth. (be careful about backdoor roth if you have any existing IRA funds though...)

You could start paying a bit more each month on the mortgage if you want to hedge against a stock market downturn, but if you suddenly spend most of your available cash and have some unexpected expenses come along your lack of mortgage isn't going to help you pay those bills.You may find these links helpful:

42,Check my math: Should I pay off my car now and focus on saving for a home?,"I bought a car last year and financed for 60 months at 4.87%. I'm bad at math and figuring out when different accounts compound or accrue interest, so I used a few different calculators I found online.

My main financial goal is saving for a down payment on a house (3% down on a \~$300k home+closing costs=\~$20k) in the next 4-5 years.

I have an HYSA account with .5% APY where I have a bucket for home savings and a bucket for emergency savings. I probably keep too much in my checking account. My job is pretty stable and I have a strong support network, so I'm considering a smaller emergency fund. Essential monthly expenses= $1400. Take-home pay= $3344/mo (expect 5% raise annually)

* Did I do the math roughly right? Are there different calculators I should use?
   * For savings calculations, I used [NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/savings-calculator) (for HYSA interest) and again, [NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/auto-loans/car-loan-calculator) (for auto loan)

45,"Financial, domestic issues. Need advice on how to proceed.","Good evening reddit,

I am 33M and I moved to Houston, Texas in January 2020 and began the electrical trade. I totaled my car in May. I have been getting to work with my cousin who i live with as well who drives a work truck for the company. So we are around each other day in and out.

My cousin is a marine veteran and has PTSD. He gets angry very easily. Well it got to the point where we were in an argument about tools which led to me getting punched in the face at work. He isn't fired, I took vacation to work on my car. My boss wants to separate us at work but that would require me to find a ride/finish fixing car.

The car (honda civic 2013) was given to me by my mom after she paid it off. It has a side collision on the passenger wheel/fender area. I have the axle and wheel removed. I need to buy a steering knuckle so I can reinstall the steering system and get it running/see what else it needs.

My problem is that we are behind on this month's rent which was due the 1st. I have had my side of rent ready but I can't pay the rent if he doesn't have his. I made an arrangement to pay January and February's rent on the 3rd of Feb. About $900 each. He said he will have his portion.

My lease is up in 60 days so I plan to end it and send the notice here tomorrow.

I have tried to help my cousin despite his struggles with emotions and finance. Help by putting my name on the lease because he has a record.  Taking care of his dog by walking him every day because he is heavier set and struggles with his lower back slipped disc. Doing whatever I can to help, but I feel he has taken advantage of me. He always asks me for money when he makes more than me. He never cleans, and I feel I have made a mistake coming here.

I plan to move back to florida in April. I would like to know if anyone has any strategies on how to get out of this situation. I have 200$ on cashapp, my bank is negative 180. I get a direct deposit of 350 tomorrow evening from work. I missed a day of work so this check is short because I fell on a roof doing side work for a PAST DEBT of his and landed on a roof beam and had to get staples.

I know I am placing a lot of blame on him when I am the one who committed to these terms. I don't want to break the lease and ruin my credit for 7 years. I was relying on the second stimulus check to come in but it didn't come in and the IRS says my second payment status is unavailable and I received the first. I didn't work in 2019 enough to file taxes so I'm thinking that's it. I plan to file taxes the 12th of Feb when the IRS is ready.

Can anyone give me advice on a path I can take? The stress has fogged me and the family I have reached out to is all in Florida and not really able to help. A

Is this how it is typically done? Of course I will change my password now but I think I never should have given it out. What say you guys?,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5l5o0/rollover_manager_wanted_my_bank_password/,"Never, ever, give out any password. Especially your bank password.

Of course I told them a hard no and had them do it themselves at a later time when they’re able.

Immediately change the password and I would strongly caution against working with someone with that type of ethics going forward.Your manager is either 1) lazy and doesn't want to explain the information he/she wants, or 2) crooked, and plans to misuse the information. Neither is appropriate. 

Never give out your password. EVER.Never should have given it out. Opened yourself up for fraudulent actions.Does this guy work for Fidelity?  File a complaint with them, it is guaranteed that he is violating their procedures.  And change your bank password.Look....is this something you really have to ask?

I would NEVER give my password to anyone I don't know or trust. That includes my account manager for my own assets. There are countless ways for them to obtain the information that they need WITHOUT your password.

My stocks portfolio is 35% Technology (TSLA, GOOGL (fractional), NVDA), 30% Healthcare (MRNA, PFE, GLD), 20% Consumer Goods (BLNK, BABA), 15% Business (PLTR, TCEHY). Value is about $5k.

My Roth IRA account is through American Funds and is in the following mutual funds: GWPAX, AMCPX, NEWFX. Value is about $6k. My financial advisor basically just picked these MFs for me because they are good stable funds that will grow over time (im 29, got about 35 years til I retire).

So im thinking of cashing out some if not most of my stocks and contributing it into my Roth IRA account. However if I do this what are the tax implications on both cashing out the stock and then contributing $5k into my Roth IRA all at once?

Also any other recommendations for better mutual funds for the Roth IRA? I'm willing to invest in a little riskier funds given that I have time on my side to recover if it goes sideways. Or even a better broker than American Funds as i'm not particularly fond of them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5pthd/should_i_cash_out_my_5k_in_stocks_and_put_it_into/,"Switch brokers for your IRA. You're currently getting put into expensive, high-fee funds.

Go with Vanguard, Schwab, or Fidelity instead.I would do it dude. You can’t make up lost roth contributionsWhen you sell in the taxable account you will realize a gain and that is a taxable event. Sounds like these would be long term gains. Long term gains get a preferential tax treatment.In your very specific shoes (because it's been more than a year since purchase of the American Funds), I would recommend you rollover the Roth IRA to a Roth IRA account at Fidelity and buy FZROX, because it is the Platonic Ideal of Low Cost (it's expense ratio is 0) and Diversified (it's the whole stock market). I would put future contributions there first.   
Other brokers (Schwab and Vanguard, for example) are fine. Other funds are fine. But the aim is LOW COST and DIVERSIFIED (e.g. <0.2% ER and >300 stocks)  
For the Robinhood account, you might want to hold everything for at least a year, so you have to deal with Long Term Capital Gains, not Short Term. It's approximately the same amount of paperwork, I think? But definitely a lower rate for long term.  


If Robinhood is interesting, keeping the account isn't the problem. But you want individual stock picks to be no more than 5% of your total.Like others have said, move IRA to a cheaper brokerage, with funds that have a lower ER.  For reference, Schwab's SWPPX S&P500 index fund has a .02% ER vs AMCPX is .69%.  You still have time to contribute to your IRA for 2020 tax year.  Max for 2020 and 2021 is $6k.  
If you cash out your individual holdings, you will have to pay taxes on the capital gains.  Short vs long term capital gains will depend on how long you've held the positions for.I would keep the robinhood account as is and start to save up to contribute to Roth IRA. If you sell your robinhood now, you would have to pay taxes on it, especially if it's short term capital gains tax vs long term. Plus, these individual stocks are in decent companies with the potential to continue growing. Selling it now would make you lose money in 1) taxes and 2) future growth.

52,Tricky auto insurence situation,"Hey everyone! So, I have been driving for 12-years and got into my first car accident yesterday. It was very minor - I backed into someone else's vehicle in a parking lot. I'm at fault here. What's tricky to me is I'm not sure whether I should use insurance or not. Here's why:

I was driving my girlfirend's car (with her permission). We both have GEICO. Not knowing how auto insurance works, I initially filed this through my policy on the scene. The next day, GEICO called and I was instructed that my gf would need to file it under her policy as it was her car. So we filed it under her insurence.

She has $1,000 deductible on collision and no deductible, full coverage on liability. I was speaking to my coworker about this and he advised that I settle this outside of insurance so my gf's rate wouldn't go up as the damage was minor and would likely cost less than the premium increase overtime. I called the man who's vehicle I hit, discussed these options with him, and he got a quote for the damages on his car, around $600 which is reasonable. My gf's car will need some painting on the bumper as well.

We discussed the possibility of just not going through insurance with GEICO, asking if we could just cancel the claims. They said we could, but it wouldn't change anything because they had been aware of the accident the rates may still go up. They also told us that they don't know for sure *if* the rates will go up, and *if* they do, how much they would go up by. 

In terms of accident forgiveness, my gf hasn't been in an accident in 5-years but was ""forgiven"" for her last accident.

57,ELI5? ESPP - 423(c) and Form 3922,"Hi all,

As the title says, can anybody ELI5 what this all means to me and what the implications are?

TL;DR: First time getting form 3922 for 423(c) ESPP plan, sold first batch of ESPP shares in 2020 as quickly as I could and held on to the second batch of ESPP shares. Previous years I just did quicksell and took the hit to income taxes.

I've been participating in my company's ESPP program purchasing shares with a 2-year window at a 15% discount from market price. Since I started with the company I have been immediately selling the shares and taking a hit on taxes.

In 2020, I sold the shares from the first purchase window but held onto the shares from the second purchase window.

Getting to the title... Today I got a form from ETrade titled ""Transfer of Stock Acquired Through an Employee Stock Purchase Plan Under Section 423(c)"" and indicating it is Form 3922. I've never received this form in the mail before.

On this form I see all of the shares purchased through ESPP in 2020, even the ones that were sold swiftly. Unfortunately both purchase dates happened to fall within a blackout window for earnings announcements, so quick sell was disabled.

What does this form mean to me? What are the tax implications from this form? I have looked up the code but don't understand the implications of it. It doesn't look to me like the numbers on the form would fall under the provisions of 423(c).

* Debt Free besides a Mortgage with around $200k remaining
* $165k in retirement.  
* 6 month Emergency Fund in place.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5r1sc/honoring_my_father/,"You seem to be in great shape financially.  You can afford to use some of your windfall to treat yourself.  Maybe buy a piece of really nice furniture that will last a lifetime and remind you of your father.  Or maybe just buy something nice for your wife and something nice for yourself.  Maybe set aside money for a great vacation when the pandemic ends.

You could also afford to pay some of this forward by donating to charity, maybe a charity your father would have appreciated.

Set aside what you need for taxes on this windfall, which could be hefty.

After that, deposit the maximum amount to your traditional or Roth IRA, and save the rest in a non-tax advantaged account targeted for your retirement.  I suggest a Vanguard index fund because they keep costs low and don't try to beat the market.

I'm sorry for your loss.  Your father raise a remarkable and responsible child.  He must have been a wonderful man.https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfallI’m so sorry for your loss.  Had you father ever expressed anything he wanted you to do with it?  Guessing not, but best to ask, I suppose.

Based on the information you have provided, your father did a great job raising you, and had to have been immensly proud.  
You are close to being able to pay off your home, but you clearly will do well, no matter what you choose.I would consider a lump sum amount into 529. It is transferable and tied to education. Your children would get  to take advantage of a lot of interest growth. 

Your 401k seems light if that's for both you and your wife. 

Or early payoff of your mortgage would probably save you some serious interest (I'm assuming your like 10 years or less in).

Personally, I would do anything that increases your family's stability and your freedom is a great way to honor someone. I would take time off to write down your memories and organize their pictures etc. I feel that a small task a lot of families do not do and those memories/stories kind of get lost to boxes and forgotten.Do you and your spouse have IRAs?

I would put $24 into IRAs.  $6 for your 2020, $6k for spousal 2020. ($6k for your 2021, $6k for spousal 2021)

I would donate a chunk (maybe $10k) to a charity that means something to you or your father in remeberance.

That's only a small portion of this inheritance so you will have to find some other worthwhile uses for it as well, but this is a start.Pay off debt and allow yourself one gift or vacation and put away the rest for an important life goal.Sorry to hear about your loss. And on the bright side im glad to hear about your new born.

If I was in your situation I would start my own business, do something your passionate about,  provide a service and a product that you know is needed.

Then  scale it with the money you got. Get a  website done. Get the suppliers. And start marketing.

Time management is important in business so spend more time on what propels it forward and nothing propels business forward than marketing, sales, and copywriting.

Of course you need to do your market research before investing a dime on the project. You can use free tools like reddit, quora, Google trends etc.

That way you'll know what's trending and what are the hot commodities in your market. You'll beat at the same pulse as the market.

That's just a few things for you to consider.

61,Dividends vs Index investing,"Many people say that dividends do not matter, and I know that the price of the stock drops by the same amount of dividend distributed.

However, if you do a comparison of 2 investors with the same net worth, with one holding only dividend stocks and the other holding a globally diversified index fund, it seems that the dividend investor will get a monthly paycheque forever, while the index investor will one day sell off his last share of the index etf because he has to sell his shares to receive an income. Am I missing something here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5tja7/dividends_vs_index_investing/,"> Am I missing something here?

Yes. The price of shares generally goes up over time so fewer shares will be worth the same amount of money.

Dividends aren't a magical source of free money. Companies paying high dividends do so at the expense of growth which means that their stock prices tend to go up slower than the rest of the stock market. And as an investor, there's no reason to favor one type of return over another. Dividends and capital gains are both taxed at the same rate (in the US, at least) and neither is inherently better for passive income. You're mostly just trading one type of growth for another, but you may be less diversified if you just buy high dividend stocks or high dividend funds.

An important advantage of getting more of your returns in the form of capital gains is that *you* decide when to sell and take capital gains while you're forced to pay taxes frequently with dividends. High dividend funds also tend to be less tax-efficient because more of your return is being taxed along the way. It's generally better to defer taxes until you actually need the money.>Am I missing something here?

you seem to be assuming that dividend payouts are guaranteed, when they arent.

all a dividend distribution is is a forced sale of the asset.  if you own $100 of stock and you get a 10% dividend, you now have $90 of stock and $10 in cash.  the exact same as if you owned $100 of stock with no dividends and sold 10% of your position.

dividend stocks can still lose money, just like non dividend stocks.>it seems that the dividend investor will get a monthly paycheque forever, 

Until the firm stops paying dividends.

That happens more than you might think.You are missing fractional shares, stock splits, and the fact that a diversified index fund still pays dividend. It's just not dividend *focused*.If you're investing for retirement income, one thing to consider is that your tax rate now on dividends is almost certainly higher than it will be when you're retired. This is because your retirement income will be at or below your current income level more than likely. 

You will pay taxes on income, take that net pay to buy stocks, pay taxes on the dividends, and then pay taxes if/when you sell.

If you use tax advantaged accounts like 401k and Roths and pick index funds, you will only pay taxes once (either before you buy or when you sell). And there are ways to never pay taxes on either end.

Head on over to /r/financialindependence to learn more, as I'm not an expert. That sub has a lot of info on how to get to a point where you can generate enough income to retire, either earlier than normal or securely at a more traditional retirement age.When a dividend is paid out, the value of the stock drops.  

I’d rather my dividend paying investments just used spare cash to buy back stock instead of paying dividends.

Looks at IBM stock price on November 9:

115.53

On November 10:

117.91

Difference: $2.38

Dividend for shareholders of record on November 9: $1.63.  

Thus IBM gets nearer to each quarterly ex-dividend date, there is drag on the stock price.

IBM pays 5.5 percent today.  It used to pay 5 percent.  Then the IBM PC cratered and the dividend cratered with it.  They are up to 5.5 percent against because of stock buybacks and changes to the business.

Mathematically selling shares of a blended index fund in retirement makes no difference compared to  a dividend heavy fund.",1611712528.0

64,How do I compare my currently salary and pension to a job without a pension?,"I'm 35 and have been at the same company for 10 years that offers a pension. I currently earn 120k per year.  If I were to quit now, my pension will pay out 1300 a month at 65. If I continue working until 65 and retire, the pension will pay out roughly 10,000 a month (assuming a 3% yearly salary increase). I do not contribute to this at all but I have a separate 401k that I do contribute to up to the company match of 4%.

I'm looking to move on and most companies do not have a pension. How do I compare my currently salary and pension to a job without a pension? I am looking to figure out what my asking salary should be and what I would need to save for retirement to at least match my current pension, but desirably exceed it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l52ayn/how_do_i_compare_my_currently_salary_and_pension/,"This seems like you’re trying to quantify the time -value of a pension that’s 30 years in the future. I would do that by pricing out an annuity, which, like a pension provides a monthly payout for the rest of your life. A quick google search shows an estimate calculator here: https://www.schwab.com/annuities/fixed-income-annuity-calculator

I would run the numbers to see how much it costs to buy an annuity that provides $8700/month, using a birth date of someone who is 65 years old today and wants their payments to start today. The estimate will be at least a million bucks, more if a spouse is involved. 

Then use a compound interest calculator to figure out how much money you need to save on your own if you took the other job to be able to afford to buy that annuity when you turn 65, to guarantee yourself the same payments that the pension would have provided.Something also worth considering is whether your current company will still exist and be in a position to pay out its full pension commitments 30-60 years from now.just remember pensions end at death, a 401k would be given to heirs. Might not matter now but it's a big deal, I also feel the security of pensions might not be 100% in future. 401k is your money, you can access it earlier. My employer matches 10% of our salary, so there might be comparable options out there that would be tempting.It's a relatively simple math problem. If you work for another 30 years you will earn a pension of $8,700 a month (the increase from your current vested $1.3k to $10k.)

$8,700 a month = $104,000 per year.

A estimate often used is that you can withdraw 4% of your 401k per year in retirement. So to support a draw of $104k, you need $2,610,000.

You need to play with a compounded interest calculator to see how to get there. One possible estimate would be by saving $2,300 a month (inclusive of any company match) for 30 years and assuming a 6.5% return (which is a reasonable number to account for growth + inflation).This is a nice tasty time value of money problem. Essentially, you want to quantify your current pension benefit as a lump sum right now versus your possible future benefit as a lump sum right now.

Assuming a 6% return on assets before retirement, 3% inflation, retiring at 65, and living to 85...

The present value of your current pension (present value of an annuity) is $1300 monthly, 6% interest, for 50 years = PV of $246,958.

The present value of your future pension at retirement age is $10000 monthly, 6% interest (probably too high), for 20 years = PV of $1,395,808, but then we need to roll that back for 30 years of inflation. Divide by 1.03 to the 30th power, and the PV today would be $575,054.

OK, great. So the lump sum value of your pension would grow by $328,096. Now to spread that out over your 30 more years of work. 6% interest, 30 years, do a little bit of guess and check, and... The difference comes out to just under $2,000 per month.

Now, that assumes (1) you would stay at your company to 65 and (2) your company would not freeze their pension, which is becoming increasingly common. (Freezing doesn't mean you lose anything, but you do stop accruing more future benefits). For that reason, I think the $2,000 a month feature probably needs some discounting. But, if Company Y asks for your target salary and you say something like $140k, I think you'd be pretty close.Keep in mind that many companies had great pension plans, but they are no longer there. I am not saying that your current pension will disappear - no, it will be there as long as company exists, but nothing says this pension plan will continue for the next 30 years. Its growth may be slowed down or stopped altogether at any point.I have no idea, but what’s your profession that pays 10k/ month in a pension?Can you envision working there untill retirement?A couple of things to consider - if your company kills their pension program (mine did this when I was only a few years into building it so I have a piddly little annuity instead of a sizable pension coming after 22 years).

74,Considering renting out my house and buying a new one.,"As the title states I am looking to rent the house we currently live in and buy a new one.  We are in our early 40s.  I bought this house in 2005 for $225000.  I owe $90k still on the loan and it is scheduled to be paid off in 2027ish. It's currently worth roughly $500000.  My payment is $1225/mo.  I refi'd to a 15 some years ago.  I've chatted with three propery management companies here in our metro area and all three say they'd rent it for ~$2500/mo.  I have no desire to manage the rental myself, so if I do this I am pretty sure I will go the property management route.

One idea is that I throw everything I have at the loan and pay it off.  Or I pay it down some then refi it to a 30 and knock that payment way down to like $300/mo and rent it out using property management.

The other idea is we sell it and buy a house about the same value and break even.

The last idea is we sell it, use all the equity and buy a bigger more expensive home.  But I am hesitant to be saddled with 30 years of mortgage payments that could quite likely outlive me at this point.  I assume by the time I retire I'd likely sell again and downgrade.  But who knows.

No use paying anything now since you're not being charged interest and could be earning interest in an HYSA.  Consider your interest rates as well though.  We've paid down our highest interest loans and rather than attack our 3.5% interest loans, we've been much better off investing that money.  Personally, I would invest rather than pay off loans <5%, but if the debt bothers you, go for it.  Also important that you keep some of that money stashed away for emergencies, especially with an older vehicle.

Be careful with that 403b.  Some of them are very limited on their investment options and I wouldn't recommend an annuity.  I'm a teacher and our 403b options are garbage.  If there's any sort of employer match it might be worth considering, but otherwise you're probably better off setting up a Roth/IRA through a brokerage.

The comments say things about CDs with rates of 2-3% from places like Discover and Ally.

When I go to check, e.g. [https://www.ally.com/bank/view-rates/](https://www.ally.com/bank/view-rates/) or [https://www.discover.com/online-banking/cd/](https://www.discover.com/online-banking/cd/) and I see rates more like 0.85% for 5-year CDs.

I remember going through this same thing about a year ago, and the year before that, and each time never finding anything over 1% (or am I misremembering??). So I just keep my small amount of extra money (\~10k that not in my IRA or emergency fund) in my 0.5% Ally savings.

We are looking for a 3 br 2 ba in a major Midwestern city. This would be a ~5 year home for us. Historically, this would be a $150-200k home in the areas we are looking. Right now, the market is bonkers. Prices are +20% compared to last year and anything in a desirable area is gone for cash in 4 hrs, above asking, and sometimes significantly over asking. 

Early on, we set ourselves a modest budget of $225k despite being approve for $400k. We don’t want to over extend and risk being house poor.  

Since looking, we have raised our ceiling to $275k, which makes me feel uneasy given the uncharted waters of the current market. I personally don’t see prices coming down from this point, but I am not comfortable spending $300k on a house that just 2 years ago would have been $200k. It just doesn’t seem sane to me. 

However, it seems like given the market exuberance, this is just the way it is if you want a house right now. You will have to pony up more than ever before, and you just have to hope that the market stays afloat.

If the prices are high (and rentals haven't gone up) - that may mean it makes more sense to rent, than to buy.  Only buy if you can sustain the spend (mortgage / expenses) AND if it works out better than renting.

No one can predict whether prices will stay where they are, go up even more, or drop; what you can ensure is your ability to weather whatever happens.If you’re estimating you’ll only be there for 5ish years then do the math on renting vs your anticipated house payment (mortgage+taxes+insurance+utilities).

Second homes and cottages are being snapped up as people realize they may not be flying for a while. Hope get a good price. Just don’t panic buy -

How much do you have in other retirement accounts? How much do you save a month currently? Do you have an e-fund? If you are 60 and have 6 million dollars in the bank I will tell you to take that money and go buy yourself a Porsche.  If you are 30 and have $25 in your 401k I'm going to tell you something very different.My wife and I paid our mortgage 25 years ahead of schedule and have had no money worries for 20 years. 

There is a lot you can do when you don't have that $2400 a month mortgage payment. 

* My wife did not need to work full time when we had kids. 
* I quite my job to pursue another career.
* We traveled.
* We put money away for college.
* We own the cars that we want to drive. 

You need to balance investment vs debt. There is only so much happiness in financial security when you hit your late 50's.>  It’s a super cheap mortgage @ 2.62%   
>  
> putting in the stock market (risky to calculate)? 

There's a very easy way to calculate the relative risk. It's the same thing as the return. The stock market will return, over a long period of time, an average of 7-10% per year.

That is, for you to invest your money even though there is a risk of loss, the market has to pay you back 7-10%. Your mortgage lender made the same calculation. In order to lend you $460k, they demand 2.62% back each year to compensate them for the risk of you being unable to pay them back.

But that answer is academic and probably doesn't help you all that much.

What you really need to consider is, how much volatility in the stock market can you absorb? The market will give you 7-10% on average, but depending on what you invest in, that really means that some years will be +3%, or -15%, or +21%, or -3%, or +8%, etc.

So a year from now, if you did invest a bunch of extra money instead of paying down your mortgage, and the value of your stocks dropped by as much as, say, -25%, would you panic and sell everything to stop the losses? Would you hold on, and wait for as long as it took to recover? Would you need the money for anything else in that time?

You said you have a fairly stable job. Is it the type of job/company that never does layoffs during recessions? 

&#x200B;

This is why, even though mathematically investing in the market will get you a better return on investment than paying down your mortgage, a lot of people still won't do it. Emotions can dictate your behavior. Employment circumstances can change. Costs of living change (kids incoming? Roof caves in? Gas prices go up?  Paying down your mortgage is a fairly guaranteed return (to retire your debt, that is) while stocks are volatile in the short-term.If it were me (not a financial advisor) I'd keep like $25k in a liquid savings for emergencies, and I'd put the rest 70/30 $VTI/BND. Unless you plan on using this $180k for something in the next ~10 years.The ""safe"" investment would be to pay down your mortgage. Trying to figure out what the stock market is going to do in 1-2 years is difficultWhats the purpose of this $180K?Everyone else is giving bad advice. Here is what you do.

You take that money and you dump it in a managed investment account and you don't touch it until you retire.

Talk to an investment advisor and an accountant.Buy an investment property that will cover your mortgage with the excess monthly cashflow.

Now you'll have 2 mortgages being paid off by your tenants of your investment property.

basically 7-8% year in, year out.  It'll beat your mortgage rate.  Its a win.

Though, once paying that thing off becomes doable, jump at it, its a life changer - early 40's here, own our house / cars out right - I owe no one, nothing...you recover cash fast monthly...Sounds like you already have money in stocks. Any interest in real estate? You can find an investment property to rent out near you. Or you can buy a vacation home within a few hours drive that you can also rent out on AirBnB.

If you do decide to put in stocks. Max out your 401K/457b/IRA first and use that money to supplement that extra coming out of your paycheck. I personally think stocks are going to come down significantly over the next year or two so don't put it into the stock market all at once, put in a specific amount every month.",1611681915.0

87,Double taxation from state of employment and home state,"I started a job last fall so it’s been entirely remote. I would have had to move to a different state if it was in person, but it won’t be for several months so I haven’t yet. I’ve been getting taxed for both my state of employment and the state where I live. When I asked the payroll department if this was avoidable, they said state taxes are based on both where you live and where you work so there’s no way around it unless I move. Is this really true? Shouldn’t I only be paying taxes for the state where I live?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5m3fj/double_taxation_from_state_of_employment_and_home/,"This really depends on the specific states involved. Generally, unless the two states have some sort of reciprocal tax agreement, you pay tax based on where you physically work, and also where you are a resident. Your resident state then gives you a credit for taxes paid to other states, so you aren't taxed twice on the same income. Generally you don't owe tax in the state where your employer is located if you don't physically work or live there. However, there are a small number of [exceptions](https://taxfoundation.org/remote-work-from-home-teleworking/).Depends on the states. 

As the other commented noted, there's a quite small chance that you will be truly double-taxed and owe full taxes to both. More likely, though, is that you will need to file a Resident return in the state where you live, to which you will report your out-of-state income. And you'll also need to file a non-resident return to the state that employs you.

But you probably need to file a tax return in both. That is, a Resident return in the state where you live, and a Non-Resident return in the state where your employer is. Your Resident state (where you live) should credit you for the taxes you paid to your Non-Resident state. If your resident state has a higher tax rate, though, you will still owe them the remainder. For example, say that;

* Make $50k a year
* You Live in New York, where your income tax bracket is 6%
* Your office is in New Jersey, where your income tax bracket is 5%

Ordinarily, you would;

* First file a non-resident return with NJ for the income you earned from that state. You will owe $2500 in taxes
* Then, file a resident return in NY. Your tax liability would be $3000, but you will receive a $2500 credit for the taxes you paid to NJ. You would still owe a net $500 to NY

Knowing this, you would set up your paycheck withholding (assuming bi-weekly) to be;

* NY: \~$20 per pay period
* NJ: \~$95 per pay period

&#x200B;

So if you're getting fully double-taxed right now on your paycheck, it could be because you haven't adjusted the withholding of your resident state to account for the tax credit you'll receive for payments to the non-resident stae.

&#x200B;

All that said, pre-covid telework rules, post-covid telework rules, out-of-state income taxation policy, reciprocal agreements, etc can make your case an exception. We can't tell you without knowing the states. And even then, you might be better served by visiting a CPA for a consultation or to help you prep your taxes the first time around.Entirely depends on states. Some have agreements with each other to where the employee only has to pay tax in the state they live in, not the state they work. (Wi and IL have this agreement)",1611690951.0

89,Opinion on taking a 401k Loan for Primary Residence,"Hello,

I want to take a loan of around $15K-$20K out of my 401K to help put money down on my first home purchase. Fidelity offers 12-180 month loans for primary residence and I would be paying 4.25% interest back to myself over the loan term. 

&#x200B;

All my 401K is currently a Roth 401K where I went ahead and paid the taxes on the money upfront. My job matches 50% of every dollar I put into the 401K up to the federal limit. I estimate that over the next 6-7 paychecks I could contribute around $9K-$10K then get an instantly vested match of $4.5K-$5K. 

Would it make sense to make those next 6-7 paycheck contributions pre-tax 401k as opposed to my current roth 401k option? That way I am technically contributing a bit more as the taxes aren't getting taken from it.

* MAFRX/Pioneer Multi-asset Ultra Short Income A.

Just going by the fund ratings neither of these seem like great picks. Our board treasurer picked them several years back. Obviously, the goal is fairly safe, conservative investments. Return doesn't have to be great but any little returns are important for the org.

This is our reserve account, so in theory, we could need to access the money. We'd see that need coming for about 3 months ahead of when it is needed.

91,Tax Dependency Status when living off a 529 account,"First, thank you all for being so great and helpful. This sub has helped me a lot in the last couple years, and I'm grateful to you guys.

On to the situation. My girlfriend is a senior in college (22 y.o.) and I'm trying to help her file her taxes for 2020. In all previous years, her parents have claimed her as a dependent, but I'm not sure if she should be considered a dependent. 

When she was young, her grandfather created a 529 account for her. When he passed, her parents acquired the account. She works part time, and is supported by her income and the money from the 529 (her parents pay only for her car insurance). My question is, is the money in a 529 account considered support provided by the student or support provided by account owner (parental)?

If she could file as an independent, her refund would be larger, and she would qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit, which would really help her out.  I've done some digging, and it sounds like everyone has a different opinion, and the IRS hasn't officially made any statement on it.

According to an email from an IRS  rep mentioned in this thread: [https://forum.savingforcollege.com/t/distributions-from-529-plans-and-parent-support/10834/6](https://forum.savingforcollege.com/t/distributions-from-529-plans-and-parent-support/10834/6).

96,Do sole proprietorships owe international taxes?,"Hello!

I have a complicated tax situation, which I am trying to figure out myself. I understand I may need to pay somebody to help me, but the options look quite expensive. 

I have many sources of self-employed income, from multiple international clients. I also moved internationally from USA -> Germany this year. 

I understand I have a tax obligation to the USA, and a tax Obligation to Germany. My current assumption is that money earned *before* my German visa is USA income, and money earned *after* is German income. 

Two main questions:

1) I understand US is one of the few countries that tax based on citizenship, not location. How do I avoid paying double taxes on my German earnings? I don't qualify for FEIE since I didn't live here long enough.

2) Is it possible I have a tax obligation to my foreign clients? None of them withheld any tax earnings for me. I have clients in: USA, Germany, Canada and Canada. After relocating, I have clients in only Netherlands. 

3) I also own an online business, which has monthly subscription. This subscription is being taken from members all across the whole world. I don't have good location records for all clients. Is there a tax obligation here, beyond just US/German?

I'm reading a lot, but these are the questions I am struggling to answer with my Google Fu. 

Thanks for reading!

EDIT: In particular, I am really curios about the online subscription I sold. I had around 20 clients (so not totally unmanageable to mark each by hand...). 

These clients were from all over the world though, and I don't have ""tax details"" from them. Like VAT, fullname, etc.

I'm getting nervous I owe taxes here, besides just US self-employed tax.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5ls82/do_sole_proprietorships_owe_international_taxes/,"This will depend to the tax treaty between the US and Germany. If you're going the DIY route, you need to find it and read it and understand it.

Also important will be understanding what it takes to establish tax residency (which can be different from immigration residence) in Germany. There may be paperwork involved on both the Germany and American sides. Do you still have an American house, bank account, investments? Do you have a German version of all those? For example, if you've kept your American house and are renting in Germany, the American system might consider you not to have emigrated tax-wise. 

Depending on the state you left (I'm looking at you, California, but there may be others), you may also owe tax there going forward as that will be considered your state of residence.

As for the Foreign Earned Income Exemption (FEIE), [the IRS has guidelines for partial years](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/figuring-the-foreign-earned-income-exclusion), so you may still be ably to apply it. Note that the FEIE only applied to ""earned income"" (basically wages) and so doesn't cover investment income like dividends or capital gains. Note as well that certain investments or investment accounts may be tax free in Germany but might not be for your American taxes.

As for you foreign clients, sales tax is usually what you have to worry about there. The question of whether you need to collect sales tax likely turns on the definition of ""nexus"" and where they deem the sale to have taken place (at the customer's address or yours?), which unfortunately will vary by location as well. Though you may qualify for de minis or exporting exemptions.

Good help is expensive (I would ballpark at US$1000 per hour), but getting it wrong can be very expensive too. I don't think you have a great option here besides becoming an expert in international tax law yourself.

As a side, from strictly a financial point of view, if you don't plan on returning to the US, the cheapest answer may be to renounce your US citizenship. That won't fix your problems from before that goes through, but it would likely solve them going forward....Your best source of free info are other US expatriates in Germany.

Your best source of reliable info would be accountants that specialize in expat taxes.

I would suggest diversifying some more, but vanguard has a ton of funds/etf's to choose fromWhen people say ""taxable account,"" they just mean a regular investment or brokerage account, as opposed to a tax-advantaged investment account like an IRA.

You already have an IRA that you've maxed, so you can't contribute anything further to a traditional or Roth IRA.

Since you already have an account with Vanguard, you may wish to open up another brokerage account for ""general investing"" at Vanguard. You're free to keep investing in VTI/VOO, or choose something else.The 2 main types of broakerage accounts are cash or margin, if you have the self control not to bet with borrowed money and are not day trading (just about everyone who does looses money) then a margin account might be a better option. The reason is that with taxable accounts you can use realized losses to offset other dividends, gains, and up to $3k regular income a year through ""tax loss harvesting"", the idea is if the market drops you can sell holdings and buy other stocks or ETFs that are substantialy different (read up on wash sale rules). I use a margin account and hold voo or vti and sell one and start buying the other when there's a drop, then use the extra space in the 12% federal bracket that creates to do more partial Roth conversions for cheap. If I had a cash account instead of a margin account, I would have to wait for the sale to settle before the money was available to get back in the market, which takes days and can cost a lot in missed recovery gains. As for voo and vti, they are substantialy different because one tracks total market, and the other tracks the sp500, but because they are capitalization weighted they behave similarly from a gains perspective and have a low dividend yield which helps with reducing tax drag. I'm no pro, so might not be the best plan, if anyone knows a better way please let me know.",1611699524.0
