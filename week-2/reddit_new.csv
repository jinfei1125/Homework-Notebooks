0,How come my sister is being told that the money put towards a car lease doesn't get applied to the cost if she decides to buy it?,"I'm not sure if there's a misunderstanding, but I was just in this situation myself. I leased a car and at the end of the lease, I decided to buy it. And all my monthly payments (along with the down payment) was deducted from the cost of the car. So if the original price was 20k, and I paid 10k over the course of the lease, if I wanted to buy it, I would pay another 10k (not including other taxes and fees). So I'm not sure what the salesmen is talking about. This is what he was saying:

1,Trying to determine taxable amount from investment account that was set up when I was a child,"When I was a child, my grandmother set up an account for me at a local stock brokerage. When I became an adult, I never really did anything with it, never even transferred it to an account exclusively in my name. I was just satisfied to let the money continue to grow.

Eventually, I found out that the account had been turned over to my state's unclaimed property division. So I went through the process to recover the stock, and I got it transferred into a Fidelity account, where I immediately sold it and reinvested in an index fund.

On the tax form that I received, it indicates that the cost or basis for that amount is unknown. I am at a loss as to what I might need to report on my taxes for that!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6g7pw/trying_to_determine_taxable_amount_from/,,1611786448.0,1

3,Wrong State Information on 1099-R from Traditional 401(k) to Roth IRA Rollover,"CONTEXT:
I live in Florida, but I'm visiting my parents/family long-term in Indiana during the pandemic. During my visit, I rolled over two traditional 401(k) accounts from former employers to a newly created Roth IRA.

The former administrators required that physical checks be sent to me and then I would send the checks to the administrator of the IRA. This is where the mistake was made. Instead of doing what I should have done (call the former administrators and ask them to mail the checks to Indiana but keep my Florida address on the checks), I changed my address to my parents' with the administrators and then the Indiana address ended up on the check.

I didn't think anything of it at the time. But I was recently issued my 1099-R's from these administrators and although my address on the form is in Florida, the local state distribution lists Indiana. I called the administrators to see if they could retroactively correct this, and they told me to talk to my tax professional.

I have no tax presence in Indiana and I will not be paying any Indiana taxes, but I'm sure this information was reported to them, and I want to make sure I handle this situation correctly so their tax department doesn't come knocking on my door. I typically file my taxes by myself to keep costs to a minimum. I tried to find a solution online but came up empty.

QUESTION:
Is this a matter worth consulting/paying a tax professional for, or does anyone out there have advice on how to correct this situation?

Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6g4oa/wrong_state_information_on_1099r_from_traditional/,It doesn't matter because no tax is withheld. The rollover-conversion is added as income to federal and your resident state.,1611786232.0,1

6,Confused on what how other income is calculated against Social Security in the year begin taking it and up to when I turn 66. Help?,"Thinking about taking early SS when I turn 62 mid year 2021.  

My wife and I own a business together, schedule C, we file separate schedule C's.  I also have been and anticipate receiving pandemic self employed unemployment in 2021.  I may also have a certain amount of side gig income in 2021.  Married filing jointly.

Can someone provide me some links to understand what kinds of income will affect my social security taxability or even reduce it on a dollar for dollar basis?

For example, if we put all our business income under my wife's schedule C (allowable), would my wife's income reduce my SS?

Will my unemployment reduce my SS?

Will my or our shared taxable investment income (typically qualified dividends, taxable interest, ordinary dividends, and capital gains)?

How about taxable withdrawals from my IRA?

This is very confusing to me and of course will affect whether or not to take SS early.  Aside from those questions, I've done the math and with my life expectancy it does make some sense to take SS early.

7,Short-Term Capital Tax conversion,"I have a question about Short-Term Capital Gains Tax on stocks.

I invest $1000, yield gains of $1000, and hold this stock for less than a year. In this situation I'd be subject to Short-Term Capital Gains. This would be counted as an income tax with a total gain of $1000.

If I were to never realize this now $2000, and invest it in a safe ETF which I hold for over a year, would I then be taxed at a Short-Term or Long-Term rate? Also would the taxes on this ""second"" trade be from the original $1000, or the $2000 invested?

The other driver's insurance is saying no (for whatever reason) and my insurance said I have to go through small claims court.   


I was recently told that the mother of the driver wants to pay for damages outside of court. But im not sure how risky this is or what steps to take?   


Anyone have advice on next steps?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6fswp/rear_ended_and_at_fault_party_wants_to_pay/,"Your situation is very strange, why would the other person insurance say no? could be because the son was not listed as a driver on his mothers policy(basically no coverage). Why is your carrier saying to go through small claims? Could be because the damage is less than your deductible either $500 or $1000 or you dont carry collision coverage on youre vehicle. I recommend taking youre vehicle to repair shop and get an estimate from 2 or 3 reputable shops and show the bill to the person that hit you and have them pay you the full amount.Go to 3 different places and get quotes on repairs, type up a contract that states the course of action being taken and how itll be handled(if itll get paid over time or paid in full) and get it notarized. This way you can offer the best choice, they see the options and costs and both are in agreement of the arrangement. If the contract gets broken, then you have even higher ground to stand on against them if it has to go to court. Though i dont understand how the insurance isnt doing its job for you in this matter, this may be the best approach to getting it handledGet a few quotes to have the damage fixed. Present the quotes to the mother. If the mother agrees she can give you cash to get your car fixed. If you do this get it in writing. Ask to be paid in cash so there is no chance the check doesn't clear. Once you have the money get your car fixed. Insurance does not need to be involved.Two options. 
1. File a claim through your insurance, you will have to pay your deductible but you should get it back when deemed not at fault. It won't make it to court if the police report is accurate to what you are saying. 

2. Go to a repair shop and get a repair estimate. Give it to the other party and they can pay you the amount in cash. They do not get to barter. They do not get to say X shop is cheaper than Y. They do not pay you in multiple payments. Whether you repair the car is entirely up to you. Having the repair done isn't required but you are entitled to the repair amount. You can print off a generic ""release of liability"" form from google and sign it. Accepting their payment will release them from any further demands. Its less risky for you than it is for them. I would 60% expect them to give you the run around when they see the repair estimate. At which point just file a claim with your insurance and let them deal with it.

Its really up to you. I would personally give them the chance. Some people just want accidents kept off their record and will pay. The others can't afford their deductible nor can they afford paying your repair cost.",1611785401.0,4
9,Is it better to trade in or refinance for a breed interest rate on an auto loan?,"So here’s what’s going on. Last March, my dad bought me a Toyota Corolla that after all of the dealer shit bullshit ended up being about $27,000.

Since the car is about a year old, we were looking at refinancing, but his credit score hasn’t improved much. I’ve since turned 18 and have established my own credit score of around 650.

Here’s my question, would it be better to attempt and refinance, or trade in the car for a new one at the same price (The value of the car is about $15,000) and have me co-sign with him so that we could get a lower interest rate and lower monthly payments while also taking on what’s still owed for the first car?

Rather than charging interest, they're going to charge you a fee. They're changing the fee to a monthly fee of 1.72% of the eligible purchase amount. So, if you don't sign up one of your purchases for it, there's nothing for you to worry about.We're making the following changes to your Cardmember Agreement as described below. We are updating the description of the My Chase PlanSM Fee, and making changes to these sections of the Cardmember Agreement: Amendments, Cash-like Transactions, My Chase PlanSM, and Interest-Free Period. All changes take effect 4/10/2021.

Details on the Changes to Your Account Effective 4/10/2021:

1. Your Cardmember Agreement Rates and Fees Table is amended as follows:
Revised Terms as of 4/10/2021
My Chase PlanSM Fee (fixed finance charge)	Monthly fee of 1.72% of the amount of each eligible purchase transaction or amount selected to create a My Chase Plan. The My Chase Plan Fee will be determined at the time each My Chase Plan is created and will remain the same until the My Chase Plan is paid in full.
Additional Information About These Changes

My Chase Plan Fee: The My Chase Plan Fee is calculated at the time each plan is created and is based on the amount of each purchase transaction or amount selected to create the plan, the number of billing periods you choose to pay the balance in full, and other factors. The monthly and aggregate dollar amount of your My Chase Plan Fee will be disclosed during the activation of each My Chase Plan.

2. Getting Started: Your Account

• ""Our Responsibility” for the Amendments section within the Getting Started: Your Account section of your Cardmember Agreement is amended to include a reference to delivery of amendments, as follows:

Our ability to make changes to this agreement is limited by applicable law. We may communicate amendments to this agreement to you via mail, email or other electronic means, or included in your monthly billing statements as permitted by law.

3. Important Definitions

• The ""Cash-like Transactions"" section within the Important Definitions section of your Cardmember Agreement is replaced to clarify and expand the definition as follows:

TERM	WHAT IT MEANS
Cash-like Transactions	Cash-like transactions will be treated as cash advances. Cash-like transactions include, but are not limited to, the following transactions to the extent they are accepted:

•	purchasing travelers checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers, cryptocurrency, other similar digital or virtual currency and other similar transactions;
•	purchasing lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers, and similar offline and online betting transactions;
•	person-to-person money transfers and account-funding transactions that transfer currency; and
•	making a payment using a third party service including bill payment transactions not made directly with the merchant or their service provider.
4. Using Your Card

• The introduction to the Using Your Card section of your Cardmember Agreement is amended as follows:

You can use your account in the following ways. Your account is to be used only for personal, family or household purposes. You cannot use your account for illegal purposes, such as writing checks against uncollected funds. You agree that we may rely on information provided to us by merchants and the applicable payment network to categorize transactions as Purchases, Balance Transfers or Cash Advances.

• The ""My Chase Plan"" section within the Using Your Card section of your Cardmember Agreement is updated as follows:

TRANSACTION	WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU	OUR RESPONSIBILITY
My Chase PlanSM	If eligible, you may use the My Chase Plan feature through Chase.com or the Chase Mobile App to create, from recent eligible purchase transactions or eligible amounts, a My Chase Plan balance with set repayment terms, subject to the My Chase Plan Fee. From the available offers, you select how many billing periods it will take to pay the My Chase Plan balance in full by making regular payments each monthly billing period. For each billing period during which there is a balance in the My Chase Plan, you will be charged the My Chase Plan Fee, rather than interest under the Purchase APR.

An eligible purchase transaction for My Chase Plan is a purchase of at least a specified dollar amount but may not include certain purchase transactions, such as cash-like transactions and any fee owed to us, including Annual Membership Fees. An eligible amount for My Chase Plan is a portion of your account balance, as specified from time to time within the My Chase Plan experience. Cash advance, balance transfer and My Chase Loan transactions are not eligible for My Chase Plan.

Your ability to create a My Chase Plan balance is based on a variety of factors, such as your creditworthiness, your credit limit, and your account behavior. You will not be able to create a My Chase Plan balance if you enroll in a debt management program or if your account is closed or in default.

When you have a My Chase Plan balance on your account, we will not charge you interest on new purchases if you pay your entire Interest Saving Balance by the due date each month.	At our discretion, we may make My Chase Plan available to you; we may decline a My Chase Plan transaction for any reason.
5. Paying Us Back

• The ""Interest-Free Period (also called Grace Period) on Purchases"" section within the Paying Us Back section of your Cardmember Agreement is amended to clarify the definition as follows:

IMPORTANT INFORMATION	WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU	OUR RESPONSIBILITY
Interest-Free Period (also called Grace Period) on Purchases	
•	When your account is in an interest-free period, interest is not charged on new purchases.
•	Your account is in an interest-free period when you have paid the New Balance or Interest Saving Balance shown on your most recent billing statement by the due date and time.
•	If you do not pay the New Balance or Interest Saving Balance shown on your most recent billing statement by the due date and time, you will lose your interest-free period and we will charge interest on your purchases.
•	You can regain the benefit of the interest-free period by paying your New Balance or Interest Saving Balance by the due date and time.
•	After you enter an interest-free period again, interest charges on purchases may still appear on your next billing statement. This reflects interest charged from the beginning of that billing cycle through the date that your payment for the prior billing statement was received.
•	Balance Transfers, Checks and Cash Advances do not have an interest-free period and if these balances are not paid in full by paying your New Balance or Interest Saving Balance by the due date and time, you will lose your interest-free period on new purchases.
•	When your account is in an interest-free period, we will not charge you interest on new purchases.
•	When your account is not in an interest-free period, we will charge you interest on your purchases from the date the purchases appear on your account until your New Balance or Interest Saving Balance is paid in full.
•	For more details about how we calculate your interest charges, see the Interest Charges section of this agreement.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/personalfinance) if you have any questions or concerns.*So federal income taxes on $70,000, with no deductions, adjustments, other income, or credits is $8,388, or $322.60 every 2 weeks. Although you're not actually paid every 2 weeks, so that's a potential issue.

So you need to tell us if you have any of those adjustments, and/or if you told any of these things to the IRS withholding calculator. Since withholding should be $322.60 the fact you had $903.98 withheld to date means you've had $264 withheld too much. So Step 3 should be $264 (well, 12/11ths of that number since one month is gone), and note with everything else blank (Sections 2 and 4 will be on that form the IRS had you download) then withholding will be perfect ($0 owed or due) assuming none of those things above.

So while I can't get exactly $406, the fact your paychecks are weird dates means there's no way I or the IRS can get you a perfect number, as the IRS algorithm only recognizes a few different pay frequencies (monthly, weekly, biweekly, semi-monthly, annually).

The good news is it's not far off. Although I'd just leave it blank, as I figure you'll owe $200+.",1611784190.0,1

18,"Parent gifting $15K a year, unsure about tax implications and how to best use it","My father is going to start giving me $15,000 a year as a annual gift. He said he's getting old, has a substantive estate, he'd like to share while he's still alive to see me enjoy it. Yes, I have an awesome father.

He says it's basically tax free, I've been trying to read up online about gift taxes, and it appears my state (NC) doesn't have an estate or a gift tax. Still I honestly can't believe the IRS doesn't want a cut of this money.

Either way I'm trying to figure out what to do with this gift, as I've never had that much on hand in my life, all my money is tied up in my retirement fund and my house. I had planned to replace my ancient car with a new SUV this year, financing about $35K. But now with this $15K gift I'm divided if I should use this money to reduce how much I finance on the new car or put the money into a bathroom renovation in my house. The bathroom works but it's dated and needs an overhaul, as I plan to start renting out that part of the house on AirBnB.

Thoughts and suggestions would be appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6faae/parent_gifting_15k_a_year_unsure_about_tax/,"Skip the bathroom reno altogether. Save $15k from this year's gift towards the car, wait until you get next year's $15k and then buy a $30k late model used SUV outright. Then you can thank your Dad profusely for keeping you out of debt/away from an auto loan. Then start investing any future gifts in a stock market index fund at Vanguard.Neither you nor he pay any taxes on this.

He probably picked 15k because that's a threshold for reporting. Above that amount per year, you still don't have to pay tax but you do have to add a form to your tax filing.

(Note that if he or you were married the amount is actually 30k. If you're both married it's 60k).

Financially, I would just follow the windfall guide:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall)AFAIK $15k is under the yearly gift tax limit.  No taxes involvedYou may find our [Taxes wiki](/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes) helpful.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/personalfinance) if you have any questions or concerns.*Yes, $15k is the amount you can gift someone each year and it doesn't count towards your lifetime tax exempt gift of I think ~ 12 million?? Not sure, but its super high.  So technically your father could give you up to ~12 million right now and it wouldn't be taxable.

And this money has already been taxed by the IRS.  Him giving it to you shouldn't result in them taxing it again.

Anyways, use the money towards some of your debt or something that would better your life.  

Also, your father isn't really limited to giving you $15k per year unless his estate is worth more than that ~12 million.  People with estates valued at more than that do the $15k thing since it's a way to minimize the estate tax on their holding above the 12 million mark.  If the estate is less than 12 million, it doesn't really matter other than it doesn't need to be reported to the IRS.",1611784103.0,2

Were you operating your business through a non-business account?If it really was 7k consistently i believe thats right below the threshold which triggers a reporting to the IRS (this is normal and isn’t a negative thing they are just required to do this with deposits & withdraws over/slightly under the threshold) if my memory serves me correct its 8k so it may have come across as if you were structuring deposits, which internally is a red flag. 

I may be wrong but just a heads up for future reference at any other bank you head to cause this is a practice all across the board.Was this a personal or business account?

Did they issue warnings about depositing the cash?

TL;DR - yes pay off as much cc as possible, starting with higher interest rate.

With the caveat that you might want to pay estimated tax to the IRS ~now-ish (can do it online), if you know your likely marginal tax rate for 2021.your best route is paying off $10K in credit card debt on the highest interest cards. it's that simple!take 30% and put it away for tax time.

Pay off Care Credit and Best Buy.   Then pick the one with the highest interest rate. Congrats on winning 10K!!! 

1. I would start an emergency fund with your money, preferably in a high yield savings account that's still accessible! Life happens, medical bills happen, car accidents happen, etc. Having that extra cushion will give you some peace of mind and prevent you from taking on more debt. Even if it's $500, $1000, etc, you'll be thankful for it down the road! 
2. You'll also want to start a Roth IRA if you don't already have one! With Roth IRA's, compound interest is EVERYTHING so every deposit you make will be well worth it in the future!
3. Pay off the card with the highest interest first! It's exciting to see your debt going down & it can inspire you to keep saving/doing what you're doing.
4. Invest in yourself. If there's a doctors visit that you've been putting off for a while, dental work that needs to get done, etc, get that done! This pandemic does a number on your health so it's more important than ever to make sure you're practicing self care, eating healthy, etc. For a personal example, I used some unemployment money to stock up on some supplements I've been eyeing ( [Moon Juice](https://moonjuice.com) & [Garden of Life](https://www.gardenoflife.com) are my two favorites) that were specially formulated for my chronic illness. I have more energy and less brain fog compared to my old vitamins so it was well worth it for me!Not a CPA. Figure out the taxes on it (maybe 30%) and put it in an online savings account so you don’t touch it. Next, attack your debts by interest rate. Once you pay down and have more available credit your score will increase. Just continue to not add to your debt and chip away at it.Save tax money pay off highest rates then see about getting debt consolidated at a bank or credit union at a lower interest rate.

28,Shady Chase Savings Account Practice,"I just wanted to relay my experience with a newly opened Chase Savings account.

At the end of December I opened a Chase Savings account as they had a $150 sign-up bonus promotion and interest rates have been so low I figured why not?  To receive the bonus you have to maintain a $10,000 minimum balance throughout the 90 day window to receive the bonus.  I transferred exactly $10,000 in, fees would be waived as long as $300 minimum was kept in the savings account and figured I would be golden to just let the money sit there for 3 months.

Today I checked my account and noticed the balance had dropped under $10,000 so I am no longer eligible for the sign-up bonus.  Why did it drop under $10,000?  Because when I opened the account my balance was $0 as my transfer into the account was still pending at that time and I was hit with a monthly fee since I did not maintain a minimum of $300 in the account.  

Obviously not the end of the world, but seems a bit ridiculous that I have to pay a monthly fee and that snowballed into me losing the bonus.

30,Estate planning-how to best set up to allow one heir to buy out the other and maintain the current home,"I have a significant disability and live in an extremely expensive part of the country so my partner and I have been sharing a property with my parents, who we pay rent to and assist with various things. The property was specifically left to my mom by her elderly, childless friend so my mom and I would always have a place to live. In the past my sister told my parents that she did not care about inheriting the house and I was not too worried because I thought I was going to be able to work full time, albeit taking a little longer to finish college than I had planned. 

Well of course life changes. My physical abilities declined, partially due to the lack of medical care when I transitioned from pediatrics to adult medicine. My partner had some health issues that impacted his career trajectory. My sister, who is much older than me and not very close emotionally to myself or my parents, has decided she does want a portion of the house and won’t work with me  so I can keep it when the time comes.  

Currently the house/property is part of a trust and I am the executor. I would inherit 75% of the property plus all contents (of course allowing my sister and nephew to choose sentimental items they want) and 50% of any life insurance money that is left (my parents have relatively small life insurance policies). The house has a $180,000 mortgage with a very good interest rate.  Stipulated in the trust is that I have 6 months to decide if I want to keep the home or sell it and am able to use the money in the bank account to make payments during that time. I am not counting on the life insurance being available for my sister or I as it may have to be cashed out to pay for my parent’s care as they get older (as far as I understand their policies have cash value that can be taken out). 

I would like to keep the property when my parents pass. I have a deep emotional attachment here and moving would disrupt my medical care and in home supports as well as my entire support system. I have already been told my sister does not intend to help with my parents’ care as they get older (that will be entirely on me and my partner and I can’t do much physically) and I already need to be available to help them with financial issues and healthcare. They would like to set up the trust so that my sister gets something but in a way that would realistically allow me to pay her off. They are afraid if they don’t leave her part of the house she would cut me off entirely from my nephew. Currently my income is only SSDI and my partner’s income, which is modest but will hopefully increase once he finishes his degree. We are unable to marry because I would lose my health insurance. We would have enough to pay the current mortgage payment and our living expenses but not a much extra. The property currently has a renter living in a trailer and I could use that money to pay my sister or pay a loan to pay my sister. 

I guess my questions are:is there a specific way to set this up so my sister does get a benefit but can’t force me out of the home if I can’t come up with her 25% (almost $200,000 right now)? If I inherit 75% of the house can she force me to sell to get her 25%? Could I choose to just send her a monthly payment towards her portion instead of getting a loan if I can not qualify/afford a loan? Could I refinance the current loan to also cover her 25%? I know that there are provisions to allow related heirs to assume the loan on a mortgaged property without meeting financial requirements. Who would I even talk to to get this information? 

My parents rely on me to get this sort of information and get very stressed/have a hard time understanding the info if they have to find it themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6es77/estate_planninghow_to_best_set_up_to_allow_one/,"You should be basically able to do that with a trust if it's set up right.

car2: 700 month toyota 4runner - 30K remaining, just hit 10K miles. (We had a paid off hyundai accent, but I hit a deer and totalled it, otherwise we weren't going to get another car until the honda was paid off)

insurance: 120/mo

petrol: 150-200/mo

HOA/sewer/garbage: 100/mo

gas/power:150/mo

Groceries: 500/mo feeding me/wife/one kid

medical: 200 (150 chiropractor, 50 to baby doctor) - these are upfront payments to keep balances at 0.

Fun: 500-1000 

Phone: 200 (2 ipad lines, 2 phone lines)

&#x200B;

Credit cards: (I know these are high, but we used them to get my wife through college, so it should pay off eventually) All CCs are within like 1-2 percent interest of each other

Amex: 20K balance - 600 payment, 300 goes to interest

Citi - 10K balance - 300 payment, 150 to interest

Local Credit Union - 10K balance - 300 payment, 150 interest

Adding all these up I get about 6000 outgoing and 7800 incoming. I am using about 1000 extra each month for getting credit card payments down (I was at 50K in cc's last July), and the remainder we use for things like christmas and vacations. 

&#x200B;

I know I could cut out the extra spending, and pay off credit cards faster, but is it really worth the morale hit to pay it off maybe 1 year earlier?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6eq6v/rate_my_updated_budget/,">car1: 600 month honda accord

>car2: 700 month toyota 4runner 

These are both outrageous based on your incomes.  

>Amex: 20K balance

>Citi - 10K balance 

>Local Credit Union - 10K balance

Buying an outrageous SUV when you're carrying **$40k in credit card debt** is even more insane.  

>I know I could cut out the extra spending, and pay off credit cards faster, but is it really worth the morale hit to pay it off maybe 1 year earlier?

yes, you had your fun, now its time to pay the piper unless you like paying 15-30% in interest.

>Credit cards: (I know these are high, but we used them to get my wife through college

Why in the world did you not use student loans?You should be cutting out vacations until you get your debt under control.  It is 100% worth it. You are paying tons of interest on those.

Your car payments are also ridiculously high.

Edit:

You would be doing yourself a  great favor to really break out that ""fun"" category.  Saying $500-1000 as a blanket statement shows you really aren't planning to track that all too closely and could get you in trouble there.Yes you should have your fun money down to 200 and the rest going to pay off CC debt. The interest rates are ridiculous on CC. 

Your car payments are way to much. $1300 a month for two cars plus the insurance and gas? I would try to see if it’s worth selling one, buy outright a used car 5-7 years old and pump that extra 600-700 into CC debt. 

Also, do yo have a EF? I don’t see any savings for an EF, home maintenance, kids education, etc. are you only saving via 401k? Think about building that into your budget also.

I don't see an ""internet / cable"" call out in your budget, not clear whether you're depending on phones - but you need to relook at that.You have a very nice income.  Unfortunately, you have some major debt that is holding your income back from being a wealth creation machine.  

I’d strongly recommend using a budgeting app (I’m a big fan of EveryDollar).

I didn’t see non-retirement savings mentioned.  *IF* you have any, take everything above $1k, and throw it at the debts, starting with the smallest and working up (pay minimums on the others that aren’t your focal point).

That Toyota is where you need to make a big decision.  In your shoes, I’d sell it, and go pay cash for a $10k car, to speed up being debt free.  If not, save it for last, but keep the tight budget/high rate of pay down.  

18-36 months to be debt free - besides the house - depending on your intensity, and how you handle the Toyota.People are going to be quite negative about your situation. You probably aren't worse off than the average American with $8k of take home a month. However the average American isn't financially responsible and literally lives walking a tight rope, constantly on the verge of falling off and risking financial ruin if there is a job interruption.


If you want your family to be taken care of, you need to run as fast as you can out of this situation. 


So... Each of you open a chase slate card for 0% balance transfer and move whatever you can to it them. Then aggressively pay down your credit card debt as much as possible.


It's frankly insane to have a 6k to 12k a year fun budget while having 30k-40k of high interest cc debt.


For the future, please understand that you don't need (and can't afford) 2 new cars. You currently pay a 2nd mortgage with your two car payments.

Sounds like you've done what you can on your end to freeze your credit.   Now you need to get in the habit of monitoring it.  

>How long should I keep fraud alerts for my accounts once I unfreeze them?

No reason to unfreeze them unless you plan on applying for credit.   You would want to freeze them again after getting approved for whatever credit / loan you're looking for.   

>How long will this affect me, and will I have to live the rest of my life worried that someone is waiting to use my SSN?

As the other commenter mentions pretty much everyone's SSN # has been compromised.  I wouldn't go through life worried, but make the necessary steps to protect yourself.  Try to do better about protecting yourself against scams and phishing attempts.  

>What else should I look out for moving forward (financing a car, opening an account, buying a house, etc)?

Same as everyone else.   We all need to monitor our credit, and assume our SSN is out there.  If you see something suspicious pop up on your credit report deal you'll just have to deal with it.Pretty much everyone's SSN has been compromised. Just be aware and check Credit Karma.You may already know this, but a fraud alert is NOT a credit freeze.  You want to **freeze** your credit.

If you have funds to cover a small home renovation, of around $5,000, is it better to pay for the renovation upfront or take a loan to cover the renovation and invest the funds instead?

My spouse's opinion is that they can invest our savings and get a higher return on their investment than the amount of interest we'd have to pay for the loan. My opinion is that any investment comes with some risk, we already have some debt in the form of our mortgage, and I don't want to take on more financial risk. 

Have you been in a similar situation? What's the wisest strategy here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6e2gx/taking_out_a_small_loan_to_fund_home_renovations/,"The returns from a short term investment on a principal as small as $5k will be very small. Not to mention, there is some inherent risk involved with any investment. 

Further, taking on debt to finance something like a non-essential home renovation is also risky, because you are taking on debt and many times you will not see a return on that money spent, especially if you don’t plan on selling anytime soon.

Overall, mathematically, yes, you could theoretically earn money on the spread if you earn a higher rate of return than what you borrow at. However, over such a short time span and in the real world with risk, you are MUCH better off cash flowing your renovations. Remember, investments are not guaranteed money, but you are guaranteed to have to pay back that debt.Assuming the renovation is non-critical and it doesn't provide an instant return on investment such as you selling a home for a great profit than the renovation, I generally recommend saving up for it and then spending the money.You're essentially asking if you should borrow money to invest in the stock market. You should not do that.What interest rate are you being offered on the loan?  I'm guessing high enough that the difference you'd earn investing the money instead is probably outweighed by the risk you're taking.Investing in the market is for the long term. The statistics of how much you'll earn in the stock market over time is based on a very long time frame. If you have the cash just pay for the reno. It'll be done and you won't have a loan.

If you aren't already familiar with investing and have a clear plan for what you would invest in, don't take the risk when you have the cash.Assuming the renovation is non-critical and it doesn't provide an instant return on investment such as you selling a home for a great profit than the renovation, I generally recommend saving up for it and then spending the money.If you don't feel you have the financial cushion to afford the risk, and you have a path that comes without risk, why would you take a risk?All depends, if you can get the loan at something < 5% than it may make sense to take the loan, otherwise just pay for it.",1611780567.0,2

If you sell a stock for a profit, but don't withdraw the gains from your brokerage account, do you still owe taxes on it? Can gains  be reinvested without being taxed, or are you taxed on all gains regardless of if you withdraw them from your brokerage account?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6duhw/beginner_question_on_capital_gains_taxes/,"> If you sell a stock for a profit, but don't withdraw the gains from your brokerage account, do you still owe taxes on it?

Yes

> Can gains be reinvested without being taxed

No

> are you taxed on all gains regardless of if you withdraw them from your brokerage account?

Yes.

The second your sell order executes, you owe taxes on the gains. The IRS doesn't care what you do with the proceeds after that.The sale is a taxable event whether or not you withdraw, reinvest, or do anything else with the money.yes, no, yes.

When you sell an asset for more than you purchased it for you will have capital gains.  If you held that asset for less than a year the capital gains are considered short term and will be taxed at your normal rate (ie it's just added to your normal income as if you earned it from your job).  If you held the asset for longer than a year it is considered long term capital gains and is taxed at a preferential rate (it still counts as income, but is taxed at a lower rate than money earned from your job).

Both short and long term capital gains count as income in the year you made the sale, and will have to be reconciled when you complete your taxes for the year.  So if you sold an asset today and had capital gains, it will be reported for this year (2021) and you will have to include it as income when you complete your 2021 tax return in early 2022.  

It doesn't matter what you do with the capital gains after the sale, you still count it as income.  You can withdraw it, leave it in the brokerage, or reinvest it into another asset.  It doesn't matter, whatever the amount of the gain was will be recorded and reported as income.Only way to not pay tax on a gain is to have an offsetting loss. This is call Tax Loss Harvesting.

During the 3.5 months of overlap at the start of each year, you can designate your contribution for either the prior or current year. It’s always a good idea to max out the earliest possible year available to you, since once that opportunity is gone, it’s gone forever. If you accidentally contributed for the wrong year, you may be able to ask your IRA provider to switch it to the other year.

If you think you might exceed the income limit for 2021, you should consider the [backdoor Roth IRA method](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/backdoor-roth-ira-tutorial/) as an alternative to direct contributions.Keep contributing to 2020 until you hit the max, or April 15 passes.

52,"Reasonable COL, High Quality of Life for Relocation?","Hi there. My husband and I are both in school, he is working as an apprentice electrician and going for his journeyman. I have been doing my pre-reqs for nursing school and just applied! I will find out if I was accepted in February. We are going back to school at 29 and 30 to increase our earning potential after many years of restaurant and tourism work (and lots of traveling and fun too!)

We live in a high cost of living town: Moab, Utah. The wages are not very competitive and the median home price is in the $400,000s. I feel very discouraged seeing prices like that...granted we are hoping to see our incomes increase as we move along but I feel like prices like that will lock us into the rat-race for eternity!! We have also been here for a few years and I feel like there is a whole wide world out there we can still see and I don't want to get ""trapped"" here.

We are super active--we love biking, hiking, surfing, long boarding, snowboarding...basically anything outside and active we enjoy! We have really been missing the ocean, and would love to try and find a spot by the ocean in the future. If not by the ocean, we want quick and easy access to biking and hiking trails. We are bike commuters and ride our bikes to work, to the store, and to friends houses. We love to not have to drive a ton; I grew up in suburbia and do NOT miss that.

Something else that is important to us is diversity, specifically the Spanish language. My husband is an immigrant from South America and we don't have a whole lot of diversity down here in Southern Utah. We would love to find an area where there is more Spanish spoken; I think it would help my husband a lot with his homesickness.

We still have a few years before we finish our degrees, but I need to find some hopefulness right now in thinking about future possibilities. Sometimes I just get too disheartened here about ever being able to buy a home. I would love any thoughts/suggestions/recommendations for cool places we could move to in the future!

53,Late 20s and In Serious Need of Financial Advice,"I am a 26 year old single male in serious financial strife. Years of utter financial illiteracy and ill-informed decisions I have made have me deep in a hole. I am at a total loss as to how to even begin getting myself out.

Coming from an impoverished family, I was determined to not continue this generational poverty, so I attended a four-year university and attained my degree. This was entirely self-funded, and working relentlessly while continuing my education elongated my time at the university more than anticipated. I graduated at 24. Immediately following college, I found that potential employers were reluctant (to say the least) to even grant me interviews without professional work experience or a Master's degree. I was stuck as a supervisor at my mediocre college job for eight months following graduation. I finally was hired on with a reputable company earning livable pay in early 2020. However, that only lasted five months before the consequences of the pandemic resulted in my lay off. I was unemployed for a month and a half before I had no choice but to return to my small hometown to accept a typically low-paying, unstable job in the restaurant industry. I'm now lucky if I gross $1,200 a month. With sparse job opportunity in my surrounding area, I have had no choice but to live a nomadic couch surfing lifestyle for months, which is obviously quite humiliating. I would love to relocate in search of an area with more opportunity for me to thrive, but my financial reserves have run dry and I have no resources to draw upon (or even a cosigner) to aid me if I even find an affordable place to live.

My financial details:

\-Amassed nearly $28K in student loan debt attaining my degree.

\-Currently owe $14k on a car loan ( ≈ $400/month)

\-Approx. $5,000 in credit card debt (now in collections)

\-Approx. $1,600 in medical debt (also now in collections)

\-Credit score fallen to about 480

&#x200B;

Going into college, I felt immensely confident that I had a bright future. My credit score was damn near perfect and my ambitions were serving me well. In just a few years, it feels as though all is now in shambles. With this towering deficit attached to my name and my reliably low earnings, I am exhausted attempting to survive financially day to day. Needless to say I have not had the opportunity to plan for emergencies or even find an affordable health insurance plan. Any advice is welcome as I am willing to do whatever is needed to get my finances on track and move toward a more hopeful future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6dkid/late_20s_and_in_serious_need_of_financial_advice/,"First thing i'll say is this. It feels like you're in a hole so deep that you can't get out of it. This simply isn't true. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. My first question would be this, are you upside down in the car? If not, the first thing i'd do is sell it and get the cheapest reliable car you can (or go without a car at all if possible this would help out immensely. with no car payment you could pay your medical debt in 4 months)
. Take whatever the difference in payment (if any payment left at all) and put that towards your other debts. If you truly want to eliminate this debt, you simply must make more money. Get a 2nd job. No matter how unappealing. This has two benefits. Firstly you bring in more money. Second, psychologically it will empower you. It will also have the benefit of making you money while not being able to spend money by keeping you busy.

It should be pretty simple to set up an income based repayment plan on your student loan (granted I've never had private student loans so if yours are private someone else might be able to help you). If you are able this should make your monthly payment pretty reasonable given your current income. 

Seeing as how your other debts are currently in collections paying one off before the other wouldn't have much of a benefit. Others might recommend differently but I'd pay off the smallest one first (interest isn't a factor in these debts anymore). Then I'd pay off the next largest.

At the end of the day the amount of debt you have isn't particularly large. It feels large, but much of it is quite manageable. I'm sure others have different ideas, but as someone who has been in a similar situation the psychological bump you get from taking chunks off, no matter how small, is huge.

Edit: I know none of this addresses your housing situation and I wish I had better advice in this area but I don't. Short of moving in with your parents (which isn't always an option) look to see if someone in your town is renting a room for cheap. I did this while in school for a while. It wasn't a horrible situation, but it was financially viable.

Edit 2: Thinking about your housing situation AND your financial situation. There is an industry that makes you more money AND addresses your housing issues. Long haul truck driving. At the bare minimum you'd at least double your monthly income to start and you live in the truck except on your days off (which, probably you could stay in if you wanted anyway). Extra bonus on top of this, many of the larger outfits will pay for and even train you to get your CDL. Is it glamorous? No. But, who cares. Having a CDL opens up huge opportunities. I've had mine for 15 years and has opened up many opportunities that aren't necessarily in truck driving. Being able to see the country can be cathartic. It reminds you that the world is big and your problems are small in comparison. In my area you can get a home every night driving job that starts at $25/hr plus benefits with NO experience just need to graduate the school (or obviously having long haul experience would suffice as well). Just a thought, but I'd honestly at least consider it. Kills a few birds with one stone.Did you not apply for unemployment after getting laid off? You should be getting fairly generous UI if you were laid off due to the pandemic. 

And what state do you live in? You should qualify for Medicaid and shouldn't have to shop around for a cheaper insurance plan. I know this isn't the case in deep red states that opposed Medicare expansion, but you should definitely look into it.

You probably also qualify for foodstamps, so look into applying for that too.

I understand that it might hurt your pride to use these programs if you grew up in poverty and are trying to escape, but these programs should ideally provide a safety net to help stabilize you to get back on your feet. If you were born to wealthy parents, they'd almost definitely be helping you right now.

60,Newbie Alert - Need help understanding retirement options ( 401k vs Roth 401k vs IRA),"Hi personalfinance community! I learned a lot by reading some of the archived posts and the general wiki but wanted to create a post to discuss my questions. I am finally at a stage where we are able to contribute to retirement savings and my brokerage account but need some advice.   


Both my husband and I are on a work visa and in constant limbo - we never know the outcome of our visa renewal until it actually happens so there might come a time when we have to pack up and leave. With that being said, my company offers a flat 6% 401k contribution without me having to do anything on my behalf. We now have a few thousand dollars that we are able to put away each month so should this go into a retirement account or do we invest in mutual funds? I am trying to get my head around all the different options but honestly cant figure out if we should put the money in my 401K or a Roth 401k or an IRA and how much of it should go into investing in a brokerage account. We do not qualify for a ROTH IRA so that is not an option, unfortunately. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6d3u9/newbie_alert_need_help_understanding_retirement/,"401k is an employer sponsored retirement plan  
IRA is an individually managed retirement plan  
Roth in front of either determines whether the money is pre/post taxes.

e.g. Roth IRA is funded with money you already paid taxes on, traditional IRA is funded with money prior to you paying taxes on it.

That matters when it comes time to withdraw it. traditional accounts you have to pay income tax on withdrawal as if you newly earned the money in the year of withdrawal. Roth accounts you can withdraw tax free (since you already paid taxes on it).

Traditional 401k has a higher limit of ~19k/year, but you can't withdraw contributions without penalties, though you can take a loan from the account without penalties subject to some restrictions.

These differ from a standard investment account like so:

Standard investment account = pay in using post-income tax money, when you sell investments at the end, you pay capital gains tax on the difference between your initial investment and the final selling price.

ROTH IRA = pay in using post-income tax money, when you sell investments at the end, you pay no taxes on the difference between your initial investment and the final selling price.

Traditional IRA = pay in using pre-income tax money, when you sell investments at the end, you pay income taxes on whatever you withdraw.

---

Generally the advice is to max out the traditional 401k, since it reduces your tax burden now, making it easier to save. Putting 10k into a 401k in this way effectively only costs you 7k right now, since you are avoiding paying taxes on it right now. You are likely to be earning less in retirement, so you will pay less taxes then than you would now.The general advice around IRAs and 401ks (and Roth vs. Traditional) assume that you'll be in the US during the time you're contributing and the time you're withdrawing.  So same general tax law apply to you during both, and there are guidelines around which is ""better"", typically by comparing your expected tax rates.

Your situation adds the possibility that at some point you *won't* be in the US, so then you'd have to find out how that impacts your ability to keep the account, access the balance in the account (either in retirement or sooner), taxes on withdrawals (maybe owed to both the US and your home country), etc.

I got curious and googled around a bit. Found a couple of pages that might help your research around options on any retirement account balances if you end up having to leave the US:

62,How to contribute,"So currently I am contributing to a 401k at my company with dollar for dollar match up to 5%. Pre-covid they were matching 10%, but due to profit loss and the whole deal they dropped the match down to 5%. I have since dropped my contribution to 5% as well, and was seeking guidance on this following:

My company offers a Roth401k option, and I have a Roth IRA opened via fidelity (all our 401k contributions are handled via fidelity) but I don't know if I should contribute the extra 5% I was contributing (to total a 10% per pay to either the 401k, roth401k, or Roth IRA). I suppose what I'm asking is: should I contribute the full 10% I was originally contributing to my traditional 401k like I always have been, or keep my contribution down at 5% and an additional 5% of my pay to a Roth IRA or additional 5% to a Roth401k. I'm a noob and don't know much about this so any help is appreciated. 

Specifics: I'm 28, have nothing in my Roth IRA that I have opened recently with fidelity, but roughly 60k in my 401k with about 50k vested balance.

Just realize that if you contribute to a Roth 401k, the match is always in a Trad 401k account (or at least that's how mine is, and I guess I assume that's how most everyone's is.

64,401(k) + Roth IRA vs. Roth401(k),"Hey everyone, 

I (21/m) just started my first full-time job. I am deciding which path to choose, having either: 401(k) + RothIRA vs. solely a Roth401(k). I finished ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich"" by Ramit Sethi and just came across some information in ""Money Master the Game"" by Tony Robbins. 

My initial thought was to contribute to my 401(k) to the point that my employer would match the contribution + x% (free money). I also planned on maxing out my RothIRA annually ($6,000 annual contribution limit). I prefer a Roth because I fully expect my taxes to increase as I progress in my professional career. 

I just came across the information that within a Roth401(k) the annual contribution limit is $19,500 --> I assumed it would be the same limit as a RothIRA but I stand corrected. I am aware that the employer match would be added tax free and that I would have to pay taxes on the employer match at withdrawal, but the significantly increased annual contribution has me leaning towards solely investing into a Roth401(k) despite the lack of funds I would have at my availability to invest in. As I previously stated, I prefer the Roth due to the tax-free withdrawal even though I am sacrificing potential gains that are sacrificed by investing tax-free money in a typical 401(k). I feel like contributing in solely a Roth401(k) would simplify my retirement accounts and make the process more seamless and simplified. Am I missing something here? 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Found out Roth401(k) has an annual contribution limit of $19,500 vs. Roth IRA is $6,000 --> So now am determining if I should invest solely into a Roth401(k) to simplify stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6cxi2/401k_roth_ira_vs_roth401k/,"Going the rIRA route typically opens you up to individual stocks/bonds/lower cost funds/etc vs only 'in company' funds which is appealing and your fee structure isn't tied to an employer so likely at some point in time you'll be moving this money or dealing with fees for non-contributing accounts.  Also you get some advantages to the rIRA vs the r401k. There's no required minimum distribution for an rIRA,   you can use earnings without penalty for a first time home purchase, and with an rIRA you can withdraw basis dollars at any time penalty free.  

It's 2021. 'Simplification' is dead when it takes 5 minutes to open an account online and never need to mail, write a check, or meet with a human.  Also unless you stay at 1 employer forever you're gonna roll this money to an IRA eventually.

TL'DR; get your 401k match, then prioritize rIRA max, then go back and fund your r401k to gain flexibility, reduce costs, and avoid RMDs in retirement.[Personal Finance Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Check out the link for the order of operations in how to get started. Once you have the basics down....

1. 401(k) up to employer match 
2. Max out rothIRA
3. Then go back and add additional funds into the 401k. 

You can invest in both. It is good to have a mix of pretax and post tax investments. That is ultimately your decision on what you think your future taxes will be like. 

If you have your own health insurance also look into an HDHP with an HSA. The HSA is triple tax advantaged. Pretax contributions, grows tax free and withdrawn (for health expenses) tax free.> I feel like contributing in solely a Roth401(k) would simplify my retirement accounts and make the process more seamless and simplified. 

It would but it's not that hard to have 2 or 3 accounts and a lot of places that offer Roth IRAs have a lot of other investment products that you'll probably want. Usually your employer 401k is with whatever their preferred institution is and unless you're lucky, the one you'd want your Roth IRA in is different. It might be worth it to manage the two accounts if you have a better choice of funds outside of your Roth401k. 

Of course, definitely take full advantage of the employer match. Once you're vested you *might* be able to roll it over to your preferred institution anyway.",1611777544.0,2

What can I do about that?,"I have this apparent medical debt that went to collections back in 2019. It's for a bill I paid in full to a hospital, but they are saying it could be the physician's bill. However, I was never sent a bill for that, and didn't even know such a thing existed until it popped up in collections and I called about it. I even called the hospital the first time it showed up and they said the company isn't their collections people, so it could be a scam -- hence I never went further with it.

I've been reporting it to the credit bureaus whenever it pops up and they eventually remove it, but then it just pops up again under a different company a few months later. So I'm curious if there's a more permanent way to deal with it.

I just called the most recent company and asked them to send me verification, which they said will take 6 weeks (to send a letter 2 states...)

The main problem is that whenever it pops up in the credit bureau sites, the ""Opened"" date is about 2 months prior. It doesn't show the original date which would be almost 3 years ago by now, so there are a few things I'm curious about:

1. Does this new ""Opened"" date count as if the start of the collections was on that date? I got the notification letter on Jan. 22, it's postmarked for Jan. 5th, but my credit report says the account was opened on Dec. 3rd. 2020.

75,First year into working real job - will I ever be able to buy a house?,"Hi,

I am a 32yo teacher in Germany and started my full time teaching position about a year ago (i took a long time studying).

I always had the goal of owning a house one day so I started a special down payment program with my bank where I get a very low interest rate if I save up at least 30% of the total house cost.

I currently have a net income of 3300€/month and after a year of employment I am not sure anymore if I'll actually be able to afford a house in my lifetime without sacrificing everything else. Here is a breakdown of the situation and I'd be thankful for advice:

|net income|3300€|will go up very slowly|
|:-|:-|:-|
|rent|750€|will go down in 1 year|
|down-payment plan|500€||
|savings|300€|currently at 4k, goal is 10k|
|investing|200€|ETFs|
|utilities|150€||
|insurance |350€|necessary medical|
|subscriptions / phone / etc|100€||
|transportation|200€|car insurance, gas, bike repair, ...|
|food|250€||
|work / self improvment curses|250€||

So currently I have around 250€ left every month for entertainement, cloth etc. My job is very stressful for me so there is absolutely no chance of getting a second job ontop (I'm working around 60-70 hours / week including everything). With my position there is a pension of around 70% of my final income, so I'm not worrying about having money for retirement.

My rent / utilities is a bit high because I'm living in an appartement big enough to house me and my girlfriend who is still studing to become a teacher. In about 1 year she is going to live with me again so my rent / utilites will go down substantially by then (hopefully).

When I looked on the market I did not find any houses for less than 250k€, typically it would be more like 300k€. I currently have 18k in the down payment plan, 4k in savings and 3k in investments. So if my calculations are right I'd need at least 75k in my down payment plan, which would take around 10 years at my current savings rate. But if the housing market stays on its upward trajectory houses will be more like 350-400k (they were 200k 5 years ago).

When I got into this job I was under the impression that I had a pretty good paying profession since I'm paid a lot more than most of my friends. Is my spending too high?

But how would the guy actually get paid with this type of investment? It doesn’t provide dividends, yet so many financial advisors recommend it as if you can rely on a consistent profit each month of, let’s say, 12%. What am I missing?

TIA",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6cam0/what_do_advisors_mean_by_living_off_of_mutual/,"The actual idea is that you build up some invested money, then gradually sell it off, letting asset growth offset the amount you're pulling out so that you don't run out of money. It's a perfectly sound idea.

However, that 12% number is garbage. It's higher than you can historically expect from stock investments, and it's definitely not a safe amount to withdraw if you need your money to last. A commonly accepted value for withdrawal rate is 4% of the initial principal (allowing for future inflation).

So DR is telling you the general truth but exaggerating it. My guess is that if you actually went deeper into DR's materials you would get more realistic info, and that the 12% is just an attention-grabbing headline.> But how would the guy actually get paid with this type of investment?

You sell some of it as you need money.12% is wildly high, long term the market historically yields 7%ish per year. So $100 in stocks today, on average, will be worth $107 a year from now. The idea is that you sell 4% a year - so you sell ~$4 worth of those stocks every year and live off the money. In that case, next year those stocks would be worth then $103 ($107-4). The next year you'd sell $4.16 worth of stocks and your account would now be worth $106.09. 


So it's just saying, have a lot of money in the stock market and sell some of those stocks every year. The total value should increase along with inflation, so you never deplete that nest egg.>It doesn’t provide dividends, 

Mutual funds absolutely provide dividends. In retirement you would live off a combination of dividends/coupon payments and withdrawals from principal. 

With a conservative enough withdrawal rate (4% is a baseline) you can rely on long term appreciation to outpace your withdrawals

12% isn't your withdrawal rate, its the accumulation rate, and 12% is on the high side, its probably closer to 7% after factoring inflation and of course its not guaranteed in any way.",1611775522.0,0

79,Moving to Israel from Europe - what online brokerages make sense?,"I am moving from Germany to Israel this year and need to figure out what I want to do with the +30k Euros/36k $ sitting in my savings account.

I want to buy some low-cost ETF savings plans, like MSCI World to invest about 1k monthly. Nothing exciting, just diverse, low-maintenance and low risk. I don't care about speculating, forex, bitcoin etc. I just want something stable for retirement.

**Here's my problem:**

From what I have read, it would cost an arm and a leg to open up an account with an Israeli brokerage. On the other hand, an EU brokerage might have cheaper savings plans BUT I would incur conversion fees (from NIS to Euro) as well as bank transfer fees every month when I buy with an Israeli reference account.

**What should I do?**

For starters, just open an EU brokerage account now + keep my German savings account as a reference account + just keep investing from that account till it's all gone (emergency fund is separate of this)? Once I start a job in Israel how should I keep buying?

Or right away go with something like Interactive Brokers and transfer all my savings into an Israeli reference account (where I might also lose 200 Euro for the initial bank transfer)?

80,"How can I make use of my investments and withdraw/borrow, in case of emergency.","I am expected to close on a home purchase next month, using virtually all of my savings and a small 401k loan to cover down + closing costs.

For my next few paychecks prior to closing, I plan to significantly decrease my ESPP to bare minimum so its still actively enrolled and decrease my 401k contributions to the pre-tax minimum that takes advantage of the company match. This is so I can rebuild my savings as well as have some money to quickly payoff the 401k loan, which should give me about a $5k safety net by close of escrow.

**If I encounter a situation where I need money for any scenario (repairs, emergency, debt payments). I'd like to what I can do with these investments:**

* Former employer 401ks - $170k (75% in pre-tax / 25% in roth)
* Current employer 401k - $35k (but 15k loaned out per above)
* Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) - $30k 

Some options that I understood in this subreddit or from various friends:

1. Rollover those former 401ks to a Trad IRA and a ROTH IRA, then withdraw from ROTH IRA if I have to since I already paid tax.
2. Do same as 1, but also rollover some amount to the current 401k in case a 2nd loan is needed (our policy allows two active loans, from funds that are 50% vested). Since I'm at 50% now with the first loan, rolling over more into the current 401k will give me some buffer.
3. Sell the stocks from the ESPP ($30k non-tradeable). I have $20k that meets the holding period by June this year, and $10k June next year.

Another thing is that my parents have offered me about $20k as a gift for down + closing, but they are just barely a year into retirement and I said to hold on to their money until end of year so they can see how their situation plays out. If they are fine, gift me by 2022 which I'll use to pay off the 401k loan and keep the rest in safety net.

81,"Is it better to transfer cc debt to new cc, or take out a loan?","So about 4-5 years ago i opened one of those Capital One 'starter' credit cards to establish credit. I have done well with that along with paying my car payments and have decent credit. Over time though, despite paying my minimums, or full monthly payments, it has accumulated interest charges which is so high (30+%) that I am basically doubling my monthly payment just to break even for each month. It isn't a huge debt, only 1900.

I am ready to navigate this differently and either get a personal loan to pay it off, or transfer the debt to a more deserving/reasonable credit card with a long term 0% balance transfer APR and lower general APR rate. What is my best option that will benefit me to most ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6c6jc/is_it_better_to_transfer_cc_debt_to_new_cc_or/,"The option that would benefit you the most is to pay off the balance.

Why are you carrying $1900 around for so long?You don't need a 0% balance transfer or a personal loan. It's a relatively small balance, as you said, knock that out in a few months or less by 1) budgeting and cutting back on expenses.

>despite paying my minimums 

If you ever find yourself in a situation in which you are opting to only make a minimum payment, you need to use the CC less.The most important step here is to make the necessary changes to your budget and your mindset so that you stop using this card until the interest-accruing balance is cleared.  If you don't, then transferring this debt is likely only going to make things worse.

Mathematically speaking, the ""best"" options are, in order of savings:

1. Paying off the balance within one or two months
2. Transferring the balance to a 0% promo APR card and paying it off before the 0% rate expires
3. Personal loan/paying off the balance more slowly/another CC

However, transferring the balance comes with the added danger that you could very well run up the balance on both cards afterward.  So it's **really** important that you fix this issue before trying to transfer balances, because this is how debt spirals start.

If you can't get a 0% APR card, a personal loan with a lower rate \*might\* be a better deal, but it really depends on your budget and the offers you get.  The minor advantage of a personal loan over another CC is that you can't dig yourself further into debt by spending what you pay off on the loan, but that risk of spiraling is still there with your current card.Your solution would work if you actually stick to it. I think everyone is more concerned with your “self-discipline”. They don’t want you to open a new CC, which increases your total spending limit, only to run up both cards and put you back in the situation you are currently in, but with more debt.",1611775144.0,0

Got rid of all my high limit credit cards (AMEX, MBNA, Barclaycard & an old Marbles card) around a year ago after gambling issues caused me to rack up a lot of debt on them.  2 missed payments around 9 months ago on ccs and higher than average number of credit (mainly high interest loans) taken out / repaid over the past few years but other than that everything else is ok.  High risk tolerance.

**Income**

£43250 pre tax per year (£2650 per month after tax) + a chunky bonus received at the end of March.  Amount TBC for this year but expecting around 35% (\~£15k) of annual salary.  Pension is company 15% me 4%, invested in high risk plan.

Also do freelance work for £50 per hour.  I'm aiming for 80 - 100 hours freelance a month at the moment given there is nothing else to do and I need to get myself back on track.  Assume the lower end of this, so £4000 / month.

2650 + \~4000

= \~£6500 per month  + the bonus coming at the end of March.

**Outgoings**

My core outgoings are relatively low:

\- £600/month rent + bills

\- £300 therapy (hopefully this will reduce soon but I need it for now)

\- £200 food

\- £100 misc (travel, subscriptions etc).

**Debt**

High interest loan with £6290 remaining balance, at £262 / month.  Only 1 month in of 2 years.  Amount to settle today would be £4404 so decent amount of money to be saved paying off early.

Short term loan with £2512 left to pay over 11 months at £228/month.  This one is even higher interest.

Capital one ccs x2 with £200 balance each

Zopa cc with £300 balance

Vanquis cc with £150 balance

I have been clearing all of these each month but intend to get rid of the Vanquis and one capital one, and keep zopa plus the other for shopping etc. to build my credit back up.

I also pay a family member £1k / month (no interest) to repay debt.

**Total Outgoings**

Core - £1200

Debt (not including ccs) -   £1490

= £2690

Can anyone help advise me what my plan should be going forward?

Including

\- what best to do with my bonus (I assume clear my debt)

\- how much I should aim to have in my bank account

\- what I should be investing in (previously tracker fund in stocks and shares isa)?

92,Credit bureaus report,My credit company reports on 27th this month but credit bureau is gonna update their page in like 29days. If I apply for a credit card tomorrow will the credit company see the old credit utilization or see the new report from today even though I have to wait a month to see it on my end. Asking because with my current report my utilization is high but with today's report it will be like zero.

93,How does my plan look?,"Hello PF, long time follower here. Posting on a throwaway, sorry if I'm breaking rules. I would just like some critiques on my current progress and my future plan.

Background:

27m
Live at home
Income: $75,000 (Expected 2.5%-3% raise yearly) 
Roth IRA: $20,050 (22% of bi-weekly paycheck)
403b: $19,375
Savings: $34,000

Monthly take home: $2,800
Monthly added to savings account: $2,200
401k Monthly Contribution: $1,200
Roth IRA Contribution: $6k at the beginning of the year, maxed for 2021. 


Currently looking to move out within 3 years. I figure I could save up at least $90,000 for a down payment on a Condo in the range of $350k-$400k. HOA is expected to be about $600mo.

My questions are as follow:
1) Am I over contributing to my retirement accounts? 
2) I am expected to have a side-job within a month or 2 that will bring in an extra $1,600 a month. I will save a portion of this, probably $600 but the rest I would like to invest. Do you have any suggestions? 

Thank you for reading and your critiques!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6biwu/how_does_my_plan_look/,"I’m in a similar situation to you so I would say you’re doing well. 1) I think as long as you can afford it, continue maxing and contributing to your retirement accounts. You never know what will happen in the future and if circumstances force you to lower your contributions. Plus if you decide to retire early your future self will thank you. 2) you could just keep all your side hustle money to go toward your down payment but otherwise just open a brokerage account and buy index funds.",1611773092.0,2
94,Will leaving Edward Jones hurt my financial advisor?,"So I have a family member who works at EJ and manages my money.  I’ve been thinking of leaving because I want to manage my own investments.  It’s not even about fees; I just want to be able to pick individual stocks but EJ does not seem to support that.

I’m concerned that my family member’s salary would take a hit if I did that.  Does anyone know if this is the case?  I only moved my assets to EJ to do them a solid, but now I feel like I fucked up because leaving them would hurt them.

Does anyone know what the repercussions would be if I left them?

Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6birg/will_leaving_edward_jones_hurt_my_financial/,"It should be about fees, because your family member is making fat and undeserved commissions off your hard earned dollars. Get out of there. The financial repercussions to your family member will be small unless you're holding millions with them. The repercussions to your relationship will depend on whether your family member has your best interests at heart or is a greedy dick hole.Financial advisors are always gaining and losing clients.   Unless your account is a large percentage of the assets he/she manages, your departure is a non-issue.

Ask her.   It is better to discuss with them in advance rather than them finding out when the transfer notice crosses their desk.You can always open a second brokerage account elsewhere and use that to trade.  There's nothing that says you can only have one.    

Honestly, this is why you aren't supposed to mix business with family.  Hurt feelings are inevitable. Don't put other people's financial situations above your own.Yes, they will take a hit. No, it should not affect them substantially or really noticeably (unless you have some massive account).",1611773076.0,0
95,Rolling over Roth 401k and employee match into Roth IRA,"I have an old Roth 401k with American Funds that I'd like to roll over into Fidelity; however, I also received a company match as well, that I assume is not post-tax. I was wondering if I need to open both a Rollover IRA as well as a Roth IRA?

I'm filling out the necessary form from American Funds and they only ask for 1 account number, would I have to fill out the same form again for the other account?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6bihi/rolling_over_roth_401k_and_employee_match_into/,"The company match should go into a Rollover IRA unless you want to pay taxes on it to put it in the Roth IRA.

Not sure about the second question. You may ask American Funds, or whomever you're transferring too if they will automatically split it or not.The employer match always goes into a Trad 401k, so yes, you would want to open two IRAs.

> I'm filling out the necessary form from American Funds and they only ask for 1 account number, would I have to fill out the same form again for the other account?

96,Parents went overboard on credit cards and now I need to find the best way to help them manage,My parents (70F and 72M) have been having some issues recently so I said I'd help them with sorting out their finances. I did not realize what I got myself into. Between the two of them they've got 30+ credit cards and are about $105K in credit debt. They're on a fixed income and are currently going over their monthly income by about $1500/month.

1. Bankruptcy
2. Get on a budget yesterday.

You might also want to look into being POA on their accounts to help manage (dpoa given their ages).There is absolutely no point in addressing the credit card debt until you address why they are in the negative by $1,500 a month. 

That's where you need to start. 

I would just use a simple excel document for a budget.just have them declare bankruptcyDo they have any assets? If not, the debt goes away when they die. 

If they have assets that they want to pass on to you, they should consider bankruptcy now.My sister (and her husband) is doing something similar with her in-laws.

They work with them on a budget, cancelled credit cards, and monitor stuff, closely. 18k in expenses is a lot to cut out though. 

Sister is using Dave ramsey's app
YNAB is pretty touted as being a good app for budgeting

97,Advice on savings/investing,"Hey everyone, 

Just looking for a little advice and guidance on what I should be doing for savings/investing.

I have a few things setup but I feel like I’m a bit all over the place. 

32 married with one child under 1. Household income 225k last year. 

Through my employer I have a pension (should be worth around 120-140k a year when I plan to retire (18 more years)... access to a 457 plan, 401k, traditional IRA, Roth IRA.

My wife is self employed. 

Our current situation is I am contributing 10% of my income to the 457, and 5% of my wife’s income to a SEP IRA at vanguard. Both are in target date funds.

We keep ~ 40k in an ally account for emergency fund and have no consumer debt. 

We have good health insurance through my employer so no HSA

I wanted to start a savings/investment plan for my daughter but everything I read tells me I should be maxing out all Tax differed retirement accounts before I consider Saving or investing in anything else and currently I’m not maxing out any. I only chose the 457 because I am eligible to retire young and wanted the access to the money without penalty at 50, but everything seems to suggest I should be maxing Roth IRA first. 

I’m trying to find a good balance where I can save and Invest in retirement for my wife and I, save and invest for my daughter when she’s older, possibly invest to generate some shorter term income/gains, and still pay all my expenses. 

Sort of looking for just an order of operations with this stuff to best reach our goals. Keeping in mind I’d like to retire from my day job at 50 to pursue my own ventures and not have to wait for years to touch that money without penalty. Should I be investing in any other of the accounts I have access to? Is my current setup good? 

Thanks In advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6bcvf/advice_on_savingsinvesting/,">invest for my daughter when she’s older

I have a 1-year old. FWIW, I don't think you need to save for your kid in that way unless it's possibly in a 529. Don't get me wrong. You need to save money and build wealth. But if that money is not in a 529 then it doesn't make any difference whether it's in a fund ""for her"" or for you and your family. You can just gift her your money whenever you want. Ands she gets all your stuff when you die. Whatever you saved will be hers.You may find these links helpful:

Some specific thoughts on your situation, though:

* You should always start by working towards your post-60 retirement. Even if you want some money early, you shouldn't prioritize that until you've actually completed saving enough to cover you from age 60 onwards, and that is best done through tax advantaged accounts. Once you have your regular retirement fully funded, pivot to early retirement saving.
* For your daughter - I would recommend first prioritizing your own future. You can always help her out later if you're in position to. Before just saving up general money, I would set aside money for education in a 529.
* Don't prioritize investments to generate present-day income unless you need it. Prioritize long-term growth until you're closer to actually needing income.",1611772624.0,1

File a police report if you want, sue in small claims.
