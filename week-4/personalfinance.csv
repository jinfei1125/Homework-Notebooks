Last March, we posted a [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fhrfqo/coronavirus_megathread_resources_discussion_and/) with tons of information about Coronavirus-related issues, and in September a [second megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) was posted with additional information on updates to payroll tax deferrals, student loan interest waiver, and unemployment. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic and recent U.S. governmental actions, we are posting a third installment of this megathread. **Please keep in mind that politics and political discussions are still not allowed here.**

# Stimulus Payments (updated Jan 5, 2021)

For the second round of stimulus payments: For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $600 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $1,200 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. For head-of-household filers, it is $600 if your AGI is below $112,500. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $600 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

As with the first stimulus - If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, your payment will be reduced by 5% of the difference between your AGI and the income threshold. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $600 is completely phased out once your income hits $87,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $2,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $174,000.

The [Get My Payment portal](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) has been updated to include information regarding the second stimulus. This is the first place you should check for the status of your stimulus payment. The IRS released a [statement](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-statement-about-economic-impact-payments) about the status you are seeing on the GMP portal for second stimulus payments:

* If there is a deposit date and account information, this is where your payment will be deposited.

* If there is mailing date for a payment, allow 3-4 weeks for your check or [debit card](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-e-eip-cards) to arrive.

* If you're getting Payment Status Not Available, you will have to wait until you file your 2020 tax return to receive the Recovery Rebate Credit.

**If you are not eligible based on your 2019 tax return, or are eligible for a larger amount based on your 2020 tax return, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year to receive the owed difference of the [Recovery Rebate Credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit).** Common cases where this applies:

* I never received the first stimulus, even though I believe I was eligible, and still get an error when checking the Get My Payment portal

* I was a dependent in 2019 (and/or 2018 if your 2019 was not yet filed for the first stimulus), or mistakenly indicated that I could be claimed as a dependent, but cannot be claimed as a dependent for 2020 (Note: You don't just decide if you're a dependent or not, verify if you are eligible to be claimed as one [as defined by the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p501#en_US_2019_publink1000196863).)

* I had a child in 2020 and am now eligible for the additional amount for a qualifying dependent

### **FAQs:**

* **Q** How will I receive my stimulus payment?

* **A** 2019 tax returns returns are being used to calculate each person's stimulus payment. The bank account information provided on your 2019 tax return, whether that be for a refund deposit or debit of owed payment, will be used for direct deposit of the stimulus. 

* **Q** When will I receive my payment?

* **A** The deadline for second stimulus payments to be sent is January 15, 2021. After this date, if you have not received the stimulus payment yet, you will have to wait to claim it as the Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 tax return.

* **Q** I closed the bank account that I used for my 2019 return, or I do not recognize the account that the Get My Payment portal says it will be deposited to. How do I get my payment?

* **A** If the account is now closed or if the account information does not match an account you own, the payment will be returned to the IRS. You will then have to wait until you file your 2020 tax return to receive the Recovery Rebate Credit.

* **Q** I am eligible for the both the first and second and stimulus based on my 2018 and/or 2019 tax return, but will not be eligible based on my 2020 tax return. Will I need to pay back what I received?

* **A** No, there was no information provided in the bills requiring payments to be returned if eligibility changes between the 2018/2019 and 2020 tax years. This is also noted in the [IRS FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-j-reconciling-on-your-2020-tax-return).

* **Q** The [Get My Payment](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) portal says the payment was already sent and/or I received Notice 1444 in the mail saying my stimulus was sent, however I never actually received it. What do I do?

* **A** See the IRS page on [Payment Issued but Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Not Received](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-f-payment-issued-but-lost-stolen-destroyed-or-not-received) for guidance on starting a Payment Trace

The IRS has an extensive list of [Economic Impact Payment FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center) and a [news release](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-and-irs-begin-delivering-second-round-of-economic-impact-payments-to-millions-of-americans) regarding the second stimulus with more information

Be aware of potential scams related to stimulus payments or other coronavirus relief packages. CNBC has a helpful article with examples of [common stimulus scams](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/29/stimulus-check-scams-here-are-red-flags-to-watch-for.html).

At this time, [a $2,000 stimulus has been proposed](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602024/second-stimulus-check-update-senate-kills-2000-payments), but has not been passed by Congress. If that changes we will update this information to reflect that. 

# Payroll Tax Deferral

Payroll taxes consist of two related taxes: Social Security (6.2% of wages) and Medicare (1.45% of wages). Both employees and employers pay these taxes (i.e., for every $1 of social security taxes you pay, your employer also pays $1). Only the Social Security portion of payroll taxes may be deferred right now, not Medicare.

The Secretary of the Treasury has been [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/) to defer the collection of Social Security taxes on those making a gross income of less than $104,000 / year ($4,000 or less per bi-weekly paycheck) starting September 1.

Implementing seems to be optional by employers and many employers have decided to not implement this.

The IRS had issued Notice 2020-65 indicating that taxes deferred must be withheld and paid between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021, or interest and penalties will start accruing on May 1, 2021. **The window to payback the deferred taxes has been extended under the new stimulus bill to December 31, 2021. Deferred taxes must be paid by January 1, 2022 or interest and penalties will start accruing.** 

See the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for FAQs regarding the payroll tax deferral 

# Coronavirus-Related Distributions from Retirement Plans

Penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts for Coronavirus-Related Distributions ended December 30, 2020. If you made one of these withdrawals during 2020, remember that you have three years to pay the income taxes on the withdrawal. The IRS has an article with [Coronavirus-related relief for retirement plans and IRAs questions and answers](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/coronavirus-related-relief-for-retirement-plans-and-iras-questions-and-answers) with more info.

# Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Rollover

FSA account balances typically do not rollover year-to-year. The second stimulus package allows for FSA balances at the end of 2020 to be rolled over and used in 2021. Any FSA balance remaining at the end of 2021 may also be rolled over and used in 2022.

# Unemployment Benefits

Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) provides benefits to individuals typically not eligible for unemployment insurance, such as independent contractors or gig workers. Under the CARES Act these benefits were set to expire Dec 31, 2020. It has now been extended to March 14, 2021. Please visit your state’s PUA website for more information.

The previous unemployment relief of $300/week from the federal government and $100/week from the state expires Dec 26, 2020 (see the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for more information and FAQs regarding [this executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/) from August). **Under this new bill, federal unemployment will provide an additional $300/week through March 14, 2021, and the maximum number of weeks that unemployment can be claimed has been increased from 39 weeks to 50 weeks.**

**If you lost your job or are at risk of losing your job:**

Please read the information available in the [Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)

If you have any questions regarding those resources, feel free to ask here, but please be as specific as possible with your current situation and what steps you have taken so far.

# Student Loan Interest and Payment Waiver

The CARES Act suspended federally-held student loan payments and interest charges until September 30, 2020. The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/) signed in August extended this to December 31, 2020. The new bill has further extended this date to January 31, 2021.

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Most mortgage owners eligible for reduced or suspended payments for up to 12 months under the CARES Act 

Key points:

1. The CARES Act covers about [70% of all mortgages](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=406472) in the U.S. (those backed by Fannie and Freddie, FHA, VA, or USDA). Many companies have similar policies for most other types of loans. If you aren't sure what kind of loan you have, ask your servicer.

2. In most cases, you will [not owe the missed payments as lump sum](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/after-you-receive-relief/#repay). There was a lot of confusion about this. The new guidance says that lump sums are not required for [GSE](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Announces-Payment-Deferral-as-New-Repayment-Option-for-Homeowners-in-COVID-19-Forbearance-Plans.aspx) and [federal loans](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/SFH/documents/IACOVID19FBFactSheetConsumer.pdf).

3. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

4. Requesting mortgage relief/deferral will appear on your credit reports and may affect your eligibility for refinancing (but doesn't affect your actual credit score).

5. For more info, the CFPB published [step-by-step information](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/housing) about how to request payment relief.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs. 

Effective Dec 1, 2020, refinancing mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will incur a 0.5% [adverse mortgage fee](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/refinancing-a-mortgage-will-cost-more-thanks-to-an-adverse-market-fee.html). 

# Relief for Renters

The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/) signed in August required certain federal agencies to take steps to limit foreclosures or evictions. It did not include a list of specific actions or policies. 

Following this in September, the CDC ordered [Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions To Prevent the Further Spread of COVID-19](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/04/2020-19654/temporary-halt-in-residential-evictions-to-prevent-the-further-spread-of-covid-19) that expires December 31, 2020. **The new bill extends this order through January 31, 2021.**

Read [Protection for Renters](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/) from the CFPB and visit the [NLIHC page for COVID-19 Rental Assistance programs](https://nlihc.org/rental-assistance) for additional information and resources

Anyone have any insight into tax advantages of working from home?  Before quarantine, I had never done it but I have a friend whose job has always been home based.  He’s made comments about how he gets some type of tax benefit from working from home. Anyone able to shed light on this?

I have worked from home since 3rd week of March. I itemize my deductions.I have additional info on the 17-year old dependent question. My kid turned 17 in Sept 2020; I got my payment and it included the extra $600 for a dependent. I think the reason they say “under 17” is that kids turning 18 in 2021 still qualify.Since I have not been able to find anything online here is some information about my specific situation. I hope this will assist someone else.

I had H&R Block prepare my taxes in 2019. During this I selected that they take the tax return preparation fees out of my return. In turn the IRS sent my refund to H&R Block and then H&R Block sent my refund, minus their fee, to my checking account.

In April, I received the first EIP directly to my checking account. No issues.

I checked the ""Get my payment"" tool on the IRS's website today and saw that this second EIP payment went to a different account then the first. After some searching I went and looked at my 2019 return and saw that the account number that H&R Block gave the IRS matched the account number this second payment was sent to.

After sitting on hold for 80 minutes I was able to get ahold of someone who said that H&R Block would be processing this and sending it to my checking account, similar to my refund without any fees taken out, but could only say it might take a day or two. I will update this post when I receive the payment in my checking account.

&#x200B;

Update (1/5/2020): I received the payment in my checking account todayI just received the IRS deposit today and it was only $46.95 and I’m wondering if there was a mistake. 

My 2019 taxes I grossed $86,000 and my AGI was $73,800 after the standard deduction. 

With some back of envelope math I was expecting a $460 check. 

Anyone think this is right or a mistake? If this was a mistake who do I even contact to address this?Just making sure that I understand this correctly. I filed as a dependent for the 2019 tax season, in 2020 I turned 24 and moved out but did not receive my stimulus payments because of my 2019 tax filing status. 

This means I should be eligible for both stimulus payments when I file my 2020* taxes?

*Obviously I have lost track of the yearAnyone else get direct deposit the first time but now it's showing 'mailing' for their second?For those who did their taxes with TurboTax last year and have not got their 2nd stimulus (like myself), they just emailed me that millions of payments went into incorrect accounts and should be rectified within a few days.

Edit: I found a link on their website 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.turbotax.intuit.com/tax-news/why-havent-i-received-my-second-stimulus-check-48743/amp/So if I received the first payment based on my 2019 taxes but am not on eligible based on my 2020 taxes will I receive the 600?

On the flip side if I was ineligible and did not receive the payments based on my 2019 taxes but will be eligible based on my 2020 taxes will I be able to receive any or all of the 1800?I received my second stimulus check but still haven't gotten my first. The IRS page still says Payment #1 Status - Not Available. Is there a reason one could get the second payment and not the first? Do i just need to get my first through my 2020 tax filing?Question about dependent status. My fiancee was claimed as a dependent for 2019 tax year and as a result, did not get either stimulus payment. She supports herself, pays rent with me (we have lived together for 3 years) and she was a student until August 2020. 

Her parents were not paying more than half of her living expenses, she did not live with them. 

Can she file the recovery rebate form on 2020 tax return and get the full $1,800 plus whatever her normal tax refund might have been?",1609734845.0,227

Officially debt free!! It feels so good. Even though they were at 0% with the forbearance, our jobs weren’t impacted and wanted the mental satisfaction of being debt free after spending years crushing itPaid off my debt today! 2 years ago I took out a loan for an HVAC replacement. Then last year, I got a line of credit to cover the balance of my HVAC loan (slightly lower rate) and cover some concrete work. Today I reduced the LOC balance to zero, and I'm feeling good! Thanks to budgeting, a small promotion, stimulus money, and no vacations due to covid, I was able to pay off about 13k in 18 months.

Next up, I'm planning on increasing my emergency fund to 10k, then dumping everything extra into my 403(b) and HSA. Any other advice?I stopped crying about my financial situation and started doing something about it, and now I'm starting to grow wealth dramatically.

I even bought a house.  I do social work and the pay is really bad, but if you know what you're doing, you can build wealth! This sub has helped tremendously, and you are all wonderful people.  Thank you for proving the American Dream is still alive if you focus on it.

My last two years.  From nothing to over $24,000! (I also invested in some stocks like MSFT). I started spending less on personal wants and putting more in debts.  I also starting Door Dashing in my spare time and put all that extra money on debt.  Now I'm starting to compound wealth!

Time to start saving for a house!Just wanted to post that thanks to Gamestop stock and COVID saving over past 6 months, I am debt free. I have a payment going to my student debt right now to finish off the last portion of money owed. From $25k student loan and $10k CC 6 months ago to $0 in debt today with extra cash still. Was saving and investing while paying down the credit cards at the same time over past few months. I have had enough to pay off CC a little bit ago but the investments were outpacing the interest of the credit cards so I let them ride a bit. Ended up cashing out today at 280% returned in past 4 months. Income is about $110,000 and would have paid things down faster but my rent is a substantial. So right now with $0 debt and $15k in a savings account I am going to start putting money back into investing in a few weeks. Taking a small break to refocus and not get ahead of myself.**I prepared my own taxes for the first time today!!**

It took literally 6 HOURS but I finally did it. As a student, I thought I just had to fill out the 1040, but I also had state taxes for my home state, nonresident taxes for my internship, tax credits for the out-of-state income... at the end, I apparently have 2 refunds AND owe money for underpayment.

I haven't mailed them yet but I'm proud of myself!Probably irrationally annoyed that I'm still one 1099 short for 2020. Tax season doesn't even start until 2/12We just signed a 2.0% 10-year refi in California.  
That will end our mortgage in the same month as retirement.

Anyone else lock down a killer refi in this crazy low-interest moment?29F, Denver. I’m spending about $10k this year to avoid a bad roommate situation- am I making a huge mistake? I live in Denver with 2 roommates and signed a 12 month lease with them. One of them has become difficult to live with, just very selfish and has a horrible boyfriend that’s over all the time. I was hiding in my room 24/7 and it took a huge mental toll, made worse by the fact that my last living parent died this year. I cannot get out of the lease unless the other 2 agree and they won’t. Since I’m working remote, I moved to where my long-distance partner lives (Oregon) and we got a place for a few months and it’s been amazing. My mood is 1000x better and I’m loving life here. I’m seriously dreading returning to Denver, but I’m wasting about $10k on the remaining year of rent when I won’t even be there. I’m justifying it because I inherited around $1.5M from my parents and I have a good salary myself so I’m investing in my own happiness right now. I also started investing in the stock market this year and I’m up about $8k which almost covers the rent! Will I regret this $10k later in life or is it just a drop in the bucket?What’s the over/under on at least some student debt being forgiven before they’re unfrozen?

I am in the position to pay off my all-federal loans right now. I’d like to get it over with and off my radar but worry that I’d miss out on a free $10K+ later this year if it gets through a stimulus bill.",1611572407.0,9
2,"My senior parents (Ontario, Canada) say they'll be homeless in 2 months, but I can't imagine they've done all they can for their situation.","I'll be honest, I'm a 23 year old who knows nothing about money besides to save it, hence why I'm here.

My parents are seniors (68f, 70m). My dad has worked his whole life as a self contractor doing carpentry. He was working up until September where he got chest pains, went to the ER and found out he immediately needed a triple bypass heart surgery. He was in the hospital for two weeks for prep and tests, and then another two weeks or so for recovery. They've told him that he cannot go back to work anymore - especially something so labour intensive. It took him over a month to be able to walk for more than a few seconds and he still struggles with breathing, plus he constantly needs to take a ton of heart medication now (for the rest of his life). Plus now he's at high risk due to covid. My mom has small scale babysitting (under five kids) but that came to an end when covid started.

My dad is in a lot of debt. I don't know the exact number but I'm guessing close to 100k between all his credit cards. My dad has a lot of credit cards with interest rates as high as 20%, and he's too stubborn to find a better option because he refuses to admit he's made bad financial decision.

I believe my dad got his pension sorted out and gets $700 a month. My mom hasn't applied for hers because she said she'll get $400 at most so it's not worth the effort ($400 is better than $0 Imo). They don't get any other government support in Canada. They're also Polish citizens. I don't know the exact details but my mom is getting some retirement money in Poland but she can only get it when someone visits Poland and brings it back for her - which I'm not sure why. I don't believe my dad is getting anything in Poland.

My sister has been pushing for my dad to file for bankruptcy to help with the debts, which he seems to be in the process of pursuing. They don't own anything. They rent an apartment and borrow my brothers car when they need it. I paid for uni out of my pocket so they weren't affected by that either. Their rent is ~$1400, which is really cheap for our area. My dad made about 35k a year before. 

Is there any other financial assistance they can get? I just can't understand how two seniors can only be getting $1100 in support when the average rent in my city is $2100 and so many others seem to have found at least some top up through covid relief (especially since my dad can't work anymore and my mom is his caretaker) or elsewhere.

I hope I included all the important info. Please ask if there's anything I missed.

Edit: I just want to thank everyone so so much for their input. I never expected so many of you would take the time to help me our and offer advice to guide me and my parents through tough times. I wrote this up before work on a whim thinking I'd get a few responses if any. I wish I could reply to everyone individually. If anyone has asked a question I will try my best to get to it when it slows down at work. Thank you again!!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l65ey0/my_senior_parents_ontario_canada_say_theyll_be/,"Old Age Security: this pays roughly $7,000 per year, but that's assuming they've been Canadian residents for at least twenty-five. You can apply for this when you reach 65, and in your dad's case it would pay a bit more if he hasn't applied yet (you get a little bit more if you wait). My mother applied for this, and it was a PitA because she was not born in Canada. She had to provide a list of every place she ever lived, with dates.

OAS is ""attached"" to two programs, Guaranteed Income Supplement and GAINS. GIS can pay a lot, but it is reduced by half of the previous year's income, and I assume there's a reduction for people who weren't very long-term residents of Canada. A married couple who earned no money beyond OAS (roughly $14,000 between the two of them) would end up with $24,000 per year. GAINS is a similar Ontario program, paying $1,000 *per year* (for a single person, I don't know what a couple would get). I suspect they don't qualify. You don't have to apply for either program separately, you just apply for OAS if you haven't done so already.

Canada Pension Plan: the amount paid is variable, depending on how much was paid in (so it's lower if they weren't residents for very long purely because they would have contributed $0 for those years). If someone worked under the table they won't get any, but it sounds like your father was honest. You can apply for CPP as early as age 60 and the amount will increase if you wait until age 70. The fewer $0 contribution years, the better, and if your mother's income is very low, she is not contributing, and is just hurting her figures.

Assuming your father has not filed bankruptcy before, he should file. It's not a ""get out of debt free"" card, and will come with financial counselling. It's not free, but I suspect he will only have to pay the minimum amount of $1,800 (paid at a rate of $200 per month, as the typical bankruptcy takes nine months).

You might not be the best source of advice, since IME parents have a hard time taking advice from someone they used to give advice to. I would hope the bankruptcy advisor would tell them the same things I'm telling you (frankly they will know more than me).

Your mother might qualify for CERB/CRB even if she was self-employed. Note that she had to make $5,000 of *net* self-employment income and report that on her taxes to qualify.Polish immigrant here:  

cpp and oas is a no brainer  get both parents on it STAT.  

polish pension. can EASILY be accessible here. ZUS which is the entity in poland that pays out the pensions, definitely has an option to deposit money into a canadian bank account. I know this because i helped my parents set this up.Your mum really should apply for her pension. $400/month until the day she dies is NOT something to scoff at. All she needs to do is fill out the forms.

I'm guessing your parents have lived paycheque to paycheque. $35000 would be about $29,000 post tax assuming the default tax brackets and no additional tax reliefs are applicable. Outside of CPP (Canadian Pension Plan), look into GIS/OAS.

Stay calm. Polish Boomers freak out if you get upset or swear at them, even when they're difficult. I have to meditate for 30 mins before helping my parents.In general old age support (canada pension, U.S. social security, etc) isn't intended to be a full income replacement. It's intended to provide a portion of income replacement, with the rest to be made up through some combination of private savings (private pensions, investments, etc.)

Your parents along with many other in their age cohort I might add, unfortunately, haven't done that. Many old people are currently making ends meet by selling off their house equity. Make sure to learn from their example.Sounds like there is nothing tying them down to this high COL area. Moving to a lower COL area would go a long ways towards helping their situation.Look into whether your Dad can apply for Disability. My mom is on it and is $800 per month. File for a consumer proposal as it’s cheaper and less restrictions./r/PersonalFinanceCanada is probably a better spot for this post.

Ontario isn't enforcing evictions right now due to covid (and AFAIK they normally don't in the winter time anyways even during non-covid times) so even if your parents landlord filed and was approved for an eviction under the LTB, they won't actually literally be kicked out the door just yet.If “not worth the effort” is code for “I tried, but the paperwork was too scary/complicated” a lot of seniors centres used to offer help with stuff like that (at least in the before times).",1611757111.0,1288
3,Always ask for proof of debt!,"I got an email about a $200 debt from a collection company. I called and they said I made a transfer of that amount in November of last year, but that account had been closed since February. I asked them to send me proof, and they sent me a letter stating that my balance wasn't paid in full. I called today to again request proof of the debt, and he said since it's such a small amount they'll just drop the whole thing and won't report anything to the credit bureaus. I did research the company and they're legit, and I legitimately didn't owe the money, but it's always a good idea to make collections companies send proof before paying them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l65ma2/always_ask_for_proof_of_debt/,">. I called today to again request proof of the debt, and he said since it's such a small amount they'll just drop the whole thing and won't report anything to the credit bureaus.

You might want to get this in writing. I will bet it shows up on your credit report in a few months.I had a debt collector call me once saying that I owed money on a utility bill from my previous apartment. (I legitimately owed the money, it was like $40.)  I said I wasn't going to give anyone that I didn't know money over the phone and they were stupid for thinking I would just hand over money because they said I owed them. I hung up on them and called the utility company who said that I did owe them the amount the debt collector stated but that it didn't go to collections yet. I paid the utility company and made sure I had proof of payment. Never heard from the debt collector again. Just wanted to share a similar story.Yep, certified mail asking for proof of debt and itemized bill. Once you ask for it debt collectors legally have to stop contacting you or take any action on the debt until they provide this (at least in my state)

I did this for an old apartment that had sent $700 to a debt collector, I texted my roomates about the debt and that I would send debt collector a letter. The debt collector sent me back a letter ""your name has been removed from this account"". In this case we legitimately owed them new carpet because one roomate had a filthy dog and spilled an entire bottle of nail polish into carpet.

SIX YEARS LATER.... my roomate/ex-girlfriend messages me out of the blue, ""hey I have $700 derogatory note on my credit report do you know anything about this?""

Like wtf you didn't listen the first time I told you AND you didn't check your credit report for SIX YEARS?!Maybe someone who understands debt can explain to me better...

How does proof of debt actually prove anything? Can't they just say you owe them money even when you don't?

I had a therapist whose office was notoriously bad at bookkeeping. I would get bills in the mail every month, take them to my therapist, who would say ""oh they just haven't processed your payment yet"" and the charge would disappear in a month (with a new one in it's place)

So after I stopped seeing that therapist, I got one final bill in the mail. I waited a month for it to go away like usual, but instead it got sent to collections. I knew I didn't really owe money, so I just avoided the calls, since I didn't think they had proof. FIVE years later, I slipped and answered the call from collections. I asked for proof of debt. They said they had it. A week later, I receive a letter from my therapist, that says ""I confirm that ekyou owes me this money, signed \[therapist\]"" 

So at this point it's been 5 years, I don't have good documentation to prove I paid, and it's like, $80. So I just paid the stupid thing. A week later I get a check from my therapist in the mail with the money back, saying ""whoopsie, sorry, you did pay this""

So... what was that ""proof"" then, exactly?I always request proof. There's someone in another state with my same first and last name who owes a bunch of child support, back taxes, and had a bill from a cable company come to me. 

Once they send the info showing the debt belongs to the other Noinipo, I tell them that I'm not her and I never hear from them again. It just sucks that I have to pay for certified mail and track all this stuff just to keep my record clean from her poor finances.Years ago (2008 recession)  I had some outstanding CC debt that was sold off to debt collection company. The amount that collection company claimed (approx $25K) that was owed seemed to be significantly higher then what I remembered the actual amount (Approx. $12K) . They called several times and I asked them each time to please send me written proof of the number. I never disputed the fact that I had debt (I didn't claim it was this debt) but I told them every time their numbers made no sense. I then followed up with a certified letter requesting proof or removal from my history within 30 days and sure enough after about 2 months it was gone. Late last year I received a letter from a new creditor who had bought the debt for what ever they could. The best part of this letter was, it said ,as the time to had passed (now 13 years) they have no recourse to enforce the request nor could they sue me or report to my credit report but they'd be ""happy to settle with whatever I'd be willing to pay""I agree, get proof, I had an old bill pop up on my credit report for $7xx, asked for proof which after a month they sent, in the email was the last 3 bills for an account I had paid off in full 18 months prior, showing 2 over due amounts and the 3rd one was for the $0 balance..... I got sneakily snarky with them and they went, "" huh, guess it is paid, our bad, let us get the final sign off on it...."" 


Worst part was, got that email and THE NEXT DAY! someone from the same office sent me the same $7xx spiel, so I referred them to the person I was talking to in their office..... LolI’ve been dealing with a similar issue where Verizon fucked up and charged me $50 on an account I didn’t have access to for Disney+ I didn’t want or ask for. They sent it to a debt collector who harassed me for weeks before I sent them the certified mail receipt and then didn’t hear from them for a while. Turns out they sent it to ANOTHER debt collector who is now sending me a photo via text message that tells me to contact them every day. I’m in the process of filing a complaint but it’s $50 leave me alone.I've tried this.  What I got back was a ""this debt is valid"" letter with no additional information.  I simply didn't pay it and ignored it.What would actually constitute proof? Like the collection agency could just have a bill, but unless you signed for it or something, how do they prove that bill is 1) valid or 2) you haven't already paid for it (in cash possibly)?

If you just maintain that you either never had those services provided, or that you paid the bill already then how would they ever collect any debts?",1611757766.0,1003

That should be the first place you invest, but only up to the match amount. Next, paying off the student loans should be your top priority. Not as fun as setting up and a Roth IRA and investing, but the saved interest is a 100% guaranteed return on your money. Once the student loans are taken care of you can direct that payment to a Roth IRA and saving for a house. How you split those amounts ultimately depends on how soon you want a house and how much you want to pay for it.You should take a look at The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins (book on Amazon) it covers all the basics very well.

7,Student Loan Forbearance,"Good Morning,

I have a question about the student loan forbearance that was passed today.  I have just under 10k in debt and if I keep paying my student loans I can be done in around 2.5 years at the same $400 a month payments.  I have also heard about the possibility of loan forgiveness from the Biden administration and that was around 10k.  So my question is, should I continue paying the $400 a month that I can make or should I take advantage to save money and if the loan forgiveness goes into affect, then I will have all the debt gone.  My concern today is if I make payments from now till September, it is interest free.  So if I were to hold off on paying them for these remaining 8 months, I would still have the same amount and then continue paying it with the same interest.  I am just lost on where to go with the forbearance and the possibility of forgiveness in the future.  Thanks to all that have read.

&#x200B;

Thanks to everyone who commented.  This helped me a lot and I feel confident in what I should be doing in these unprecedented times.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l68xvx/student_loan_forbearance/,"There's functionally no difference between making your monthly payments as normal compared to just making one large lump sum the day before the 0% interest expires.I think it may be smart to put your $400 monthly payment into a savings account while the loan is still at 0% interest. That way you can wait and see if more information comes in that time about student loan forbearance. I think it is important that you mentally treat this money as already spent and don’t count on getting it back.You could stick the money you would be paying on the student loans in a separate account until we hear if the forgiveness goes through. If it does then you just banked a bunch of money. If not then you have a big payment you can throw at one of the loans and be in the same position you would have been in if you had continued making payments, plus whatever interest you earned in the account.

Obviously this only works if you're disciplined enough to not spend the money while it sits in an account.I know we're all not making payments now, but keep in mind Loan Forgiveness is only available for loans that are in good standing.  That's fine for the time being, but if you go in default, you have to pay the amount outstanding before they can be forgiven, is how it works with current Loan Forgiveness programs (IBR, PSLF, etc.)  

One thing to consider, too: in current Loan Forgiveness programs, the written-off amount becomes taxable.  So $10K forgiven becomes $10K as part of your tax liability at the end of the fiscal year.  Prior to This Year of Plague(TM), my tax pro told me ""well, that'll be the year you refinance your mortgage"" to have some sort of off-setting credit.  

No idea whether any of the forgiveness programs now address the tax liability issue of forgiveness, though...  I can see this being a huge PITA if it's not explained to borrowers",1611766743.0,15

I have tried to look for refinancing but since I am international and on a student visa (in the US) I haven't found any options. I am not in a position to pay the loan off right now so I would like to find a way to refinance it. Most loans require a cosigner and I don't have one. Any private lenders anyone know of? Any suggestions appreciated! Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l65unq/student_loan_refinancing_options/,"At the end of the day, refinancing options will depend on the student loan amount, income level and another other debts you have. A lender is not going to refinance a student loan for someone they deem high risk. The co-signer should have known the risk and responsibilities before signing and putting you in this situation.

What is loan amount?

What your income? 

Other debts?I refinanced a few years ago, but somewhat regret it.  I refinanced to get a lower rate, and there hasn't been any interest on federal student loans for the last year and there won't be for the rest of the year.  With Democrats controlling all of government, there will likely be some form of student loan forgiveness in the near future, which you *absolutely will not qualify for* if you refinance.  

Think long and hard about whether refinancing is worth it right now.  If you have a private loan, then I found SoFi to be quite good.SoFi is one place I know that does student loan refinancing, but you'll have to do research on whether or not you can refinance through them due to your status. Good luck to you.I received a few refinance offers in the mail some months ago and investigated.  I found [this site](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/student-loan-refinancing/) to be helpful when considering my options. A few of them did not let me refinance from my federal co-signed loan with my father, but a few definitely did. Most of them have a program that only requires some information (can't remember what exactly) to tell you whether you can or can't refinance and at what rate.

In the end, I settled on using Splash Financial.  My experience was fine and my rate was lowered in the end with the loan now completely under my name. Hope this helps.I always recommend Credible since they compare rates across multiple lenders. Earnest is my favorite lender for those looking to not have a co-signer.The likelihood of being able to refinance it is very low - you need to have enough income to meet the debt to income ratio and good credit. If someone is willing to refi for you without proof of income, you’ll be paying a ridiculous interest rate. Try talking to your school’s financial aid department and see if they have any resources to help, but without a co-signer you likely cannot do anything to get the current co-signer off of the loan.I've used and had good results from Earnest. I haven't been in a position to require a cosigner in about 10 years so I'm not sure if they do or not, but that holistically depends on your financial situation as well.",1611758531.0,10
10,How much do I really need to set aside for taxes?,"I've been a 1099 worker for the last 8 years or so, with only one W-2 job that lasted a year.

It was only like $20, so that was worth it to me to not have to bother with taxes all year round. I've never done estimated payments, and I've done a crappy job putting aside money for taxes. Usually I just hope I have enough saved come tax time and pay the lump sum. But starting this year, I'd like to start setting aside a certain percentage of my income so I don't need to worry about it. 

Thing is, I could always get my tax rate way down using deductions, so I never paid anywhere near the standard 25% they tell you to set aside. I feel like that's a huge chunk of cash I could be using for other things. Have any of you set aside something like 15% and it was enough?

If nothing has changed significantly, you can base it off the previous year's taxes.

If things have changed, you can go ahead and fill out your taxes for next year (but not send it in), see what you'll owe, divide by 12, and set that aside each month.I am S-Corp and have been putting away 10-15% in a high interest savings account every year and end up having more than enough to pay my taxes.Might be worth taking to an accountant and setting up a plan30% and you'll have some savings at the end of the year.",1611762721.0,10

Finally it just has about 7 hkd in it and they have put it in a suspended status forever (or until I can come in person to close it).

Definitely keep money in there if you haven't settled your taxes. Also when you do transfer, see if you have a USD account as part of your bank account, it was cheaper to change it to USD directly through the bank and then transfer it than to transfer HKD to USD in the US.",1611768723.0,7
12,Debt collectors keep passing a debt around so it appears to be opened recently -- messing up my credit. What can I do about that?,"I have this apparent medical debt that went to collections back in 2019. It's for a bill I paid in full to a hospital, but they are saying it could be the physician's bill. However, I was never sent a bill for that, and didn't even know such a thing existed until it popped up in collections and I called about it. I even called the hospital the first time it showed up and they said the company isn't their collections people, so it could be a scam -- hence I never went further with it.

I've been reporting it to the credit bureaus whenever it pops up and they eventually remove it, but then it just pops up again under a different company a few months later. So I'm curious if there's a more permanent way to deal with it.

I just called the most recent company and asked them to send me verification, which they said will take 6 weeks (to send a letter 2 states...)

The main problem is that whenever it pops up in the credit bureau sites, the ""Opened"" date is about 2 months prior. It doesn't show the original date which would be almost 3 years ago by now, so there are a few things I'm curious about:

1. Does this new ""Opened"" date count as if the start of the collections was on that date? I got the notification letter on Jan. 22, it's postmarked for Jan. 5th, but my credit report says the account was opened on Dec. 3rd. 2020.

2. If so, does that affect how long it can stay on my credit report according to the statute of limitations?

3. Is there anything I can actually do about it?

Thanks for any advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6cezp/debt_collectors_keep_passing_a_debt_around_so_it/,"It should be showing on your credit report as a 'collection account' - this tips off anyone looking at your credit report that it is not an active, open account but rather one that is being handled by a collection agency (ie, old debt).

It will be removed within seven years from the date of the last payment of the original (non-collection) account.  If you pay it, legally the collection agency doesn't _have_ to remove it, you would have to work out something with them to do so.

It will affect your score until it is removed.  I'd recommend talking to a lawyer that specializes in debt collectors.  A lawyer can advise on how to proceed and if the debt collectors are violating any laws in how they are proceeding with the debt, your lawyer can sue for an easy payday.  

There are lawyers that specialize in dealing with debt collectors.  Find one in your state and let them handle it.This appears to be a surprise medical bill. There is some efforts to legislate a ban on these ""out of network"" in a in network facility, but that doesn't help you at this point. 

You might check with your health insurance company from the period. It might list the doctor and how much was and wasn't covered. That might be the source of the bill, but it might also reveal that the insurance has already paid, and the charges are bogus.Easy way to fix it is pay it then work with the collector to get it removed from your report.  Reaching out to them is the best option.",1611776007.0,4
13,Taking out a small loan to fund home renovations: bad idea or not?,"Maybe you guys can offer insight into a debate I'm having with my spouse. If you have funds to cover a small home renovation, of around $5,000, is it better to pay for the renovation upfront or take a loan to cover the renovation and invest the funds instead?

Then if you choose to learn more about investing, you will get to the point where you know how to evaluate fund choices, and then you can reevaluate your options and make any changes that you see fit.What's your income? In lower tax brackets, Roth is better.

Do they provide a targeted retirement date fund? Like a 2050 retirement fund?

If not, find the broad market fund they have. What's the expense ratio? Hopefully less than 0.5%.

I'd go with 100% in either of those. You're too young for bonds (the target retirement funds will auto adjust their portfolio to include more bonds as you age).The target 2060 is likely a good pick, depending on the expense ratio. It will allocate the stocks/bonds appropriately as you approach retirement. The further out date you pick, the more aggressive (less bonds, more stocks) it will be. I don't think you need bonds in any large amount until 50-55, hence the 2060 pick.Regarding Traditional/Roth: if you're single *or* if you're married and your spouse works, I'd go Traditional. If you have a family and are the sole earner, I'd go Roth.

(Because it comes down to your current tax bracket. If you're in the 22% bracket, go pretax. Below that, go Roth).

Regarding fund choices, I'd go with 80% ""VANGUARD INST INDEX PLUS"" and 20% ""VANGUARD DVLPD MRKTS IND INST"" .What are your options?

>What about age based investments?

Some of these are great, others not as good. Depends on the set available to you. They are usually fully diversified inside themselves and designed to be the only fund you hold.

>Money Market?

This is basically just like a savings account. Probably tied to the Fed Rate but not too the stock market. Should be very safe but expect very low returns.

19,What to do with a small pension,I was wondering if I should keep a small 20k pension that pays 4% or should I move it somewhere else?

4% is a shitty ass rate. 

Also don't assume it's safe from the ups and downs of wall street. Is this a private company pension? Don't forget about Enron. Those people thought their pensions were safe too.assuming this is cash balance pension.

I have a CB pension with about 20k as well... paying 4% interest.

At a guaranteed rate, you cant beat it, but should you pull it out and get into equity? that is the question.

Short answer is horizon. If you have 20 years until retirement you are likely better off getting it into an IRA. But its hard to give up a floor rate that is 2x higher than the 30 year T rate[removed]>I suppose it is nice to know a small chunk of money is safe from the ups and downs of wall street


What makes you think it's safe?

Pensions go away all the time.  They collapse, get raided, company goes belly up.. all sorts of things.

Can you just take a lump sum?  What would that amount be?  And how often does it pay the 4%?  Monthly?  Yearly?Pensions are defined-benefit plans. You'll get the same distribution every year, no matter what the economy or broad markets are doing.

20,"Critique my budget and help me find where I can do better, please!","Hello,

I am 25M, a few years out of college and have a stable finance/accounting job. I built up my emergency fund to about 10.2k last year and it is sitting in a HYSA at Ally. I also have a Roth that I have built up to around $5300 and a 401k that is at $18,500.
I put all my expenses on credit cards that I pay in full off each month. I also have a separate savings account ($3,100) that I am using to save up to buy a home. 

How my budget currently breaks down:

Pay Check: $3,710/mo

Rent/Utility/Insurance: $ 765/month

Car Insurance: $140/mo (I live in Philadelphia but I have a clean driving record, good coverages, and the highest deductible of $1000)

Fuel: $65/month

Groceries $350/month

Subscriptions: $50/month (AMZ Prime, Philo, & OF)

Phone installment: $25/month

Savings/Investment Breakdown:

401k: $875/mo pre-tax (I contribute $10,500/year or 11% with a match of 4% from my employer, fully vested immediately)


EF: $0/month (fully funded IMO at $10,200 but will top it off if I overdraft from auto transfers to myself/CC statement balances)

Vacation: $210 month

Roth IRA: $500/month

I currently live with 2 roommates which is why my living expenses are pretty low. I try to save as much money per month (usually around $1100/mo) towards my house down payment. I have about $2,000 in a checking account but that is just to pay bills. I also am actively working through a bit of an online shopping addiction (I spend ~$300/mo on items whether it be personal or gifts).

I am looking for open and honest feedback. I feel like I am managing well but I worry about my home expenses going up and not being able to curb my spending.

Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l660k0/critique_my_budget_and_help_me_find_where_i_can/,"You're knocking it out of the park at your age and where you are. As long as you can curtail the shopping, you'll be fine.

Just beware that as your income rises, so will your desire to spend. Lifestyle inflation is real and you gotta keep it in check to ensure that you're finances will be protected.

Edit: Former Philly resident! I now understand how your rent/utilities/insurance is so low (even with the roommates).You're doing great, and your expenses are very reasonable.  The only thing to look at is whether you're happy with the shopping purchases you're making a month or two later.  If so, that's fine, but if not, I'd put some guard rails in place: for example, waiting a day or two on any shopping purchase over $50, and a week on anything over $100.  Regardless, set a budget for your shopping and stick to it.I would use everydollar, at least the method if not the free app. I didn't calculate but its clear you don't include personal spending or eating out categories. Life is short. You are saving with roommates so I would splurge a little elsewhere. Also are you planning on having roommates when you buy a house? If so financially depending onthe mortgage, number of rooms/roommates it may be a good idea financially to buy sooner while interest rates are lower. You would have to see what your mortgage payment would be compared to the rent now, but some people have their mortgagd entirely or mostly covered by having roommates!If you like to spend 300 a month shopping don't stop. Don't start the poverty finance crap if it isn't something greater you are aspiring too. Don't stop doing things that you enjoy or you'll just regret it later. Seen that a few times in this reddit.How many people are you feeding on $350/month?These seem like good healthy numbers! But one thing I notice off the bat is that most of your numbers are very rounded. Most line items are clean and rounded to the nearest 100, 50, or 25 if it's small. That makes me think these are more theoretical numbers that you determined are ideal, rather than an average of what you've observed that you actually spend. Which is a completely fine place to start, but it's just good to be aware that your goal numbers may shift to more specific non-pretty numbers as life happens. Like, my subscription line in my budget is $19 and my grocery line is $329 because that's what they have settled out into an average with time.

I also don't see some common categories, or a catch-all section other than shopping. Covid probably influenced some of these so maybe they are indeed zero, but later might not be. Some categories off the top of my head that I don't see on your list: haircuts and personal care, health insurance, routine medical, auto maintenance/registration, going to the movies, concerts, dating, restaurants, bars, pet care, charity.When was the last time you switched up your car insurance company? Companies usually quote lower than usual to attract new customers.Biggest area for improvement I don’t see listed is investing in your career (e.g., a plan for getting promoted, landing a better job, or starting your thing). You already save a meaningful portion of your paycheck (401k, Roth, and House fund savings are over 50% of your listed paycheck). Tweaking your budget is a relatively minor lever to increase your wealth at this point. Starting a side hustle (Is Philly real estate still cheap and profitable to rent?) or doubling your earnings over the next 5-10 years is a big lever (e.g., move into management/the partnership, start your own accounting firm, go into a more lucrative part of finance).

Minor note, on your numbers - I am getting 4,380 saving/spending vs. 3,710 paycheck? Is the 401k amount and your taxes deducted before you get the 3,710 paycheck number?",1611759080.0,6

I have been doing my pre-reqs for nursing school and just applied! I will find out if I was accepted in February. We are going back to school at 29 and 30 to increase our earning potential after many years of restaurant and tourism work (and lots of traveling and fun too!)

We live in a high cost of living town: Moab, Utah. The wages are not very competitive and the median home price is in the $400,000s. I feel very discouraged seeing prices like that...granted we are hoping to see our incomes increase as we move along but I feel like prices like that will lock us into the rat-race for eternity!! We have also been here for a few years and I feel like there is a whole wide world out there we can still see and I don't want to get ""trapped"" here.

We are super active--we love biking, hiking, surfing, long boarding, snowboarding...basically anything outside and active we enjoy! We have really been missing the ocean, and would love to try and find a spot by the ocean in the future. If not by the ocean, we want quick and easy access to biking and hiking trails. We are bike commuters and ride our bikes to work, to the store, and to friends houses. We love to not have to drive a ton; I grew up in suburbia and do NOT miss that.

Something else that is important to us is diversity, specifically the Spanish language. My husband is an immigrant from South America and we don't have a whole lot of diversity down here in Southern Utah. We would love to find an area where there is more Spanish spoken; I think it would help my husband a lot with his homesickness.

We still have a few years before we finish our degrees, but I need to find some hopefulness right now in thinking about future possibilities. Sometimes I just get too disheartened here about ever being able to buy a home. I would love any thoughts/suggestions/recommendations for cool places we could move to in the future!

24,Late 20s and In Serious Need of Financial Advice,"I am a 26 year old single male in serious financial strife. Years of utter financial illiteracy and ill-informed decisions I have made have me deep in a hole. I am at a total loss as to how to even begin getting myself out.

Coming from an impoverished family, I was determined to not continue this generational poverty, so I attended a four-year university and attained my degree. This was entirely self-funded, and working relentlessly while continuing my education elongated my time at the university more than anticipated. I graduated at 24. Immediately following college, I found that potential employers were reluctant (to say the least) to even grant me interviews without professional work experience or a Master's degree. I was stuck as a supervisor at my mediocre college job for eight months following graduation. I finally was hired on with a reputable company earning livable pay in early 2020. However, that only lasted five months before the consequences of the pandemic resulted in my lay off. I was unemployed for a month and a half before I had no choice but to return to my small hometown to accept a typically low-paying, unstable job in the restaurant industry. I'm now lucky if I gross $1,200 a month. With sparse job opportunity in my surrounding area, I have had no choice but to live a nomadic couch surfing lifestyle for months, which is obviously quite humiliating. I would love to relocate in search of an area with more opportunity for me to thrive, but my financial reserves have run dry and I have no resources to draw upon (or even a cosigner) to aid me if I even find an affordable place to live.

My financial details:

\-Amassed nearly $28K in student loan debt attaining my degree.

\-Currently owe $14k on a car loan ( ≈ $400/month)

\-Approx. $5,000 in credit card debt (now in collections)

\-Approx. $1,600 in medical debt (also now in collections)

\-Credit score fallen to about 480

&#x200B;

Going into college, I felt immensely confident that I had a bright future. My credit score was damn near perfect and my ambitions were serving me well. In just a few years, it feels as though all is now in shambles. With this towering deficit attached to my name and my reliably low earnings, I am exhausted attempting to survive financially day to day. Needless to say I have not had the opportunity to plan for emergencies or even find an affordable health insurance plan. Any advice is welcome as I am willing to do whatever is needed to get my finances on track and move toward a more hopeful future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6dkid/late_20s_and_in_serious_need_of_financial_advice/,"First thing i'll say is this. It feels like you're in a hole so deep that you can't get out of it. This simply isn't true. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. My first question would be this, are you upside down in the car? If not, the first thing i'd do is sell it and get the cheapest reliable car you can (or go without a car at all if possible this would help out immensely. with no car payment you could pay your medical debt in 4 months)
. Take whatever the difference in payment (if any payment left at all) and put that towards your other debts. If you truly want to eliminate this debt, you simply must make more money. Get a 2nd job. No matter how unappealing. This has two benefits. Firstly you bring in more money. Second, psychologically it will empower you. It will also have the benefit of making you money while not being able to spend money by keeping you busy.

It should be pretty simple to set up an income based repayment plan on your student loan (granted I've never had private student loans so if yours are private someone else might be able to help you). If you are able this should make your monthly payment pretty reasonable given your current income. 

Seeing as how your other debts are currently in collections paying one off before the other wouldn't have much of a benefit. Others might recommend differently but I'd pay off the smallest one first (interest isn't a factor in these debts anymore). Then I'd pay off the next largest.

At the end of the day the amount of debt you have isn't particularly large. It feels large, but much of it is quite manageable. I'm sure others have different ideas, but as someone who has been in a similar situation the psychological bump you get from taking chunks off, no matter how small, is huge.

Edit: I know none of this addresses your housing situation and I wish I had better advice in this area but I don't. Short of moving in with your parents (which isn't always an option) look to see if someone in your town is renting a room for cheap. I did this while in school for a while. It wasn't a horrible situation, but it was financially viable.

Edit 2: Thinking about your housing situation AND your financial situation. There is an industry that makes you more money AND addresses your housing issues. Long haul truck driving. At the bare minimum you'd at least double your monthly income to start and you live in the truck except on your days off (which, probably you could stay in if you wanted anyway). Extra bonus on top of this, many of the larger outfits will pay for and even train you to get your CDL. Is it glamorous? No. But, who cares. Having a CDL opens up huge opportunities. I've had mine for 15 years and has opened up many opportunities that aren't necessarily in truck driving. Being able to see the country can be cathartic. It reminds you that the world is big and your problems are small in comparison. In my area you can get a home every night driving job that starts at $25/hr plus benefits with NO experience just need to graduate the school (or obviously having long haul experience would suffice as well). Just a thought, but I'd honestly at least consider it. Kills a few birds with one stone.What did you get your degree in?",1611779150.0,2

26,Newbie Alert - Need help understanding retirement options ( 401k vs Roth 401k vs IRA),"Hi personalfinance community! I learned a lot by reading some of the archived posts and the general wiki but wanted to create a post to discuss my questions. I am finally at a stage where we are able to contribute to retirement savings and my brokerage account but need some advice.   


Both my husband and I are on a work visa and in constant limbo - we never know the outcome of our visa renewal until it actually happens so there might come a time when we have to pack up and leave. With that being said, my company offers a flat 6% 401k contribution without me having to do anything on my behalf. We now have a few thousand dollars that we are able to put away each month so should this go into a retirement account or do we invest in mutual funds? I am trying to get my head around all the different options but honestly cant figure out if we should put the money in my 401K or a Roth 401k or an IRA and how much of it should go into investing in a brokerage account. We do not qualify for a ROTH IRA so that is not an option, unfortunately. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6d3u9/newbie_alert_need_help_understanding_retirement/,"401k is an employer sponsored retirement plan  
IRA is an individually managed retirement plan  
Roth in front of either determines whether the money is pre/post taxes.

e.g. Roth IRA is funded with money you already paid taxes on, traditional IRA is funded with money prior to you paying taxes on it.

That matters when it comes time to withdraw it. traditional accounts you have to pay income tax on withdrawal as if you newly earned the money in the year of withdrawal. Roth accounts you can withdraw tax free (since you already paid taxes on it).

Traditional 401k has a higher limit of ~19k/year, but you can't withdraw contributions without penalties, though you can take a loan from the account without penalties subject to some restrictions.

These differ from a standard investment account like so:

Standard investment account = pay in using post-income tax money, when you sell investments at the end, you pay capital gains tax on the difference between your initial investment and the final selling price.

ROTH IRA = pay in using post-income tax money, when you sell investments at the end, you pay no taxes on the difference between your initial investment and the final selling price.

Traditional IRA = pay in using pre-income tax money, when you sell investments at the end, you pay income taxes on whatever you withdraw.

---

Generally the advice is to max out the traditional 401k, since it reduces your tax burden now, making it easier to save. Putting 10k into a 401k in this way effectively only costs you 7k right now, since you are avoiding paying taxes on it right now. You are likely to be earning less in retirement, so you will pay less taxes then than you would now.",1611777956.0,2

28,401(k) + Roth IRA vs. Roth401(k),"Hey everyone, 

I (21/m) just started my first full-time job. I am deciding which path to choose, having either: 401(k) + RothIRA vs. solely a Roth401(k). I finished ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich"" by Ramit Sethi and just came across some information in ""Money Master the Game"" by Tony Robbins. 

My initial thought was to contribute to my 401(k) to the point that my employer would match the contribution + x% (free money). I also planned on maxing out my RothIRA annually ($6,000 annual contribution limit). I prefer a Roth because I fully expect my taxes to increase as I progress in my professional career. 

I just came across the information that within a Roth401(k) the annual contribution limit is $19,500 --> I assumed it would be the same limit as a RothIRA but I stand corrected. I am aware that the employer match would be added tax free and that I would have to pay taxes on the employer match at withdrawal, but the significantly increased annual contribution has me leaning towards solely investing into a Roth401(k) despite the lack of funds I would have at my availability to invest in. As I previously stated, I prefer the Roth due to the tax-free withdrawal even though I am sacrificing potential gains that are sacrificed by investing tax-free money in a typical 401(k). I feel like contributing in solely a Roth401(k) would simplify my retirement accounts and make the process more seamless and simplified. Am I missing something here? 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Found out Roth401(k) has an annual contribution limit of $19,500 vs. Roth IRA is $6,000 --> So now am determining if I should invest solely into a Roth401(k) to simplify stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6cxi2/401k_roth_ira_vs_roth401k/,"Going the rIRA route typically opens you up to individual stocks/bonds/lower cost funds/etc vs only 'in company' funds which is appealing and your fee structure isn't tied to an employer so likely at some point in time you'll be moving this money or dealing with fees for non-contributing accounts.  Also you get some advantages to the rIRA vs the r401k. There's no required minimum distribution for an rIRA,   you can use earnings without penalty for a first time home purchase, and with an rIRA you can withdraw basis dollars at any time penalty free.  

It's 2021. 'Simplification' is dead when it takes 5 minutes to open an account online and never need to mail, write a check, or meet with a human.  Also unless you stay at 1 employer forever you're gonna roll this money to an IRA eventually.

TL'DR; get your 401k match, then prioritize rIRA max, then go back and fund your r401k to gain flexibility, reduce costs, and avoid RMDs in retirement.[Personal Finance Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Check out the link for the order of operations in how to get started. Once you have the basics down....

1. 401(k) up to employer match 
2. Max out rothIRA
3. Then go back and add additional funds into the 401k. 

You can invest in both. It is good to have a mix of pretax and post tax investments. That is ultimately your decision on what you think your future taxes will be like. 

If you have your own health insurance also look into an HDHP with an HSA. The HSA is triple tax advantaged. Pretax contributions, grows tax free and withdrawn (for health expenses) tax free.> I feel like contributing in solely a Roth401(k) would simplify my retirement accounts and make the process more seamless and simplified. 

It would but it's not that hard to have 2 or 3 accounts and a lot of places that offer Roth IRAs have a lot of other investment products that you'll probably want. Usually your employer 401k is with whatever their preferred institution is and unless you're lucky, the one you'd want your Roth IRA in is different. It might be worth it to manage the two accounts if you have a better choice of funds outside of your Roth401k. 

Of course, definitely take full advantage of the employer match. Once you're vested you *might* be able to roll it over to your preferred institution anyway.",1611777544.0,2
29,First year into working real job - will I ever be able to buy a house?,"Hi,

I am a 32yo teacher in Germany and started my full time teaching position about a year ago (i took a long time studying).

I always had the goal of owning a house one day so I started a special down payment program with my bank where I get a very low interest rate if I save up at least 30% of the total house cost.

I currently have a net income of 3300€/month and after a year of employment I am not sure anymore if I'll actually be able to afford a house in my lifetime without sacrificing everything else. Here is a breakdown of the situation and I'd be thankful for advice:

|net income|3300€|will go up very slowly|
|:-|:-|:-|
|rent|750€|will go down in 1 year|
|down-payment plan|500€||
|savings|300€|currently at 4k, goal is 10k|
|investing|200€|ETFs|
|utilities|150€||
|insurance |350€|necessary medical|
|subscriptions / phone / etc|100€||
|transportation|200€|car insurance, gas, bike repair, ...|
|food|250€||
|work / self improvment curses|250€||

So currently I have around 250€ left every month for entertainement, cloth etc. My job is very stressful for me so there is absolutely no chance of getting a second job ontop (I'm working around 60-70 hours / week including everything). With my position there is a pension of around 70% of my final income, so I'm not worrying about having money for retirement.

My rent / utilities is a bit high because I'm living in an appartement big enough to house me and my girlfriend who is still studing to become a teacher. In about 1 year she is going to live with me again so my rent / utilites will go down substantially by then (hopefully).

When I looked on the market I did not find any houses for less than 250k€, typically it would be more like 300k€. I currently have 18k in the down payment plan, 4k in savings and 3k in investments. So if my calculations are right I'd need at least 75k in my down payment plan, which would take around 10 years at my current savings rate. But if the housing market stays on its upward trajectory houses will be more like 350-400k (they were 200k 5 years ago).

When I got into this job I was under the impression that I had a pretty good paying profession since I'm paid a lot more than most of my friends. Is my spending too high? Is there something I did not consider? Any advice is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6ceze/first_year_into_working_real_job_will_i_ever_be/,"A) Are you open to condos? I make the same income as you and will be buying a condo in about 3 years. 

B) you could consider a lower down payment. 20% is thrown around a lot but the avg house buyer actually only puts down 6%. If you can find an affordable house in monthly payment, you don’t need to wait 10 years. Yeah you got the special program but with good credit, you can get low interest anyway.In the exact same position and I often wonder the same. What bothers me even more is for 300k you get something that is very small and/or needs a lot of further investment to make nice. Even when you start looking at bigger places for kids etc, your looking 400k to 500k and even then it’s likely a middle row house. The only way I think you will get value for money is to move to the country and a little German village, but then you have the commute. Germany is expensive for housing full stop. The market is geared towards rentals, even the people who own the house you rent often rent another house for themselves to live in. The only conclusion I ever come to is family money or houses being handed down in families is how you own a house in Germany.",1611776006.0,2

I'm a little late to the game as far as getting a hang of finances. Up until now, I've lived off of waitressing tips and video gigs. It worked but it was basically treading water while larger debts grew under the surface. I deduct part of my rent for my home office and all business expenses.

Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5we68/i_am_27_and_just_started_my_first_real_job_i_have/,"Seconding the comments telling you to first and foremost read the [Prime Directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics). But to address a couple of your questions:

>How realistic are my goals?

They seem quite doable.

>Should I bother with ETF's because they're hands-off? Or skip this step because of my access to awesome research and invest in individual stocks?

Definitely stick with passive index funds (these can take the form of ETFs or mutual funds). Choosing individual stocks is a bit of a crapshoot and even seasoned investors rarely are able to do it well. No need to take on more risk like that. Diversification is king.

>On what platform should I be investing?

The main 3 brokerages recommended on this sub are Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab. They are known for good service and low-cost reliable index funds.

>I have a Robinhood account, but the interest rate is low. What earns the highest annual interest? What's the difference between a high interest rate or an account that pays dividends and is one better?

The stock market doesn't really have ""interest"" in that way. You invest by purchasing a stock (or ideally, a fund that contains or tracks many stocks), and its value hopefully goes up over time, allowing you to later sell for a profit. Stocks/funds do also provide dividends which is sort of functionally like interest, but the growth is the primary relevant aspect.

Robinhood is good for individual stocks (and they have some ETFs too), for example I have a small amount of money on there to invest in some stocks for fun, but my primary investments (e.g. retirement fund and larger long-term brokerage account) are in Vanguard.

>What percent of my income should I pay into my 401k and should I bother with a Roth IRA if I already have a 401k?

Flowchart/Prime Directive will answer this but general rule of thumb is save [edit: at least] 15% of your income for retirement. That's a very rough rule of thumb so you should budget and do some math to figure out where you want to end up. [example investment calculator](https://www.daveramsey.com/smartvestor/investment-calculator)

Roth IRA is good, would highly recommend. IRAs are more flexible than 401k, contributions can be withdrawn at any time without penalty, and the earnings are tax-free if you withdraw them after age 59.5, or in certain other exceptional cases.**General Advice:**

* Pay down debt. If your expenses are accurate, you should be able to pay off your $6k in debt in less than 3 months and your $35k in student loans in 2 years. Attack those as soon as you have $1000 in the bank or 1 month's expenses (whichever is greater). After debt is paid off, build a 3-6mo emergency fund.
* Invest to get matching 401k from your employer. Then max out ROTH IRA. Once ROTH is maxed ($6k per year), then you can add more to your 401k
   * Invest in a low-fee Index Fund (**NOT** indexed life insurance). Index Funds are usually linked to general portions of the stock market - for example, an S&P 500 Index Fund is linked to the S&P 500 performance. If the S&P 500 companies go up, your Index Fund goes up.
* Save for your goals - we can't tell you how to prioritize them as we aren't you.

&#x200B;

**Specific Advice:**

>Invest as much as I can to earn passive income

This is hard to do. The best thing is to make more than you spend and invest for the long term. Passive income isn't impossible, but usually means you have several million dollars to general the next million.

&#x200B;

>Pay off immediate debt

Do this right away, including student debt. If you are worried about your job right now (who isn't), take advantage of this 0% interest / no payment period. You can take what you would pay and put it into a savings account. When payments are required, use this new account to make lump sum payment or stretch it out over multiple payments.

&#x200B;

>Begin saving/earning for retirement/house/etc

Savings for retirement should start **RIGHT NOW**. You need the benefits of starting young. Most people regret not saving in their 20s when they had the chance. The difference between starting at 27 and starting at 35 could be hundreds of thousands of dollars by the time you're 65. 

Once you are debt free, get a 3-6 month savings in a non-retirement account. If your job is at risk, go for 6 months. If it's safe, go for 3 months. If you don't know, go for 6.

&#x200B;

>Afford a bigger place

Your costs are low. I would bear it until your student loans are paid off (estimate 2 years or less). Once those are done, determine your priority - is getting a house higher priority than getting a bigger apartment? If so, suffer in the short-term to reap the gains of the long-term - i.e. you can save a lot of $$ by only paying $550 in rent. That gets you into a house faster than paying $1,000 in rent.

&#x200B;

>Network with the many successful people this job puts me in contact with

Easy to do. Create a LinkedIn profile (if you don't have one) and be open with your boss and all your co-workers. Don't make enemies. Don't spread gossip. Volunteer for travel trainings or other events where you can network. Not really PF related, though.

&#x200B;

>Grow my wealth

See above / other answers

&#x200B;

>Retire at reasonable (if not early) age and focus on my personal passions/business ventures

This is a simple calculus - make more than you spend. It's easier with a partner (Dual Income) and no kids (DINK). Watch for lifestyle creep (do you really need the Xbox Series X when you haven't finished the games on your Xbox One?). 

Depending on your retirement lifestyle, you need 25x - 30x your expected annual expenses. For example, if you expect to spend $100,000 per year in retirement, you should have between $2.5 - $3 million in a retirement account when you retire. Again, this will depend on your lifestyle, so travelling will require more and staying at home working on a garden will require less.

&#x200B;

>10-15 years down the line: no more college debt? (Not my top priority)

I'd make it a higher priority

&#x200B;

>20 years: help my parents out

Start thinking about this with your other goals in mind. For instance, do you think they will need to live with you? If so, will you need extra bedrooms in the house you're saving for? Will you need a bigger yard or space for parking extra cars? What about a casita in the back or a mother-in-law suite? A lot of new builds are offering ""home-within-a-home"" as they realize multiple generations are living in a single house. Just keep your parents in mind as you (and they) age.

&#x200B;

>Should I bother with ETF's because they're hands-off? Or skip this step because of my access to awesome research and invest in individual stocks? 

ETFs and Index Funds. They are cheap and (based on the last 100 years) will make you money over the long term investment cycle. For every person who makes $1mil on ""awesome research"" there are 100 people who lost everything. Depending on your risk tolerance, you can take that gamble. 

I'm risk averse, so I sold my 10 $GME shares at $7, making about $25. I lost out on the potential of $2000, *but I didn't lose money*, so I'm ok with my decision. No one could have predicted $GME would have gone from $2 to $200 in less than a year - not even that ""awesome research."" And no one could have predicted that stocks would have dropped by 30% in March of 2020 and then rebound so quickly. Truth really is stranger than fiction.

&#x200B;

> On what platform should I be investing? 

What ever one you are comfortable with. I use Fidelity for Retirement and Robinhood for my person ""fun money."" If you're comfortable with Schwab or TD Ameritrade or Etrade, use it. They are all basically the same at this point (with minor nuances here and there). Note that you might get better / different ETF or Index funds depending on which one you choose.

&#x200B;

>What percent of my income should I pay into my 401k and should I bother with a Roth IRA if I already have a 401k? 

As much as you can bear. If your employer offers a match, put at least that amount in - i.e. if the employer offers dollar-for-dollar match up to 4%, then put in at least 4%. 

It's not a bad idea to have both. 401k is pre-tax and will lower your overall tax burden. ROTH is post tax and you can take out your investments without being taxed if you have an emergency (unlike 401k). I split mine - I have a 401k, ROTH 401k and ROTH IRA. The 401ks both take directly out of my paycheck so they are easy to set-and-forget. When I find myself with extra cash (read: stimulus check) I put some of it towards my ROTH IRA.

This is getting to be a book. At the end of the day, there is a lot of good advice in the Wiki, and actual books that you can search for in this subreddit. None of them will answer all your questions (personal goals are, of course, personal), but you're on the right path. Even asking questions is better than 90% of the population, so keep looking for answers and you'll get there. Good luckYou need to pick one goal first, and then the rest can follow. I’d recommend an emergency fund first. Save up 3-6 months of expenses. 

If you already enough saved now, I’d tackle the student loan debt first. What’s the interest rate on the loan?Pay down your debt like your life depended on it.     Live like you are poor. Knock it all out in two or three years.

Once you have zero debt put  15% of income into tax deferred 401k.  Put it in broad retirement portfolio mostly made of mutual stocks. Roth IRA next if you like.  

Keep living like you are poor until you can put 6 months expenses into a savings account.

Congratulations on the job.  In a couple of years you will be in great shape.[removed]What is your ""other debt""?

My advice to you would be to put into retirement up to what your employer matches. Get your expenses as low as you can, and hammer out all of your debt. All $36,000. 

Making $80k yr and keeping your expenses minimal based on what you provided above that would take about a year, maybe 12-14 months. 

Then I would start putting 15% of your gross year income away in retirement accounts. Then look at your budget, what do you have remaining to put towards home savings? figure that out and see if you can add even more to retirement.

I would get rid of the debt as if your life depended on it and then move on from there. Because if frees you of that risk and that monthly burden so you can be putting even more towards your long term goals and growing your wealth instead of someone else's. 

That 12 month time frame not investing more is going to do virtually nothing to change your long term wealth building potential. But taken 10-15 years to pay off student loans is more than likely going to screw with your psychologically to make you feel like you are fighting an uphill battle and that will impact how aggressively you work towards you goals.Just to add as something to keep in mind, there are a LOT of unexpected costs that I never considered until I was paying my bills and wondering where all my money was going. I budgeted the same expenses you did and thought I would have about $2000 left over each month for saving and investing and it ended up typically being about half of that.

Things I didn't consider but are very typical and add up quickly: cell phone, internet, car maintenance (oil and filter changes mostly), toiletries and cleaning products, do you have a pet? vacation/entertainment, netflix, other streaming or media subscriptions, gas, ""mad money"" meaning cash you spend on things because you want them and help keep you from losing your mind saving every penny and never affording yourself something nice.

It's very easy to add up $500+ from the above things and not realize it because by themselves they're all fairly cheap but together they're expensive. You might not need TP or toothpaste or deodorant that often but when you do it costs a few bucks or more depending on what kind you buy and that usually adds a few dollars a month to your expenses you didn't account for.You've gotten some good advice so far OP. I'm in a similar age bracket, so I'd just like to point out that you've got a couple good advantages going.

* Expenses are low (keep this up as long as you can)
* You've got a long term view
* You're ambitious with respect to your career.

Pre-tax 401k contributions will help lower your tax burden, Roth IRA will lower your future tax burden (growth is tax free!). You should be able to max both of those (possibly after eliminating debt).

The most important aspect of long term wealth building is saving's rate and consistency of saving. My grandma says it like this: ""make savings a bill"".

The other thing you're gonna have to figure out is how your financial goals intersect with family planning. For example, if you want kids then an income disruption, savings disruption, and extra savings for a house become a lot more probable than if you're gonna live by yourself / with your boyfriend.

Another thing- might be worth mapping out what future support for your parents looks like, and if you expect to have a spouse or kids as part of your life plan, how they mesh with it.

Final thing, finances are only part of life. Sometimes the best decisions are not the financially optimal ones. For example, your debt to your bf might not carry interest, but for the sake of lifestyle it's probably worth paying that off to avoid future resentment.For retiring early you may want to save upwards of 50-80% of your income if at all possible. It’s real and doable. For stock market advice something to remember nobody knows for sure what is gonna happen, nor should you take financial advice from Reddit. Always do your own research into what it is. If you just simply don’t want to, then that’s fine. Just throw it into an etf and don’t even think about it. If you’re wanting specific ETFs, there’s SPY, VTI, any of the ARK’s. I just always recommend people to do their own DD (due diligence) and to take what everyone else says with a grain of saltHow realistic are my goals? Yes, all seem reasonable.

The only one I would question is ""Afford a bigger place"". If its just you at the moment and you are living just fine, why get a bigger place that is likely more in rent? It does't seem to jive with the rest of you goals.

\- What should I be working towards (career-wise, budgeting-wise) to achieve my goals?

Investing is the best thing possible. The power of compound can't be overstated, the longer you have money invested, the better off you'll be. As for budgeting, I'll say this, don't change your lifestyle too much because now you have more money. You were able to live with your previous salary, its no different now. Again, investing is your best friend, don't waste money on fancy cars, bigger apartments\\house\\ or a new iphone, you don't need it. If you want to achieve the goals you laid out, then don't try to keep up with everyone else because in reality, by investing your money instead, people are trying to keep up with you.

&#x200B;

\- Even though I work for an investment research company, I really don't know much about investing (I do media content). Should I bother with ETF's because they're hands-off? Or skip this step because of my access to awesome research and invest in individual stocks? Or are ETF's still the more safe, cost effective way to move forward?

ETFs and mutual funds are always the safe choice. This way you're not putting all your eggs in one basket. Still make sure that you invest in funds that have stocks in different sectors. If you choose all technology mutual funds for example, you aren't reducing your risk that much as they likely share the same stocks. Diversity is key. If you want to allocate 5%-10% of your investments toward stocks that is usual relatively safe as well.

Another big thought for investing is don't panic, ever. Keep everything long term, there are going to be bumps in the road. Some small, some feel gigantic. Don't sell, in fact, when the market is down, invest more, you're buying at a discount. It might take 2,4,10 years to pay off, but it will.

&#x200B;

\- On what platform should I be investing? I have a Robinhood account, but the interest rate is low. What earns the highest annual interest? What's the difference between a high interest rate or an account that pays dividends and is one better?

Don't rely on High-yield savings accounts in any way, they don't keep up with inflation and actually hurt your buying power. As for brokerage accounts, Robinhood is still not my favorite. There are plenty of more well established ones like etrade, schwab, vangaurd etc.

\- What percent of my income should I pay into my 401k and should I bother with a Roth IRA if I already have a 401k? got a lot going on here, I'll try to break down my thoughts as best I can.

Here's where it gets a little tricky. You say you want to retire early. Well, if you pumped everything into a 401k, you're locked in until 59 1/2. Take advantage of you company's matching, if there is any, then the rest is up to you. I personally only put about 7% because I too don't plan on working until 60 so I put my money in traditional accounts. You miss out on some tax advantages, but to me, the benefit of it being my money when I want it outweighs those.

31,Dealing with my deceased dad's medical debt from a hospital he shouldn't have been taken to,"I've browsed this subreddit and the debt collections wiki and haven't really seen a situation similar to this one, so I'm hoping you guys can help me out.

Long story short, my dad was a 100% disabled veteran and received free medical treatment from the VA. In 2016 he was in a car accident and he told the EMTs he needed to go to the VA, but instead they took him to a local hospital. He was there for a few hours before they transferred him, but that hospital said he owed them $15,000 and the ambulance service is claiming $1,100. He refused to pay them and said ""they can pry it from my cold, dead hands."" Well, he died in July from Covid and I've just been named the Administrator of his estate, so now it's my problem to deal with. 

The bills have been sent to collections of course, but is there any way I can fight the debt since the ambulance took him to the other hospital instead of the VA?

I'm pretty sure I've read from other posts on here that it's better for me to deal with the debt collection agency instead of the hospital and emergency services. Is that correct?

What would be a likely amount the debt collectors would settle for? Both bills were sent to the same company the total is a little over $20,000 after interest.

What is my best course of action?

403b: $19,375

1) Am I over contributing to my retirement accounts? 
2) I am expected to have a side-job within a month or 2 that will bring in an extra $1,600 a month. I will save a portion of this, probably $600 but the rest I would like to invest. Do you have any suggestions?

Plus if you decide to retire early your future self will thank you. 2) you could just keep all your side hustle money to go toward your down payment but otherwise just open a brokerage account and buy index funds.",1611773092.0,2
35,How do federal government pensions factor into retirement strategies?,"Hi all,

I (age 31) have been in the intelligence community since 2013 and I intend on staying in it until retirement.  The only way I can see myself leaving is if I am laid off or fired (basically impossible), or *maybe* to move into the private sector if the pay is a lot more.  In any event my position deals mostly with cyber and digital forensics so I'm not concerned from a job security standpoint.

I conservatively estimate that my gross pension when I retire at age 62 will be around $3,326 per month for life ($864 per month if I were to retire now).  I know I shouldn't rely on social security since that is no guarantee, but I feel like I can count on my pension (could be wrong).

How should this factor into my retirement strategy?

1. My Thrift Savings Plan allocation is currently 50% C, 15% S and 35% I.  Would keeping it at 100% stocks even while in retirement make sense since my pension will fulfill the purpose of bonds anyway?
2. I know the /r/personalfinance flowchart recommends that at least 15% of my gross income should go toward retirement, but I'm currently doing 10% and it appears to be plenty.  At age 62 assuming an average 7% rate of return I should have around $2.5 million plus my pension.  I know more can't hurt, but unless I'm missing something it seems like I can just consider another 5% optional.

Thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l65gp4/how_do_federal_government_pensions_factor_into/,"Best way to do this is start at the expense side and work backwards.

You have to take some guesses about what you think your retired life will be like and how you want it to be. 

What I mean by that is thinking about things like: ""will I be 10 years into a 30 year mortgage that I plan to stay in till I die, or I plan to sell the big suburban house and move to a cabin in the woods and net 200k into savings."" ""will my kids be grown and in there 30s or did I some how end up with a baby at 50 or will I be taking care of my elderly parents. Do I plan to sit on the couch and watch soap operas all day or spend 6 months a year traveling the world and the other 6 months racing vintage Porsches.""

The idea is to get a rough idea of your annual expense load. Do all of this in 2021 dollars its much easier that way. 

Then if you know you'll need 30k a year or 300k a year you can figure out how you get to that number. 

Doesn't really matter if it comes from a pension, ss, 401k, cash buried in the backyard, or a rich 22 year old boy/girlfriend. 

Then you can see how close or far apart those numbers are and plan accordingly. Save more, save less, plan on racing Hondas instead or Porsches, start looking for the rich girlfriend whatever. 

In the end rules of thumb are just that and you have to look at your own situation and goals. 

If you use the 4% rule the 2.5m should easily put out about 100k a year on its own. Combine with pension and SS and it sounds like you are well set up for at least a comfortable if not very comfortable retirement.If you haven't already, take a look at /r/govfire

* Typically when you are considering early retirement, you want to have 25 times your annual expenses.  Rather than calculating your pension into your net worth, you should just subtract it from your annual expenses.  Rough example:  Your annual expenses are 50,000 but your pension will be 23,000 - you need to make up 27,000 which means you want to have roughly 675,000
* If you are eligible, you can maintain your Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) for life into retirement.  This too should just be subtracted from your annual expense calculation
* With regards to TSP all stocks:  I wouldn't do it that way but I guess you could.  It's a whole lot easier to just deduct your pension from your annual expenses and then follow conventional wisdom on the difference
* As far as ""how much should I be saving"":  15% to me is the same thing as the recommended daily allowance of calories is 2000.  That's insane because it is the average height, weight and physical activity of a large population where individual calorie needs will be VERY different than 2000.  You should be tracking your expenses with an eye to the future (increasing medical costs, more leisure times often means more expense vacations, etc.).  Figure out how much you need and save for that.>How should this factor into my retirement strategy?

You calculate your income needs in retirement, subtract out your expected pension, and then back into a total amount needed for retirement.  

So if you earn $40k/year on your pension, that's (40k/.04 = $1,000,000) less you'd need to have saved in your TSP/401k/IRAs

If you want an $80k income in retirement then, you'd need to save $1MM or so.You may find these links helpful:

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/personalfinance) if you have any questions or concerns.*Regarding #1:  I plan on being less conservative with my fund distribution as I age.  To me, the pension does take up some of the utility of F or G fund allocations. This does not mean 100% stocks as a 60 yo...but I will be less conservative than standard guidance.How on earth does that work.  Even if your high-3 was maxed out at SES you've only got 7 years in.   Did you get prior service credit to bring you up to 30?Weird that you count Fers but not SS they come from the same place. The breakdown is supposed to look like 80% Of your salary when you retire with 1/3 from fers 1/3 from tsp (401k for you non feds) and 1/3 from SS. The only level you can pull there is TSP. So if you make 100k now and do the minimums you'd have 80k if you retired tomorrow. If you want more than 80k you increase your TSP contributions.I don’t factor pension in currently because there have been rumblings about weakening or eliminating the pension for younger workers (you wouldn’t necessarily be grandfathered in even if you’re a already a civil servant). I currently max out tsp and a Roth IRA. This is an interesting thread though! I may reevaluate my strategy.I honestly (29M) do not factor it in at all. It's just icing on the cake, but I save as much as I feel I need to outside of that pension. 

Because the chances of your staying in your job for 30 years not only sounds nauseating but its highly unlikely. So don't paint yourself in a corner where you don't feel you can leave your job because you need the pension and now you are unhappy and miserable. 

What I do, do when it comes to retirement planning is I do factor in that my pension money is retirement money. So I factor that into my 15% going to retirement funds, and then maybe allocate part of my 15% to non retirement accounts. 

You should be investing 15% of your income regardless IMO, that doesn't mean it has to be in retirement accounts. 

Another thing to factor in is, are you doing Roth investing in your TSP? If you are going to be getting a very decent amount of pension and SS money in retirement, then you probably want the majority of your retirement money in Roth otherwise you risk your income going up in retirement and your tax burden will be higher. So think about that too. 

In short, I do not factor my benefits into how much I invest, I only factor it into WHERE I invest.",1611757265.0,4

39,Estate planning-how to best set up to allow one heir to buy out the other and maintain the current home,"I have a significant disability and live in an extremely expensive part of the country so my partner and I have been sharing a property with my parents, who we pay rent to and assist with various things. The property was specifically left to my mom by her elderly, childless friend so my mom and I would always have a place to live. In the past my sister told my parents that she did not care about inheriting the house and I was not too worried because I thought I was going to be able to work full time, albeit taking a little longer to finish college than I had planned. 

Well of course life changes. My physical abilities declined, partially due to the lack of medical care when I transitioned from pediatrics to adult medicine. My partner had some health issues that impacted his career trajectory. My sister, who is much older than me and not very close emotionally to myself or my parents, has decided she does want a portion of the house and won’t work with me  so I can keep it when the time comes.  

Currently the house/property is part of a trust and I am the executor. I would inherit 75% of the property plus all contents (of course allowing my sister and nephew to choose sentimental items they want) and 50% of any life insurance money that is left (my parents have relatively small life insurance policies). The house has a $180,000 mortgage with a very good interest rate.  Stipulated in the trust is that I have 6 months to decide if I want to keep the home or sell it and am able to use the money in the bank account to make payments during that time. I am not counting on the life insurance being available for my sister or I as it may have to be cashed out to pay for my parent’s care as they get older (as far as I understand their policies have cash value that can be taken out). 

I would like to keep the property when my parents pass. I have a deep emotional attachment here and moving would disrupt my medical care and in home supports as well as my entire support system. I have already been told my sister does not intend to help with my parents’ care as they get older (that will be entirely on me and my partner and I can’t do much physically) and I already need to be available to help them with financial issues and healthcare. They would like to set up the trust so that my sister gets something but in a way that would realistically allow me to pay her off. They are afraid if they don’t leave her part of the house she would cut me off entirely from my nephew. Currently my income is only SSDI and my partner’s income, which is modest but will hopefully increase once he finishes his degree. We are unable to marry because I would lose my health insurance. We would have enough to pay the current mortgage payment and our living expenses but not a much extra. The property currently has a renter living in a trailer and I could use that money to pay my sister or pay a loan to pay my sister. 

I guess my questions are:is there a specific way to set this up so my sister does get a benefit but can’t force me out of the home if I can’t come up with her 25% (almost $200,000 right now)? If I inherit 75% of the house can she force me to sell to get her 25%? Could I choose to just send her a monthly payment towards her portion instead of getting a loan if I can not qualify/afford a loan? Could I refinance the current loan to also cover her 25%? I know that there are provisions to allow related heirs to assume the loan on a mortgaged property without meeting financial requirements. Who would I even talk to to get this information? 

My parents rely on me to get this sort of information and get very stressed/have a hard time understanding the info if they have to find it themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6es77/estate_planninghow_to_best_set_up_to_allow_one/,,1611782874.0,1
40,Roth IRA over contribution back in 2018,"Hi all, I was going over my previous years tax returns and found out I may have over contributed to my  Roth IRAs because of MAGI.

MAGI = $125163

2018 Vanguard Roth IRA Contribution: $5500

2018 Employer 401k Roth Contribution: $205

2019/2020/2021 Vanguard Roth IRAs are also maxed out but MAGI is much lower so no overcontribution issues in these years.

Based on this [p590a--**2018**.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p590a--2018.pdf) Worksheet 2-2, I figured my reduced contribution limit is $3607, so my excess is $1893.For line **9 Enter contributions to other IRA** do I include the Employer 401k contribution or should I not include it to figure out the max I can contribute? Is this the correct worksheet or should I use [p590a--**2019**.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p590a--2019.pdf)?

I would like to know how to fix it (e.g. what forms I need to file this year, whether I have to withdraw contributions/earnings). Should I also withdraw some contribution from 2020/2021 to avoid some penalties?

Side note:  I filed via Credit Karma and they did not catch this. Anyone using Credit Karma see them catching this? Which tax software catches this kind of thing automatically?

41,Rate my updated budget,"Wife finally finished college and started her new job, a teacher so it isn't great money, but still more than retail. I got a new job that paid 30% more. So now that the new year hit, I wanted to get some insight on my budget.

&#x200B;

Income takehome: 5600/mo from me and 2200 from wife.

Investments: I full match my 401K - 8 percent of my income for 6 percent match. Wife gets pension plus a small amount of 401K. We currently dont put any EXTRA towards any IRA or other investments.

Bills - home: 1400/mo barely refinanced last year when rates dropped, so 29.5 years remaining

car1: 600 month honda accord - only 12K remaining, only 30K miles on it.

car2: 700 month toyota 4runner - 30K remaining, just hit 10K miles. (We had a paid off hyundai accent, but I hit a deer and totalled it, otherwise we weren't going to get another car until the honda was paid off)

insurance: 120/mo

petrol: 150-200/mo

HOA/sewer/garbage: 100/mo

gas/power:150/mo

Groceries: 500/mo feeding me/wife/one kid

medical: 200 (150 chiropractor, 50 to baby doctor) - these are upfront payments to keep balances at 0.

Fun: 500-1000 

Phone: 200 (2 ipad lines, 2 phone lines)

&#x200B;

Credit cards: (I know these are high, but we used them to get my wife through college, so it should pay off eventually) All CCs are within like 1-2 percent interest of each other

Amex: 20K balance - 600 payment, 300 goes to interest

Citi - 10K balance - 300 payment, 150 to interest

Local Credit Union - 10K balance - 300 payment, 150 interest

&#x200B;

Adding all these up I get about 6000 outgoing and 7800 incoming. I am using about 1000 extra each month for getting credit card payments down (I was at 50K in cc's last July), and the remainder we use for things like christmas and vacations. 

&#x200B;

I know I could cut out the extra spending, and pay off credit cards faster, but is it really worth the morale hit to pay it off maybe 1 year earlier?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6eq6v/rate_my_updated_budget/,,1611782706.0,1

heh, somewhat humourous auto-correct.

But to answer your question, call up the lender, inform them of your mistake, let them know that you've already paid the bill, and just make sure that there are no interest charges that will be made as a result.  If there are, let them know this is your first time missing a payment and ask for a one time waiver.  If they decline, hang up and call again until you get a customer service rep who can help you.Nobody reputable reports late payments to credit reporting agencies unless they are 30+ days late.

Give them a call.  They will probably waive the late fee if it's your first offense.just call them and ask them to remove it and not report. you'll most likely get a free pass on this, just don't do it again! :)You may find these links helpful:

53,"Wife and I made some mistakes last year and ended up owing just shy of $5000 in taxes for 2020, did we cover our bases for next year?","Hi personalfinance, I'm a long-time follower of the subreddit and tonight I've found myself in a spot to finally ask for some advice. I apologize for the length of this post in advance, but if you manage to bear with me and have any advice or commentary, I am very thankful.

My spouse and I filed our taxes tonight and discovered that we owed a lot more than we expected, about $5000. Yes, we filed very early, but we have all of our documents and do not have a complicated tax situation so we just got it done.

* We live in California
* We do not have kids
* We do not own a home
* We do not have any investments beyond each employer-provided 401k and a Roth IRA that we did not contribute to last year
* We have a higher-yield savings account that generated about $300 in interest
* We paid a few hundred dollars of interest in student loans due to the COVID-19 deferment
* We are shooting for $0 owed and a $0 return

The reason I say ""expected"" is because we did discover that we were in a pickle a bit past halfway through 2020.

## Federal Taxes

For most of last year I was making about $75k as an hourly employee working 4 days a week at 10 hours per day. I started working in that role in November 2019. Not long after starting I noticed that I was receiving 8 hours of regular pay and 2 hours of overtime (1.5x) each day, in addition to full days of holiday pay that fell on days I was not scheduled to work otherwise. Instead of thinking harder about this, I thought that was cool and enjoyed it; my spouse expressed that they didn't think that was normal but took my word for it to not worry (I know). Later on in the year I was called into a meeting with about 4 other coworkers in the same situation and my manager told us that this was not intended, but the company would not be asking for any repayment and that we should expect future paychecks to be decreased to their intended amounts. I was grateful that they didn't ask me to write them a check but naturally was concerned about my tax situation; I used the IRS withholding calculator for 2020 and it determined that to shoot for $0 owed, I should withhold an additional ~$230 per paycheck and my spouse should withhold an additional ~$100 per paycheck in federal taxes (amounts estimated based on my memory). Great, I modified our W4s and added that in. I do not recall what we were additionally withholding prior to this correction but I do know that we were shooting for $0 owed/returned. (EDIT: I'm realizing that we probably were not withholding anything additional prior to this, because I wouldn't have the same question that I detailed at the end of the post. We were probably just withholding whatever is automatically withheld by our employers.)

Then, in December 2020, I started a new job making $110k, plus a yearly 10% bonus, with a $10k signing bonus that was supposed to be paid out 90 days after starting. I figured that since I started in December and would receive 1.5 paychecks before the end of the year, I wouldn't bother using the calculator to create an accurate W4 and just submitted an unchanged W4 with no additional withholding. In my mind, whatever I owed would be minor given that I *should* have fixed most of my unpaid tax burden by increasing withholding at my former employer. My spouse did not change their withholding and continued to withhold ~$100 for the last month of 2020.

My signing bonus was unexpectedly paid out a few weeks into the new job and naturally fell into my 2020 income. Taxes were withheld from this (22% for federal, which agrees with what I read elsewhere online about how much bonuses are taxed, as well as other applicable taxes). I am unsure if this had an effect on how much we ended up owing in federal taxes, but my hunch is that it did.

Our federal taxes owed has come out to **$2235**, much higher than I expected given the adjustments that we made to our W4s to compensate for my stupidity.

## State Taxes

After the shock that we were in because of our federal tax situation, we were dismayed to discover that we owe **$2628** to the state of California in unpaid taxes. I had no idea where this came from as we followed California's DE-4 instructions very closely:

* I took 2 standard allowances for the both of us with no additional withholding
* My spouse took 0 allowances with no additional withholding

We discovered that my spouse paid $5 in California income tax for the entirety of 2020. Unbeknownst to both of us, the checkbox on their DE-4 stating that they are exempt from state income tax was checked since January of 2020. We can only conclude that while we were filling out the W4 when their company switched payroll systems that month, we weren't paying attention and checked that box. My spouse made $26.55 hourly for most of 2020 and then began making $65k salary in October 2020. No federal or state withholding adjustments were made with the new pay rate so they were still withholding the additional ~$100 federal per paycheck that was calculated to fix my own mistake described previously.

This was a mistake on both of our parts, a big one at that. We should have noticed this much sooner. We have corrected the problem now and they have only received 2 paychecks this month that have no state income tax withheld.

## Where We Are Now

* We filed our taxes and are set to pay back what we owe. Based on the issues mentioned above, I have no reason to believe that the numbers are incorrect. We have a substantial emergency fund and will be fine shouldering this burden, though it may take a bit for the embarrassment to wear off. Payments have been scheduled for the new tax season start date of February 12 2021.
* We fixed the California DE-4 exemption checkbox, as mentioned.

Earlier this month I used the IRS withholding calculator with the first paycheck that we each received for 2021 to determine what our federal withholding should be to achieve $0 owed/returned. It determined that I should be withholding $208 additional per paycheck (up from the $0 that I withheld after transitioning to my new job but down from the ~$230 I was withholding at my old job), and that my spouse should withhold $73 additional per paycheck (down from the ~$100 that they were withholding). We both adjusted our W4s as such.

Tonight, after panicking at the unexpected owed taxes, I decided to go through the IRS withholding calculator again. Despite our increased withholding that we set based on the calculation from earlier this month, it estimates that we will **owe $2040** in federal taxes at the end of the year. To owe $0, it says to:

1. Set my additional withholding to $210
2. Set my spouse' additional withholding to $74

Next to both of these numbers, it says ""this is an amount of withholding over and above the standard withholding from each paycheck for this job if lines 3 through 4(c) of the Form W-4 were blank or zero."" At the moment, line 4(c) is not blank or zero since we are withholding the additional $208 and $73 respectively. Those numbers are suspiciously close to the earlier numbers that were returned.

So my questions are:

1. How much did the early bonus affect our tax burden?
2. When considering my expected yearly 10% bonus, on the IRS withholding calculator, am I correct to check the box that says ""My employer will withhold the appropriate taxes from this future bonus"" since I do see that taxes are being withheld from my bonuses?
3. Do we add the $210 and $74 returned by the calculator onto the additional withholding that we are already doing since the beginning of the month, effectively doubling our additional withholding? Am I interpreting and using this calculator correctly?
4. How do we correct our state withholding for the two paychecks that my spouse has received this year with $0 state income tax withheld? Just take a guess at an additional amount of state withholding on a new DE-4?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5ymtv/wife_and_i_made_some_mistakes_last_year_and_ended/,"The easiest way to avoid underpayment penalties is to make quarterly estimated tax payments that meet the safe harbor amount, either 100% or 110% of previous years tax obligation, depending on AGI (and assuming you are not a farmer or fisherman).  If you have withholding, then you need to coordinate between withholding and estimated payments.Regarding the withholding calculator, I've heard issues with the calculator when you use the separate bonus function. It's better to just include it in your annual salary amount.

It's hard to follow what happened, what with your changing jobs and you admitting that there were errors on your withholding forms. So what's the situation now? What are your salaries now, and how are the forms filled out now?

It's also impossible to verify whether the amounts you owe are accurate, but I'll assume the amounts owed are correct. Since your bonus had tax withheld, that doesn't seem to be at the heart of your issue now.I would also suggest you get in the habit of rerunning and resubmitting your w4 mid year.  Good way to insure you're still on track.Along with resubmitting throughout the year, at first glance, the extra withholding seems low (I just did this).

If you use the two jobs worksheet on the W4, and are paid biweekly, you should have $450 in 4(c). This is not including the bonus.",1611730623.0,15
54,"I gave my SSN away to a scammer, now what?","So this morning I woke up to a text from one of those Real ID phishing scam text messages: ""AZ-DOT Your Driver's License required to meet with our new regulation-compliant update.Visit: (link)"". This was all perfect timing as I was already expecting something important from the DMV about my license. So, in my groggy, worried state, I mindlessly clicked on the link, entered my name, address, social and email into the website and clicked submit. It was in that moment I realized what I had just done. 

What I did: After having the freak out of my life, I promptly called the FTC to file a report that my information had been compromised. Then I called the 3 major credit unions to freeze my credit. Lastly I changed my passwords. 

What I tried to do: I called the police department to file a report, but since a crime has not been committed yet, there was nothing to report. I also called the IRS, and likewise, since a crime has not been committed there's nothing they could do. 

To my knowledge, these are all the steps I can take. 
But who knows if I'm forgetting a crucial step here. I was about to finance a truck, so this couldn't happen at a worse time. 

So here are my questions: 
Have I done everything I can? How long should I keep fraud alerts for my accounts once I unfreeze them? How often do you have to renew these fraud alerts? How long will this affect me, and will I have to live the rest of my life worried that someone is waiting to use my SSN? What else should I look out for moving forward (financing a car, opening an account, buying a house, etc)?

I'm in my mid 20s, and ignorant regarding most things finance, so any info about this is appreciated.

Sounds like you've done what you can on your end to freeze your credit.   Now you need to get in the habit of monitoring it.  

>How long should I keep fraud alerts for my accounts once I unfreeze them?

No reason to unfreeze them unless you plan on applying for credit.   You would want to freeze them again after getting approved for whatever credit / loan you're looking for.   

>How long will this affect me, and will I have to live the rest of my life worried that someone is waiting to use my SSN?

As the other commenter mentions pretty much everyone's SSN # has been compromised.  I wouldn't go through life worried, but make the necessary steps to protect yourself.  Try to do better about protecting yourself against scams and phishing attempts.  

>What else should I look out for moving forward (financing a car, opening an account, buying a house, etc)?

58,Cost of Living Calculators,"I am trying to make sense of comparing salaries between a very low cost of living city and a much higher cost of living city. I’m hoping that someone has advice since the numbers seem odd. It seems that the calculators available vary quite a bit, but most give an equivalency for about $70,000 in salary in the cheap city to be about $120,000 in the new city. 

What confuses me about this is that I’m single, with no kids, and pretty frugal so I can live comfortably in the cheaper city on something like $25,000 per year. Multiplying that $25,000 by the 1.7 multiple gives a new (actually spent) cost of living of $42,500. So what’s interesting here is that looking at it this way would mean that in the cheaper city my savings (after paying for living) would be $70,000-$25,000 = $45,000 per year while the more expensive city would give a savings of $77,500.

That seems to show that the more expensive city is actually much better for someone who doesn’t have an expensive lifestyle since the savings rate is so much higher. Does anyone have personal experience with something like this to be able to tell me whether I’m missing something? Why don’t the cost of living calculators account for the portion of your salary that you actually use?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l625kf/cost_of_living_calculators/,"The cost of living calculators mostly assume that you are spending your entire salary. They use income as an approximation for costs. You are trying to compare actual costs - which means you’ll want to use the deltas for each category based on your current expenses. 

Housing and commute are the big things to consider in a bigger city in reality. 

Good luck!Don't forget to figure tax brackets into your math. The first $12,000 you make is taxed much less than the next $12,000, and so on. You'll still see an increase in savings, but taxes will eat away some of it.You may be interested in our [Tools wiki](/r/personalfinance/wiki/tools).

If you sell a stock for a profit, but don't withdraw the gains from your brokerage account, do you still owe taxes on it? Can gains  be reinvested without being taxed, or are you taxed on all gains regardless of if you withdraw them from your brokerage account?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6duhw/beginner_question_on_capital_gains_taxes/,"> If you sell a stock for a profit, but don't withdraw the gains from your brokerage account, do you still owe taxes on it?

Yes

> Can gains be reinvested without being taxed

No

> are you taxed on all gains regardless of if you withdraw them from your brokerage account?

Yes.

The second your sell order executes, you owe taxes on the gains. The IRS doesn't care what you do with the proceeds after that.The sale is a taxable event whether or not you withdraw, reinvest, or do anything else with the money.yes, no, yes.

When you sell an asset for more than you purchased it for you will have capital gains.  If you held that asset for less than a year the capital gains are considered short term and will be taxed at your normal rate (ie it's just added to your normal income as if you earned it from your job).  If you held the asset for longer than a year it is considered long term capital gains and is taxed at a preferential rate (it still counts as income, but is taxed at a lower rate than money earned from your job).

Both short and long term capital gains count as income in the year you made the sale, and will have to be reconciled when you complete your taxes for the year.  So if you sold an asset today and had capital gains, it will be reported for this year (2021) and you will have to include it as income when you complete your 2021 tax return in early 2022.  

It doesn't matter what you do with the capital gains after the sale, you still count it as income.  You can withdraw it, leave it in the brokerage, or reinvest it into another asset.  It doesn't matter, whatever the amount of the gain was will be recorded and reported as income.Only way to not pay tax on a gain is to have an offsetting loss. This is call Tax Loss Harvesting.

- moved to Texas before covid and moved back to Chicago in April due to working remote...
- didn’t know if I would have to go back or not, so I moved my items into storage unit. The items are about 5k worth of value and I bought them with my moving package
- I have 13k in personal savings, always around 8k in checking. And I would like to spend under 4K moving.

Jobs:
Chicago: 
- used to make 72k and 10% bonus, 4K sign on 
Texas: 
- current job, make 95k, 20% bonus (paid quarterly), 15k moving bonus, 4K sign on and pretty miserable and boring 
Opportunity: 
- not sure...definitely won’t have a bonus and salary will be less but I am saving so much at my current job that my take home is same as my previous salary🤷‍♀️ 


Questions:
- is it worth flying down to Texas and hiring two people for labor and using a shipping pod to move those belongings? I’ve estimated cost at $3000 for this 
- or do I fly down... pay to stay somewhere for a few days... deal with selling everything... ship 6+ boxes across the country of things I’m not selling...and re buy everything
- do I drive my car from Chicago to Seattle and fill that with my belongings that are in Chicago (3 suitcases and a box or 3)
- or pay to have my car shipped as well....

Now that it's time to sign the lease for another year, the roommate with the larger room wants to keep it as he is settled in the room and likes the space.

Naturally the rent should shift such that he pays more. I'm not experienced in this so I'm unsure how to fairly split rent. Assuming that the larger room is twice the size of the other two rooms. How should we split rent?

TIA",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6cam0/what_do_advisors_mean_by_living_off_of_mutual/,"The actual idea is that you build up some invested money, then gradually sell it off, letting asset growth offset the amount you're pulling out so that you don't run out of money. It's a perfectly sound idea.

However, that 12% number is garbage. It's higher than you can historically expect from stock investments, and it's definitely not a safe amount to withdraw if you need your money to last. A commonly accepted value for withdrawal rate is 4% of the initial principal (allowing for future inflation).

So DR is telling you the general truth but exaggerating it. My guess is that if you actually went deeper into DR's materials you would get more realistic info, and that the 12% is just an attention-grabbing headline.> But how would the guy actually get paid with this type of investment?

You sell some of it as you need money.12% is wildly high, long term the market historically yields 7%ish per year. So $100 in stocks today, on average, will be worth $107 a year from now. The idea is that you sell 4% a year - so you sell ~$4 worth of those stocks every year and live off the money. In that case, next year those stocks would be worth then $103 ($107-4). The next year you'd sell $4.16 worth of stocks and your account would now be worth $106.09. 


So it's just saying, have a lot of money in the stock market and sell some of those stocks every year. The total value should increase along with inflation, so you never deplete that nest egg.>It doesn’t provide dividends, 

Mutual funds absolutely provide dividends. In retirement you would live off a combination of dividends/coupon payments and withdrawals from principal. 

With a conservative enough withdrawal rate (4% is a baseline) you can rely on long term appreciation to outpace your withdrawals

12% isn't your withdrawal rate, its the accumulation rate, and 12% is on the high side, its probably closer to 7% after factoring inflation and of course its not guaranteed in any way.",1611775522.0,0

84,"How can I make use of my investments and withdraw/borrow, in case of emergency.","I am expected to close on a home purchase next month, using virtually all of my savings and a small 401k loan to cover down + closing costs.

For my next few paychecks prior to closing, I plan to significantly decrease my ESPP to bare minimum so its still actively enrolled and decrease my 401k contributions to the pre-tax minimum that takes advantage of the company match. This is so I can rebuild my savings as well as have some money to quickly payoff the 401k loan, which should give me about a $5k safety net by close of escrow.

**If I encounter a situation where I need money for any scenario (repairs, emergency, debt payments). I'd like to what I can do with these investments:**

* Former employer 401ks - $170k (75% in pre-tax / 25% in roth)
* Current employer 401k - $35k (but 15k loaned out per above)
* Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) - $30k 

Some options that I understood in this subreddit or from various friends:

1. Rollover those former 401ks to a Trad IRA and a ROTH IRA, then withdraw from ROTH IRA if I have to since I already paid tax.
2. Do same as 1, but also rollover some amount to the current 401k in case a 2nd loan is needed (our policy allows two active loans, from funds that are 50% vested). Since I'm at 50% now with the first loan, rolling over more into the current 401k will give me some buffer.
3. Sell the stocks from the ESPP ($30k non-tradeable). I have $20k that meets the holding period by June this year, and $10k June next year.

Another thing is that my parents have offered me about $20k as a gift for down + closing, but they are just barely a year into retirement and I said to hold on to their money until end of year so they can see how their situation plays out. If they are fine, gift me by 2022 which I'll use to pay off the 401k loan and keep the rest in safety net.

Over time though, despite paying my minimums, or full monthly payments, it has accumulated interest charges which is so high (30+%) that I am basically doubling my monthly payment just to break even for each month. It isn't a huge debt, only 1900.

I am ready to navigate this differently and either get a personal loan to pay it off, or transfer the debt to a more deserving/reasonable credit card with a long term 0% balance transfer APR and lower general APR rate. What is my best option that will benefit me to most ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6c6jc/is_it_better_to_transfer_cc_debt_to_new_cc_or/,"The option that would benefit you the most is to pay off the balance.

Why are you carrying $1900 around for so long?You don't need a 0% balance transfer or a personal loan. It's a relatively small balance, as you said, knock that out in a few months or less by 1) budgeting and cutting back on expenses.

>despite paying my minimums 

If you ever find yourself in a situation in which you are opting to only make a minimum payment, you need to use the CC less.The most important step here is to make the necessary changes to your budget and your mindset so that you stop using this card until the interest-accruing balance is cleared.  If you don't, then transferring this debt is likely only going to make things worse.

Mathematically speaking, the ""best"" options are, in order of savings:

1. Paying off the balance within one or two months
2. Transferring the balance to a 0% promo APR card and paying it off before the 0% rate expires
3. Personal loan/paying off the balance more slowly/another CC

However, transferring the balance comes with the added danger that you could very well run up the balance on both cards afterward.  So it's **really** important that you fix this issue before trying to transfer balances, because this is how debt spirals start.

If you can't get a 0% APR card, a personal loan with a lower rate \*might\* be a better deal, but it really depends on your budget and the offers you get.  The minor advantage of a personal loan over another CC is that you can't dig yourself further into debt by spending what you pay off on the loan, but that risk of spiraling is still there with your current card.Your solution would work if you actually stick to it. I think everyone is more concerned with your “self-discipline”. They don’t want you to open a new CC, which increases your total spending limit, only to run up both cards and put you back in the situation you are currently in, but with more debt.",1611775144.0,0

I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both?

The fact that both places suspended you around the same time is suggestive that some kind of alert went out connected to your account. Either from TDA to Schwab, or vice versa, or else they both reacted to some kind of alert from elsewhere.

Also, it's maybe a little odd that you opened both a TDA account & a Schwab account within days of each other. Did you put any money in the TDA account?

The money that you put into Schwab - was it from a bank account solely in your name? Did the transfer go through on the BoA side?When you call back and they say they need additional days, you should let them know you’ve already spoken previously and they said x days and now it’s been dragged on for about a month and that’s too long for them to be holding that amount of cash without letting you know what fraudulent activity they’re talking about.

88,How to approach paying for medical school,"I'm very fortunate to have earned a significant amount of money in the past two days from trading stocks which should allow me to pay off the entire four years of medical school on my own. Would it be better to use the cash I currently have on hand (\~350k USD) towards paying for medical school by the year, or would it be better to take out loans and keep all of the money invested in an index fund?

From what I understand, loans for medical school in the US accrue 6-7% interest every year which I believe would be more than offset by the yearly gains from letting my money sit in an index fund. I also haven't been able to find much information on the likelihood of having my loans frozen during residency, subsidized by my future employer, or forgiven entirely.

93,How do I find out if I have loans with Sallie Mae? Where do they appear?,"Hello everyone , im in a bit of a weird situation.

I know I had at least one loan through Sallie Mae back in 2013/2014 I'm fairly certain I paid this off, I used it to pay for college classes. I graduated end of 2019. 

Back when this loan was first taken out, I unfortunately, didn't have any control over my finances and my ex-boyfriend took it out for me, of course I signed the paperwork for it, but I didn't understand what I was doing. I'm trying to get my crap together and get to the bottom of this. 

I have been trying to get an account with Sallie Mae over their website to start paying off my loans or at least see what the situation was with them, I'm not able to make an account.

Although I've been advised against this, I ended up calling them to talk with a representative, she took down my information and still couldn't find anything on me, and also , she said I didn't have an account with them and she was unable to make me one.

She suggested I call National Student Loan Data System. I  did, couldn't talk to a representative, all I'm trying to do is find where my loan is with Sallie Mae, how much I owe or if I even have any at this point.

94,Help me sort my situation out / focus on saving (UK),"Hi all

I've been struggling with a gambling addiction for a long time and have recently lost around £60,000 which included all of my savings plus around £10k in debt.  I need to refocus to get past this and I think having a solid financial plan would really help with that.

**My circumstances**:

30s male, living with partner who owns her apartment.  Good job with lots of potential.  Mediocre credit rating.  Got rid of all my high limit credit cards (AMEX, MBNA, Barclaycard & an old Marbles card) around a year ago after gambling issues caused me to rack up a lot of debt on them.  2 missed payments around 9 months ago on ccs and higher than average number of credit (mainly high interest loans) taken out / repaid over the past few years but other than that everything else is ok.  High risk tolerance.

**Income**

£43250 pre tax per year (£2650 per month after tax) + a chunky bonus received at the end of March.  Amount TBC for this year but expecting around 35% (\~£15k) of annual salary.  Pension is company 15% me 4%, invested in high risk plan.

Also do freelance work for £50 per hour.  I'm aiming for 80 - 100 hours freelance a month at the moment given there is nothing else to do and I need to get myself back on track.  Assume the lower end of this, so £4000 / month.

2650 + \~4000

= \~£6500 per month  + the bonus coming at the end of March.

**Outgoings**

My core outgoings are relatively low:

\- £600/month rent + bills

\- £300 therapy (hopefully this will reduce soon but I need it for now)

\- £200 food

\- £100 misc (travel, subscriptions etc).

**Debt**

High interest loan with £6290 remaining balance, at £262 / month.  Only 1 month in of 2 years.  Amount to settle today would be £4404 so decent amount of money to be saved paying off early.

Short term loan with £2512 left to pay over 11 months at £228/month.  This one is even higher interest.

Capital one ccs x2 with £200 balance each

Zopa cc with £300 balance

Vanquis cc with £150 balance

I have been clearing all of these each month but intend to get rid of the Vanquis and one capital one, and keep zopa plus the other for shopping etc. to build my credit back up.

I also pay a family member £1k / month (no interest) to repay debt.

**Total Outgoings**

Core - £1200

Debt (not including ccs) -   £1490

= £2690

Can anyone help advise me what my plan should be going forward?

Including

\- what best to do with my bonus (I assume clear my debt)

\- how much I should aim to have in my bank account

\- what I should be investing in (previously tracker fund in stocks and shares isa)?

We keep ~ 40k in an ally account for emergency fund and have no consumer debt. 

We have good health insurance through my employer so no HSA

I wanted to start a savings/investment plan for my daughter but everything I read tells me I should be maxing out all Tax differed retirement accounts before I consider Saving or investing in anything else and currently I’m not maxing out any.

But if that money is not in a 529 then it doesn't make any difference whether it's in a fund ""for her"" or for you and your family. You can just gift her your money whenever you want.

Some specific thoughts on your situation, though:

* You should always start by working towards your post-60 retirement. Even if you want some money early, you shouldn't prioritize that until you've actually completed saving enough to cover you from age 60 onwards, and that is best done through tax advantaged accounts. Once you have your regular retirement fully funded, pivot to early retirement saving.
* For your daughter - I would recommend first prioritizing your own future. You can always help her out later if you're in position to. Before just saving up general money, I would set aside money for education in a 529.
* Don't prioritize investments to generate present-day income unless you need it. Prioritize long-term growth until you're closer to actually needing income.",1611772624.0,1
