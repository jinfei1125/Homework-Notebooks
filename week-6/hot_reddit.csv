Last March, we posted a [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fhrfqo/coronavirus_megathread_resources_discussion_and/) with tons of information about Coronavirus-related issues, and in September a [second megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) was posted with additional information on updates to payroll tax deferrals, student loan interest waiver, and unemployment. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic and recent U.S. governmental actions, we are posting a third installment of this megathread. **Please keep in mind that politics and political discussions are still not allowed here.**

# Stimulus Payments (updated Jan 5, 2021)

For the second round of stimulus payments: For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $600 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $1,200 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. For head-of-household filers, it is $600 if your AGI is below $112,500. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $600 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

As with the first stimulus - If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, your payment will be reduced by 5% of the difference between your AGI and the income threshold. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $600 is completely phased out once your income hits $87,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $2,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $174,000.

The [Get My Payment portal](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) has been updated to include information regarding the second stimulus. This is the first place you should check for the status of your stimulus payment. The IRS released a [statement](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-statement-about-economic-impact-payments) about the status you are seeing on the GMP portal for second stimulus payments:

* If there is a deposit date and account information, this is where your payment will be deposited.

* If there is mailing date for a payment, allow 3-4 weeks for your check or [debit card](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-e-eip-cards) to arrive.

* If you're getting Payment Status Not Available, you will have to wait until you file your 2020 tax return to receive the Recovery Rebate Credit.

**If you are not eligible based on your 2019 tax return, or are eligible for a larger amount based on your 2020 tax return, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year to receive the owed difference of the [Recovery Rebate Credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit).** Common cases where this applies:

* I never received the first stimulus, even though I believe I was eligible, and still get an error when checking the Get My Payment portal

* I was a dependent in 2019 (and/or 2018 if your 2019 was not yet filed for the first stimulus), or mistakenly indicated that I could be claimed as a dependent, but cannot be claimed as a dependent for 2020 (Note: You don't just decide if you're a dependent or not, verify if you are eligible to be claimed as one [as defined by the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p501#en_US_2019_publink1000196863).)

* I had a child in 2020 and am now eligible for the additional amount for a qualifying dependent

### **FAQs:**

* **Q** How will I receive my stimulus payment?

* **A** 2019 tax returns returns are being used to calculate each person's stimulus payment. The bank account information provided on your 2019 tax return, whether that be for a refund deposit or debit of owed payment, will be used for direct deposit of the stimulus. 

* **Q** When will I receive my payment?

* **A** The deadline for second stimulus payments to be sent is January 15, 2021. After this date, if you have not received the stimulus payment yet, you will have to wait to claim it as the Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 tax return.

* **Q** I closed the bank account that I used for my 2019 return, or I do not recognize the account that the Get My Payment portal says it will be deposited to. How do I get my payment?

* **A** If the account is now closed or if the account information does not match an account you own, the payment will be returned to the IRS. You will then have to wait until you file your 2020 tax return to receive the Recovery Rebate Credit.

* **Q** I am eligible for the both the first and second and stimulus based on my 2018 and/or 2019 tax return, but will not be eligible based on my 2020 tax return. Will I need to pay back what I received?

* **A** No, there was no information provided in the bills requiring payments to be returned if eligibility changes between the 2018/2019 and 2020 tax years. This is also noted in the [IRS FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-j-reconciling-on-your-2020-tax-return).

* **Q** The [Get My Payment](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) portal says the payment was already sent and/or I received Notice 1444 in the mail saying my stimulus was sent, however I never actually received it. What do I do?

* **A** See the IRS page on [Payment Issued but Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Not Received](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-f-payment-issued-but-lost-stolen-destroyed-or-not-received) for guidance on starting a Payment Trace

The IRS has an extensive list of [Economic Impact Payment FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center) and a [news release](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-and-irs-begin-delivering-second-round-of-economic-impact-payments-to-millions-of-americans) regarding the second stimulus with more information

Be aware of potential scams related to stimulus payments or other coronavirus relief packages. CNBC has a helpful article with examples of [common stimulus scams](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/29/stimulus-check-scams-here-are-red-flags-to-watch-for.html).

At this time, [a $2,000 stimulus has been proposed](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602024/second-stimulus-check-update-senate-kills-2000-payments), but has not been passed by Congress. If that changes we will update this information to reflect that. 

# Payroll Tax Deferral

Payroll taxes consist of two related taxes: Social Security (6.2% of wages) and Medicare (1.45% of wages). Both employees and employers pay these taxes (i.e., for every $1 of social security taxes you pay, your employer also pays $1). Only the Social Security portion of payroll taxes may be deferred right now, not Medicare.

The Secretary of the Treasury has been [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/) to defer the collection of Social Security taxes on those making a gross income of less than $104,000 / year ($4,000 or less per bi-weekly paycheck) starting September 1.

Implementing seems to be optional by employers and many employers have decided to not implement this.

The IRS had issued Notice 2020-65 indicating that taxes deferred must be withheld and paid between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021, or interest and penalties will start accruing on May 1, 2021. **The window to payback the deferred taxes has been extended under the new stimulus bill to December 31, 2021. Deferred taxes must be paid by January 1, 2022 or interest and penalties will start accruing.** 

See the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for FAQs regarding the payroll tax deferral 

# Coronavirus-Related Distributions from Retirement Plans

Penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts for Coronavirus-Related Distributions ended December 30, 2020. If you made one of these withdrawals during 2020, remember that you have three years to pay the income taxes on the withdrawal. The IRS has an article with [Coronavirus-related relief for retirement plans and IRAs questions and answers](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/coronavirus-related-relief-for-retirement-plans-and-iras-questions-and-answers) with more info.

# Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Rollover

FSA account balances typically do not rollover year-to-year. The second stimulus package allows for FSA balances at the end of 2020 to be rolled over and used in 2021. Any FSA balance remaining at the end of 2021 may also be rolled over and used in 2022.

# Unemployment Benefits

Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) provides benefits to individuals typically not eligible for unemployment insurance, such as independent contractors or gig workers. Under the CARES Act these benefits were set to expire Dec 31, 2020. It has now been extended to March 14, 2021. Please visit your state’s PUA website for more information.

The previous unemployment relief of $300/week from the federal government and $100/week from the state expires Dec 26, 2020 (see the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for more information and FAQs regarding [this executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/) from August). **Under this new bill, federal unemployment will provide an additional $300/week through March 14, 2021, and the maximum number of weeks that unemployment can be claimed has been increased from 39 weeks to 50 weeks.**

**If you lost your job or are at risk of losing your job:**

Please read the information available in the [Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)

If you have any questions regarding those resources, feel free to ask here, but please be as specific as possible with your current situation and what steps you have taken so far.

# Student Loan Interest and Payment Waiver

The CARES Act suspended federally-held student loan payments and interest charges until September 30, 2020. The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/) signed in August extended this to December 31, 2020. The new bill has further extended this date to January 31, 2021.

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Most mortgage owners eligible for reduced or suspended payments for up to 12 months under the CARES Act 

Key points:

1. The CARES Act covers about [70% of all mortgages](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=406472) in the U.S. (those backed by Fannie and Freddie, FHA, VA, or USDA). Many companies have similar policies for most other types of loans. If you aren't sure what kind of loan you have, ask your servicer.

2. In most cases, you will [not owe the missed payments as lump sum](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/after-you-receive-relief/#repay). There was a lot of confusion about this. The new guidance says that lump sums are not required for [GSE](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Announces-Payment-Deferral-as-New-Repayment-Option-for-Homeowners-in-COVID-19-Forbearance-Plans.aspx) and [federal loans](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/SFH/documents/IACOVID19FBFactSheetConsumer.pdf).

3. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

4. Requesting mortgage relief/deferral will appear on your credit reports and may affect your eligibility for refinancing (but doesn't affect your actual credit score).

5. For more info, the CFPB published [step-by-step information](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/housing) about how to request payment relief.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs. 

Effective Dec 1, 2020, refinancing mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will incur a 0.5% [adverse mortgage fee](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/refinancing-a-mortgage-will-cost-more-thanks-to-an-adverse-market-fee.html). 

# Relief for Renters

The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/) signed in August required certain federal agencies to take steps to limit foreclosures or evictions. It did not include a list of specific actions or policies. 

Following this in September, the CDC ordered [Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions To Prevent the Further Spread of COVID-19](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/04/2020-19654/temporary-halt-in-residential-evictions-to-prevent-the-further-spread-of-covid-19) that expires December 31, 2020. **The new bill extends this order through January 31, 2021.**

Read [Protection for Renters](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/) from the CFPB and visit the [NLIHC page for COVID-19 Rental Assistance programs](https://nlihc.org/rental-assistance) for additional information and resources

2,Won a fellowship (grant) in Switzerland. They are wire transfering to me. How much is the bank markup?,"I am the lucky recipient of a Swiss fellowship to do research in the U.S. This will pay for my salary for 1.5 years. It is about 68,500 CHF (swiss francs) per year (approximately 77,078 USD). They will transfer this to me in annual installments via international wire transfer. I have an account at Wells Fargo. I read that Wells Fargo charges a markup at their discretion in converting the currency from CHF to USD. How much will I lose in during this wire transfer? Do you recommend that I ask the Swiss Fund to use a different service or for me to sign on with a different bank so that I don't lose money?

&#x200B;

edit: I just called the Wells Fargo line for foreign currency wire transfers to inquire about the Wells Fargo's exchange rate at this moment. It's 1CHF = 1.0866USD (74443.1USD) compared to google's reporting of 1CHF = 1.13USD (77405USD). So I would actually lose 2,961.9USD. That kinda sucks. Am I processing this information correctly?

&#x200B;

edit2: Thanks everyone for your input and advice. I've been reading it all. I may request to the fund to transfer the fellowship to my fiancé's Swiss account. Then transfer this in USD to my account. The foreign exchange rate markup is much less at my fiancé's swiss bank (max \~1.7%). I highly doubt the Swiss Fund would be willing or able to use other services besides a wire transfer.

3,Always ask for proof of debt!,"I got an email about a $200 debt from a collection company. I called and they said I made a transfer of that amount in November of last year, but that account had been closed since February. I asked them to send me proof, and they sent me a letter stating that my balance wasn't paid in full. I called today to again request proof of the debt, and he said since it's such a small amount they'll just drop the whole thing and won't report anything to the credit bureaus. I did research the company and they're legit, and I legitimately didn't owe the money, but it's always a good idea to make collections companies send proof before paying them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l65ma2/always_ask_for_proof_of_debt/,1611757766.0,5900,5900,0
4,Planning to relocate later this year. Will I be able to get a mortgage if I change jobs?,"My husband and I are planning to relocate later this year. We have been talking through this transition trying to make it as smooth as possible. We had initially decided that the best order of events would be: Find new jobs in new area, sell current house, purchase new house (need cash from the first house for the down payment on the second house). However, I’ve been thinking lately this might be problematic for getting a new mortgage. I remember when we purchased our current home, they wanted 2 years of work history at the same job for each of us (specially at the same job for 2 years, not just 2 years total work history). If we both get new jobs prior to purchasing the next house, is that going to become an issue when we try to get our next mortgage? My husband will be staying in the same industry as he’s currently in, but moving to a higher position. I will be making a move to a new industry that I have been working towards for several years, and my salary will likely increase a small amount. We have made all of the payments on our current house on time, and typically pay a bit extra on top each month. With the money from the sale of our current home, we will have a 20% down payment for the next one, plus quite a bit left over. Both of us have good credit scores and have never missed any payments. 

I don’t want to end up in a position where we’ve purchased a new house and are scrambling to find jobs to pay the mortgage, but I also don’t want to be in a position where we’ve found new jobs in the new area, but are unable to secure a loan because of lack of work history. Renting for a bit isn’t really an option. We’ve looked at apartments and houses for rent in the new area, but most of them don’t allow the breed of dog that we have (German shepherd), and are close to 2x more expensive a month as owning a home, which would be quite difficult for us to make payments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6xfrc/planning_to_relocate_later_this_year_will_i_be/,1611842793.0,54,54,0
5,30K (found) money,"We are fortunate to be the recipients of about 35k (tax free) and want advice on to what to do with it. We have no credit card debt, two car loans in the amount of 30k combined (17 Jeep & 18 Ram) and a mortgage with balance of 200k. We are retired and are comfortable. Should we apply the 35k to the mortgage or should we pay off the vehicles? My thinking is that if we apply it to the mortgage, it would mean bigger savings on interest in the long run.  Or we could pay off the cars and apply those monies to the mortgage, thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l70s23/30k_found_money/,1611850063.0,31,31,0
6,Am I Rothing right? IRA question.,"Thanks to this subreddit(!) I set up a Roth IRA through Charles Schwab in early 2019 and deposited the $5,500 max for 2018. 

I split the money between three “Schwab Target Index” mutual funds with the dates of 2050, 2055, and 2060 which would put me at 60, 65, and 70 years old. 

In early 2020 I deposited the $6,000 maximum for 2019 and again divided the money between the same three Schwab Target Index mutual funds. 

Besides depositing the maximum each year, am I doing this right? Should I be investing in something else (through my Roth IRA) in addition to the three mutual funds? Should I only be investing in ONE of the mutual funds? I always hear about how important diversity is in investing and retirement but I am not much of a risk taker and anything unknown feels risky. I want to know I am doing this wisely.

7,I just learned I have an eight year old tax debt in a state I haven't lived in since 2013... but I never received a bill or any kind of notice.,"I temporarily lived in Philly as a student on and off from 2009 to 2013, my permanent residence being WV. I held a few jobs at my university while there and had taxes taken out of my paychecks, but was exempt from filing because of how little I was making. I permanently moved to WV in 2013.

A family member received a notice from the Philadelphia revenue department last week, forwarded from an address that hasn't been mine since 2011, addressed to my maiden name. The letter was just a COVID update about electronic filing options, but I contacted them anyway to ensure their info was updated, since I'm no longer a resident.

They emailed me a form to fill out to close my account, and said I had a small balance (about $40) from an 2013 Earning Tax Return that was in collections. Neither of which I had any idea existed.

The money itself doesn't concern me because it's not much, but I don't understand I was supposed to know about this when I haven't lived there in nearly eight years and never got any notice about it in the four years I did live there. This is the first time I've received any mail at all from Philly in regard to taxes since 2014. And I have received zero correspondence from any collection agency about it.

Additionally, I've been regularly checking my credit report for the past few years, and nothing about this has ever popped up. It says I have nothing in collections. I know credit reports aren't always up to date, but I'd imagine for a supposed debt that is at least 8 years old, something would have been listed on my report by now, right?

Is there a way to verify this debt? Should I ask the collection agency to send proof? I'm assuming debt verification won't work since it's clearly been more than 30 days. The whole thing just seems super bizarre to me. I'll pay the $40 if I am responsible for it, no biggie, but I want to understand how this happened before I do.

Thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l70n3y/i_just_learned_i_have_an_eight_year_old_tax_debt/,1611849749.0,25,25,0
8,"My senior parents (Ontario, Canada) say they'll be homeless in 2 months, but I can't imagine they've done all they can for their situation.","I'll be honest, I'm a 23 year old who knows nothing about money besides to save it, hence why I'm here.

My parents are seniors (68f, 70m). My dad has worked his whole life as a self contractor doing carpentry. He was working up until September where he got chest pains, went to the ER and found out he immediately needed a triple bypass heart surgery. He was in the hospital for two weeks for prep and tests, and then another two weeks or so for recovery. They've told him that he cannot go back to work anymore - especially something so labour intensive. It took him over a month to be able to walk for more than a few seconds and he still struggles with breathing, plus he constantly needs to take a ton of heart medication now (for the rest of his life). Plus now he's at high risk due to covid. My mom has small scale babysitting (under five kids) but that came to an end when covid started.

My dad is in a lot of debt. I don't know the exact number but I'm guessing close to 100k between all his credit cards. My dad has a lot of credit cards with interest rates as high as 20%, and he's too stubborn to find a better option because he refuses to admit he's made bad financial decision.

I believe my dad got his pension sorted out and gets $700 a month. My mom hasn't applied for hers because she said she'll get $400 at most so it's not worth the effort ($400 is better than $0 Imo). They don't get any other government support in Canada. They're also Polish citizens. I don't know the exact details but my mom is getting some retirement money in Poland but she can only get it when someone visits Poland and brings it back for her - which I'm not sure why. I don't believe my dad is getting anything in Poland.

My sister has been pushing for my dad to file for bankruptcy to help with the debts, which he seems to be in the process of pursuing. They don't own anything. They rent an apartment and borrow my brothers car when they need it. I paid for uni out of my pocket so they weren't affected by that either. Their rent is ~$1400, which is really cheap for our area. My dad made about 35k a year before. 

Is there any other financial assistance they can get? I just can't understand how two seniors can only be getting $1100 in support when the average rent in my city is $2100 and so many others seem to have found at least some top up through covid relief (especially since my dad can't work anymore and my mom is his caretaker) or elsewhere.

I hope I included all the important info. Please ask if there's anything I missed.

Edit: I just want to thank everyone so so much for their input. I never expected so many of you would take the time to help me our and offer advice to guide me and my parents through tough times. I wrote this up before work on a whim thinking I'd get a few responses if any. I wish I could reply to everyone individually.

10,Wife accidentally claimed Exempt on 2020 W4. Will just paying the taxes we owe take care of everything?,"Hey PF,

I started doing my wife's and my taxes yesterday - this is only our second year filing jointly. I noticed her federal income tax withheld was extremely low, and that's when we realized she must have accidentally claimed 'Exempt' for 2020 when filling out her W4 last year. Her company made everyone update their W4s last year online and claiming exempt is just a simple check box, which she must have accidentally clicked. It coincided with us getting married, combining our bank accounts, and her getting a raise, so neither of us really paid attention to her pay stubs during 2020.

Anyways, when I entered my W2 info into FreeTaxUSA, it was estimating that we'd get some money back. After I entered her info, it is now estimating we owe $7K. Obviously this was not ideal to see, but luckily we are able to cover that. My question is: After we pay that amount are we good to go? Or should we expect any inquiries or something from the IRS? We are also in the process of closing on a house, so hoping this doesn't slow down our lending or add any complication (we're newer to this stuff, not sure how it affects each other).

1. I can pay cash for the car and have no payments but that would zap most of my money.
2. I can pay $5-7k in cash and get a loan for the rest.

USAA signature rates are 7.24%. $5k stretched over 24mos would be $224.41 monthly with a total loan cost of $5,385.84.  I can live with that no problem.

&#x200B;

Some guy from my high school got very rich off a tech device several years ago and then moved out to CA. We are friends on FB and he often posted that he was looking to hire. After I was in the area for college and broke, I messaged him and he took me on to run his FB page and do some marketing for a kickstarter he was starting for a new tech device. He was paying me like $1250 a month for very limited works so I was happy. I asked in the beginning about W2s and provided basic information because he said his assistant would help me get all that sorted.

&#x200B;

Anyway, fast forward several months and I start to realize this ""startup"" isn't going anywhere. I would ask questions about production and etc but he always had an answer about delays/the pandemic/etc. I was never paid on time for my work until I aggressively pestered and would receive like 3 months worth at once over Venmo or Zelle. I asked about taxes and was promised that his financial guy would be emailing me soon. After I asked too many q's, he pivoted me to another startup, and then I started doing more digging and realized he was linked to OTHER startups that he just had other people ""CEO"" because he was kicked off indiegogo and kickstarter. Basically raising 100k+ over a few months and then never delivering on a product. I was very scared and confronted an assistant of his and was basically told not to do anything because he had essentially mafia connections in Asia. I was also working as an intern for the US attorneys office and broke down and spoke to my supervisor asking how to handle it because I was complicit in scamming so many people and was essentially told it isn't pursuable b/c those sites don't have a delivery guarantee and the case will probably go nowhere. I quit on bad terms with my boss and another employee put in a complaint with an FTC. I feel very, very guilty that I essentially drove hundreds of people to pay hundreds of dollars for a product they will never receive and regret it very much. 

&#x200B;

All this to say, I made about $8,000 during the 6 months I worked for him (hired Dec 2019, didnt get start getting paid until Feb 2020) but have no idea how to report it or fill out my taxes. I am an undergrad student and a dependent with no other jobs so I am not filing any W2s or anything. There is no way he will fill out a 1099 for me.  How do I report this income? What do I file it as?

15% FXNAX Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund

70% FSKAX FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND

15% FTIHX Fidelity Total International Index Fund

I follow this in both the brokerage and tax advantaged accounts. I didn't know about ETF's being able to aid with taxes in non tax advantaged accounts until recently. Though I didn't pay much in taxes for 2020 in the brokerage. Only about $35 of capital gains and then the dividends. Given I use fidelity I'd like to maybe move to using vanguard ETF's in the brokerage the fidelity mutual funds in the tax advantaged accounts. This is a pain in the ass because there's so many tickers to remember.

But my questions

1) Why in the lazy portfolio do folks recommend total bond index funds like VBTLX/BND instead of long term treasury index funds like vlgsx/vglt? It would seem like for long term investing the long term treasuries are both safer and better performing.

2) Why in warren buffets portfolio for his wife does he pick 90% S&p 500 and then 10% short term treasuries? What is his thinking behind this?

3) How can I best setup my portfolio to win the taxes game? Maybe only holding bonds in the tax advantaged accounts? It was easier to just have the same in each vehicle. But i guess I could do what yields the best results.

I’m lowering my rate by about .6 percent, and we’ve taken a lender credit for a few points to cover our closing costs because we don’t expect to be in our house long enough for a slightly lower rate to be beneficial.

Is there any downside to doing this that I’m not understanding? It sounds like this is a no-risk situation since my rate will go down and I’m not covering the loan costs. (Also our loan term is staying the same)

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, my loans have been and continue to be in forbearance with 0% interest until October of this year. With my current salary of $75k, I've been able to save up about $35k in the bank; previously, I didn't know that loan forbearance would be applicable for as long as it is going to be, so I intended to just dump as much of my savings into my loans as I could at the beginning of this year.

Now that there aren't really any consequences to just saving more and more until October of this year, though, is there anything that I should be doing differently with my savings until then so that it is not just sitting in the bank? I still want to save up as much as I can and pay off my loans as quickly as I can, so is there anything I can do to grow the money before October?

Another quick thing I was wondering - I recently opened a Roth IRA. Do you think it's a good idea to be making monthly contributions to that, or should I focus on paying off my loans now with all of my savings instead?

37,Moving to the USA and starting a 401k,"Hi!

I'm in my mid 30s, recently moved to the USA and my employer is offering me a 401k plan from Vanguard. I'm married but currently have no children.

My idea is to live in the US for at least 5-10 years but I'll most likely end up to moving back to Europe when I retire.

After doing a lot of research I still have some questions and maybe some folks around here will be able to offer some answers:

1. How much % should I add? I know this is personal and 10-15% is a good amount, but is it possible to add too much? I've read the limit is $19,500, do I need to distribute that in 12 months at max? (the company is not matching any contributions btw)

2. Roth vs traditional. I think I want to go with traditional because I'll probably be in a lower tax bracket when I retire, hopefully living in southern Europe.

3. Are there any resources in this sub for people who move outside the US when they retire?

42,Carrying Cost of Housing Has NOT gone up significantly,"I was a little surprised to see this, but I was running some numbers on a few properties and realized that the actual monthly ""carrying cost"" of houses hasn't significantly increase, even in areas where the purchase price has gone up a ton.

This post shows a house whos price has gone up from $105k to $495k in the last 22 years and my post.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/l6knim/in\_1999\_this\_house\_was\_105k\_today\_490k\_in/gl1qnya?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/l6knim/in_1999_this_house_was_105k_today_490k_in/gl1qnya?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

What I realized is that although the sticker cost is much higher, the *actual carrying costs* aren't that much higher (if any), and the actual ROI as an investment is significantly higher.

Let's run the numbers:

||1999 Par|1999 (Inflation -> 2021 dollars)|2021 par|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Purchase Price|$105k|$165k|$490k|
|30yr Interest Rate|8.0%|8.0%|2.5%|
|Monthly Interest Payment|$667|$1,063|$969|
|Monthly Equity Payment|$68|$85|$870|
|Total Payment (PI)|$735|$1,148|$1,839|
|Taxes (estimate)/Insurance|$90/$50|$130/78|$300/$10|
|Total (PITI)|$875|$1,366|$2,239|
|**Total Carrying Cost (ITI)**|$807|**$1,271**|**$1,369**|

**From a ""Carrying Cost"" perspective (the actual net cost of servicing the property and debt), the 2021 house is only 7% more expensive, which is less than $100/mo.**

That means the houses are approximately the ""same cost"" to someone with plenty of cash flow.

Then the issue to buy the property becomes one of cash flow.

&#x200B;

||1999 Par|1999 (Inflation -> 2021 dollars)|2021 par|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Purchase Price|$105k|$165k|$490k|
|Down Payment (5%)|$5,250|$8,208|$24,500|
|Cash Required|$8,000|$12,500|$29,500|
|Total Payment (PI)|$735|$1,148|$1,839|
|**Income Required (payment = 50% net income @ 30% tax rate)**|**$26,000**|**$40,650**|**$63,050**|

That paints a little different picture.  More income and more cash is required to buy the house.  But once you have more cash and more income, less of your money is spent on ""carrying costs"" and more goes into equity.  That's both a good thing and a bad thing.  It's a very good thing if your income has scaled with inflation, but it's quite bad if you're in the threshold of people who can no longer afford the house.

Let's look at the outcome after 30 years of owership with a VERY conservative amount of equity growth and using some other assumptions I'm taking some minor liberties with inflation (don't want to use calculus) in comparing inflated 1999 dollars to today.

&#x200B;

||1999 Par|1999 (Inflation -> 2021 dollars)|2021 par|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Purchase Price|$105k|$165k|$490k|
|Cash Required|$8,000|$12,500|$29,500|
|Home Value After 30 years (3% annual growth)|$263,000|$406,000|$1,250,000|
|Total Carrying Costs (ITI - lifetime)|$214,000|$334,000|$311,000|
|Investing the lower payment at 7% return||$690/mo||
|Total Equity after 30 years (equity + investment)||$1,250,000|$1.250,000|
|Tax taken from gains||$210,000|$0|
|**Net Worth After 30 Years**||**$1,040,000**|**$1,250,000**|

As such, the actual financial situation of someone with a comparable income and cash flow is about the same using today's housing prices as using 1999 housing prices (inflation adjusted).

This **REQUIRES** that 1999 you invest the **FULL** difference between the cheaper (higher interest) home, and the more expensive monthly payments from today's loans.

And that's the crux.  As houses go up in price, there isn't a significantly bigger chunk of money going to carrying costs, but houses are accessible to less people and provide less flexibility for other investments during the life of the loan, but given average figures, the numbers are so similar.

But... tax benefits on owner occupied homes are HUGE.  There's very few other asset classes that allow you to take a 100% deduction on $1.2m in gains.

**The main conclusion I draw from this are:**

**TLDR;**

\- **Houses are not significantly more expensive than they were in the past on a CARRYING COST basis (Interest/Tax/Insurance)**

\- **The main issue here is that houses are** ***less accessible*** **to people with less cash flow due to bigger down payments and large PITI monthly payments**

\- **The high cost of housing today seems to be nearly 100% DUE TO LOW INTEREST RATES.**

\- **Tax breaks on owner-occupied houses are VERY significant.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6ppep/carrying_cost_of_housing_has_not_gone_up/,1611814165.0,22,22,0
43,Financing a car that doesn’t run - what are my options?,"I feel like there’s a better fitted sub for this, but idk what it is. Point me there, please.

Pretty much the title. I’ve never dealt with any of this before, and it’s not even me financing the car, it’s my mom. I think there’s about 2.5 years left to pay it off. Do we have any options? Or are we just stuck paying a note (and full coverage insurance) on a car that just sits in the driveway?

We’ve had it for almost 4 years. It started having problems in the last few months, and we would have it worked on, it would drive okay for a few days/weeks, but come up with another problem. One day I was driving home and noticed it was running hot (again), so when I went to pull over on the side of the road, it made a sad noise and died before I could turn it off myself. So I’m guessing it overheated and I’ll need a new engine. Which would be a few thousand to fix. But honestly, with the car having so many problems beforehand, it doesn’t even seem worth it to put 2-3k towards fixing it. But at the same time, we’re just wasting money paying the note every month when it doesn’t run. I feel terrible because my mom doesn’t make much money at all, and I hate for this burden to be on her shoulders. I’m getting married soon, so I was thinking about taking over the payments, but I don’t really want to pay for a car that doesn’t run, either.

I guess I’m just looking for insight/advice on what car dealership’s normal practices are and if they’d be able to help us at all. And the same for insurance as well. Or if there are any mechanics lurking around, would it be worth fixing??",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l712nx/financing_a_car_that_doesnt_run_what_are_my/,1611850691.0,3,3,0

48,Credit Card Payment Plan VS Big Payoff from Fed. Return? Advice Needed.,"I'm a very new adult (M23) on my own with my finances for the first time and have two options to attack my 2400 balance on a credit card.

Due to not being able to work last year (i work in entertainment) and having to use my credit card more for things, my balance grew and I'm trying to get in under control. Thankfully, I found a job doing some contract work, but unfortunately, my current salary really only covers my rent+bills with only about 100 dollars left over for food and anything else. I've also had to considerably drain my savings and am down to about 1800 to my name in savings accounts. It's tight, but manageable for the time being. But that means I don't have cash left over for credit card payments.

My credit card company has told me I qualify for a ""Short Term Financial Relief Program"" that offers up to 12 months of assistance. Here's what the company representative told me about the program:

>The APR on any Pay Over Time balance or on balances on Cards with a Credit Limit will be a maximum of 5.99% for 12 months.  
Your total monthly payments will be $42.00. You can always pay more. Enrollment will require first payment of $42.00 to be made today.  
While you are enrolled, we will not charge you late payment fees and annual membership fees (if applicable).  
If you have a Credit Card, your limit will be reduced, unless you’re over your limit.  A monthly spending limit will be applied on Charge Cards and adjusted periodically while you’re in the Program.  You can generally spend up to the amount of your monthly payment unless the balance is near, at, or over your limit.  
Reductions in your credit limits on Personal Credit Card accounts, may have an impact on your credit bureau score.  
Prescheduled automatic payments are required for Program enrollments.  
If your accounts are current, you will be able to spend, within a limit.  
If you’re being reported to the credit bureaus and make your payments on time, your account will continue to be reported as current if it's current now. Or if it's past due now, it will not be reported as further past due.  
Interest will be billed base on the balance at 5.99% APR.

Now, correct me if I'm wrong, this sounds like a high interest rate, so will I end up paying more money in the long run? And to be honest, I don't see how 42 dollars a month gets me to 2400 in 12 months. I'm bad at math, but not that bad... Does the payment plan, if I make higher than $42 payments a month boost my credit score?

Option number two I have is using my tax refund and stimulus payments. I am getting my 1800 dollar stimulus payments with my tax return as I didn't receive them with everyone else due to a name change issue. According to turbotax, i should be receiving $2640 from the IRS.

**Now my question for reddit is: Is there any benefit in doing a payment plan and putting my return into my savings/small safe investments in case of emergency? Or should I rid myself entirely of my credit card debt in one go? Any advice at all is greatly appreciated.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l731m4/credit_card_payment_plan_vs_big_payoff_from_fed/,1611854721.0,2,2,0

50,Financial advice (UK citizen),"Hi all, 

Completely new to Reddit (so say hello!). Only took me how long to join...

I am looking for some advice on my current financial situation. It’s really hard to talk to family and friends about this as:

1. I don’t want to worry them.
2. From what little they do know, my situation is worse than I initially described to them and I’m embarrassed by this.
3. No one I know has any background with financial advice so unsure if asking them would benefit me anyway

So I have turned to reddit to see if the community can help.

At this very minute I have a credit score of 476 out of 700 on ClearScore which seems good from what I can tell. I was hoping to get myself a mortgage soon and one thing i am conscious of is that a credit score isn’t completely indicative of whether you would be accepted for a mortgage. 

I was looking at houses priced £80k max. I currently have £5.5k in a Help to Buy ISA which will give me a 25% bonus on my final H2B ISA (to a maximum of £10k). I am currently putting £200 per month into this account and will continue to do so until I am ready.

I earn roughly £29k before tax per annum. The problem is I have a couple of debts at the minute, one which is a long standing debt which I can’t seem to shift.

I took out a credit card with an ex girlfriend in June 2017(stupidly only in my name) which i very quickly amassed a balance of £2.5k on. Since then, I have made efforts to reduce this balance however there has been occasions where I had to use the card. I had to perform a balance transfer around December 2019 as my 0% interest free period was ending January 2020. I transferred over to barclaycard with another 0% interest period up to two years. Unfortunately I had to rely heavily on the card when I moved out of my parental home in November 2019 so the balance on the card did shoot up. I did make efforts to reduce this but I have again fallen on hard times and my current balance is just below £3k.

I also have a car which is on PCP Citroen Simply Drive (which bundles your insurance, road tax, warrenty etc) which I am paying £431 a month on which will unfortunately increase in June due to a crash I had in September (no idea how much this has increased by I have not been informed yet which I find odd). The PCP ends in June 2022. I also have an 18 month personal loan with Zopa which I took out November 2019 - the loan being £1k and I now only have £263.83 to pay at monthly repayment rate of £65.96.

I guess what I want to know is how do I go about getting these finances in order? I really need to move out of my parental home ASAP as I’m nearly 27 and having moved out of my parental home on numerous occasions now it is really getting me down not having my own freedom. 

Would I get accepted for a mortgage despite these debts looming over me? Should I prioritise the Zopa loan which is smaller and at least would remove one credit facility on my credit file or should I put all of my focus on the credit card? Would cancelling my £300 overdraft help? (I only have on my account in case of emergencies).

I have a girlfriend and I enjoy a few luxuries such as a drink and a smoke of a weekend so naturally part of my disposable income is spent on this.

Appreciate you would need to have the full context and I am not expecting free detail financial advice because that would be wrong of me to do, but just a general idea of what I should or shouldn’t be doing would be a massive help!

I recently  (July) started a new Whole life policy with Northwestern Mutual.

Of course this was what the NW agent advised me to do.

From what I am reading here now, it seems the consensus is that this is a poor investment.  I'm already at least $1890 in the hole, should I terminate this policy before it gets any worse?  Is it really THAT bad an investment?  Obviously the valuation increases past the original death benefit.  Also, am I possibly subject to termination fees or anything similar?

63,California Tax/Unemployment Questions,"Hello,

I am trying to be ahead of the game and work on my taxes and could use some advice/tips tricks. I had a tough upbringing and last year was honestly the first time I ever filed taxes in a salaried position and wasn't poor. I'm 28 and single living with 1 housemate renting a room in a house.

Background leading to question:

I was working as a salaried Project Director for a non-profit organization which was contracted by the county government who was in turn contracted by the state government for a project. I worked there for all of 2019 and 6 months in 2020 then became unemployed in July 2020. My taxable wages from my job are $29,000, and for the rest of 2020 I was unemployed receiving $13,410 if im counting all PAC payment additions with weekly benefit amounts. I was listed as either 1 or zero for my job allowances and I also elected to have taxes witheld on every disbursement from unemployment.

 Questions/concerns 

I am working on my taxes and haven't received my 1099G yet from unemployment but im curious if all additional/PAC payments are included in my income? Is my unemployment taxable in California? Do you have any advice guidance tips or tricks to help or articles to refer me to with regards to different deductions or credits I can receive? 

I would go to a tax prep location but feel sketched out by tax prep chains. 

Thank you all in advance.

First of all, I would like to say, yes, I know it's just $20, but I'm a poor college student trying to get by. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

I'll try to make this short. So I rented a textbook from a website called BooksRun, they seem legit. Paid. Got my book alright, had some highlighting in there, but that's ok. (It was described as ""used-good condition"" which means some markings but all text are legible.) I returned it, then got a charge of $20, saying I ""damaged"" the book (aka highlight). I contacted them, saying I didn't do that. They gave me some BS response, saying I damaged the book and it's now in ""used-acceptable condition"" which means ""some markings but all text legible."" I'm like WTF, first of all, I didn't do that, and second, these conditions are completely arbitrary. I asked if they have proof (i.e. pictures) of the condition it was in before they sent the book to me. They said upon request, yeah. I'm like, ok, I request them. Now they're saying somehow the pictures magically disappeared and can't find them. It's really clear at this point that they're just trying to scam me out of $20 and doesn't care what I'm saying. I'm trying hard to keep fighting with them but i'm pretty hopeless that they'll voluntarily refund me/reverse the charge.

My question is, will I be able to call my bank (wells fargo) to dispute this transaction? It's still pending so I can't do it online, but I'm not sure if they will reverse the charge since I technically gave the company my card info when I rented the book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l75s9e/got_scammed_20_and_i_need_help_disputing_the/,1611861378.0,1,1,0

However, thanks to Corona virus I lost my job, and I’m currently working as a temp at another company making a fraction of what I was making before while now being a little bit more cash Poor.

After I receive any of those RSU drops, how/where do I store them? Do I need to seek out a financial service like charles swab or robinhood or w.e? Should I have this in order prior to the first RSU drop? 

Once I receive them will I be able to do with them what I like (keep or immediately sell)?

If I leave the company prior to 4 years, am I allowed to keep the portion of RSU I have already collected?

- 1 Apple Card With a limit of $2000 with no balance that was opened the beginning of this month.
- I have no missed payments in two years. I recently paid off my vehicle loan off as well.

There’s no work life balance, the management is unhelpful and sometimes plain rude, and I’m finding myself losing the passion I had for this job. The contract I signed has 4 years left in it for full loan forgiveness from the company, and I just don’t think I can make it that long.

I was a transfer student from another state so I had no friends at school, and with my mental issues I was just having a very bad and unmanageable experience. I attended therapy and received medication through the school but made no progress, and I can't afford other private therapists.

Now about a year later, I'm still left with the credit status of a sophomore and a GPA of 1.23. My GPA from my first year was much, much better, but it doesn't matter since my uni doesn't count grades from other schools. I can't raise my GPA to the 2.0 minimum for federal aid without taking more classes, but I have no way of paying for them. I've applied for private loans but being 21 with minimal credit to my name I'm not approved, and I don't have anyone willing to cosign, so that's not an option either.

I can't see any other option than to drop out of my current school, as even part time tuition is 10k+ and the most I can personally get a loan for is around 5k. I'm thinking my best option is to start job hunting, I have a decent resume with 3yrs retail work and 2yrs in a summer camp director position.

I was a teacher for about 6 months at a private school (my mom is a principal at a private school so she recommended me) then due to covid, I got let go as the school lost too many students to afford their latest hire.

I will be in school fulltime afterwards until December. My current salary is 30k pre-tax for the half year.

However, I will be taking out student loans at the grad level interest rate (5.3%) starting July, and would like to avoid as much loans w/interest upfront as possible in July and not rely on tax returns early next year, even if it means only avoiding 1k or 2k of taxes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l73k2v/6_month_job_and_grad_school_afterwards_file/,1611855812.0,1,1,0

107,"HSA newcomer, need investment guidance","Just got married in October, and for 2021 my wife and I enrolled in a HDHP/HSA through her employer. Employer's contribution to the (Fidelity) HSA covers 75% of the plan deductible, and they've already deposited that full amount into the account. We also contribute $50 per paycheck on top of the employer's contribution.

Neither of us has ever had an HDHP/HSA before, but even with the medical costs we expect to have this year (not insignificant, but generally predicted) the math worked out in favor of that approach.

Right now we're sitting on over $2k in the HSA, but we plan to have ongoing health expenses right away (therapy, prescriptions, one-time neuropsych evaluation, and more). We plan to charge these kinds of expenses to earn credit card points and reimburse ourselves, rather than using an HSA debit card.

Thus, our questions are:

1. Given how immediately we expect to have reimbursable expenses, should we invest our HSA funds into something like FHSNX, or should we plan to keep it all in cash?

I credit this sub, and having worked as a publicist for several personal financial startups over the years, as formative forces that have pointed me in the right patch for my own PF journey. 

I know and subscribe to the tone of the sub: patience, diligence, living within your means etc. and fully know that the ""can i borrow from my retirement to fund X"" is often rightly met with a resounding 'no, you can't afford it then. re-evaluate.'

---

I'm not explicitly looking to do this, but just wanted to consider all possible levers that might be at hand to help A/B test some scenarios for my family.

**The Bottom Line Up Front:  I know you can tap contributions in a ROTH IRA + 10k in earnings penalty free for a first time home purchase.  But is it possible to do so from a ROTH 401k?** I changed jobs in 2017 but left the money to grow in here (Vanguard Admiral/Institutional Index shares) instead of rolling it over to my existing Fidelity ROTH IRA.  So first off, since this is a fund with an old employer, i know a 401k loan is out of play--not that i'd want to do that anyway with the risk involved.

---

I dont want to consider going down this path if it'll trigger a withdrawal 10% penalty + tax event (as it would for a traditional 401k). But from everything i've read online it's a little unclear about how this work in a ROTH 401k format.  I believe that you can not use a roth 401k for a down payment in the '10k of earnings can be penalty free for first time homebuyers' scenario.   But havent been able to make heads or tales of whether you could access your contributions.   I believe i stumbled across something last night where--since money is fungible--you can't just delineate that you'll want to take $30k of 'contributions' out of a $185k total portfolio value.  But that they'll pro-rate based upon that total portfolio value and then hit you with the 10% + tax on the percentage that you're withdrawing that corresponds to the contributions v. earnings makeup of your portfolio.

If *that's* the case, i likely dont want to go down this road.  

----

Lastly--and i couldnt find this answer definitively either--but there seemed to be some indication that rolling over a Roth 401k into a Roth IRA (existing already to not run afoul of the 5 year rule)--might enable you to then access those funds as additional contributions.

-----

Why am I asking all of these questions:  looking to purchase a home in the next 4 months in a HCOL area.  I've been over-indexing over the years toward saving for retirement (i know...truthfully, there's no such thing), but at the expense of a down payment fund.  My wife and i have a 9 month old crawling around out 1BR apartment and are looking to build a life that hopefully leads to having 3 children (and i'd prefer to potentially grab a 4BR house in our area vs. 3 if possible so we can jump right into a home that can work for us long-term).  Now she's an 11 year tenured teacher with a pension in a good school district and has maxed out her degree steps on the payscale so i am considering how to balance my innate desire to over-save for the future vs. living now.  We have about 220k in retirement now, mostly all in ROTH vehicles + this theoretical pension and about 103k saved for a down payment 

We were approved for something stupidly high in terms of a housing budget, which i dont want to go anywhere near, BUT...i do just want to consider all our options.  Inventory is tight here and ideally we'd love to settle in a range that's 600-650k home and about $3-3.5k mortgages.  *tiniest violin in the world* most of those options dont exist as single family homes in the towns we're looking into, but there are a bunch in that 750-800k band that are perfectly turnkey.  Taxes are a PITA except for a few select towns we're especially targeting.  

---


**But like net net....** i dont think we want a home in the 4k monthly payment (principle, interest, tax escrow) range which would be this 750k level given our down payment.  So i was weighing if i could stomach just the opportunity cost of grabbing a little from the ROTH 401k to perhaps bolster our down payment and our ability to potentially (if we find a property we love in this range) knock that monthly payment into the 3600 or 3700 range.

--

This is likely just a theoretical exercise.  I dont want to get us out over our skis.  And maybe it's a moot point already if i already had our credit run for a pre-approval process.  They had us list this ROTH 401k as an asset, but am i in a lockup period where i wouldnt be able to convert it into an existing 5year+ ROTH IRA without drawing a million red flags?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l72yld/tapping_part_of_roth_401k_contributions_for_a/,1611854544.0,0,0,0

117,Should I refinance my mortgage with another bank,"Hey I bought a flat in Europe 2,5 years ago. I got a mortgage for 15 years with 15 years fixation. I thought it is good idea to pay debt ASAP, so I chose minimum length I can handle ok from my salary. The effective interest rate is 2,7%.

Currently I can get better interest rates with refinancing, about 1,3% effective, which I definetelly will do. But.

I would like to change to 20 years mortgage length with 15 years fixation.

I asked my current bank, but they just dont allow me to change the contract to 20 years. I tried to persuade them without effect. I dont even get why (why?), they dont explain it. 

They offer me a change to better rate, about 1,3% for 250€ fee. This would sink my monthly payment from 900€ to about 850€ and I would keep the rest period of 12,5 years. Also the fee for this change is low.

But I would really like to pay less monthly:
1. Since interest rates are so low, I dont save much by paying fast and I don't like to stick so much from my salary (2600 €) to the flat.
2. I could save more money, which I could invest. I earned very good on my investments before I got mortgage, I could afford investing back then.
3. Altrough I have emergency fund of 11 000€, I would be less stressed to know, that if I loose job, or if I would like to take time off to travel, I can do it. I am single. Currently my cash flow is just slightly positive and I don't feel good about it. Also I am quite young, 30 years, and I would like to have more cash to just enjoy life.

If I refinance, I have to do it with different bank:
1. closing costs would be about 3000€ and this repulses me, since I see it just like wasted money. I could get same interest with my bank, but I would have to keep the rest period and bigger monthly payments as explained above.
2. I would have monthly payment of about 560€, 20 years period with 15 years fixed. I would have also possibility to pay yearly 10 000€ extra payments without a fee.


What should I do? I can handle 850€ payments if I choose to refinance with my bank and I would have to pay only 12,5 years. But I explained what I don't like about it.
Or should I refinance with other bank despite high closing costs? I would pay less, but I also don't like the perspective of a mortgage for next 20 years. And that closing costs. 

I am a software developer I should never have a problem to find a good paying job. But I still can get sick or something and I worry too much, so having tight budget is stressing me a bit.

What would you do?

118,Purchasing used car advice,"I’m currently on the market for a used car. It is my first time buying a car (I have tried before at a small sketchy dealership and it ended up getting repoed after a month and it’s not on my credit so I’m not going to count it) I have a 2007 Acura RDX and honestly would keep it but the heater doesn’t work and something about the battery always dying that even the dealership couldn’t fix.

Anyway, I have about 10k-12k I can put down, my credit score on Credit Karma is 630 but my credit card says it’s 580. (I just recently settled some debt I had in collections as well) I have been emailing a dealership about a 2020 Acura RDX 7k miles $35800 (was $35987 but “lowered” it since I inquired). I know going to the actual dealership is more effective, but I need to find time for someone to go with me. I let the salesperson know what was up and their response was “what can I do to assist you on the deal?” So now I’m stuck, I don’t know what else I can or should ask for. Can you ask to lower the price? Do they give you some fun bonuses? I have no idea lol

We are both software engineers with a combined income of \~$240k and would like to build wealth for our children while still meeting our personal career goals while we are still alive.

I'd like to start a PhD program in the next 2 years and that would be about 6 years of a reduced combined income of \~$130,000. This does not include other investments, business income, and retirement savings. 

Since we are late to the savings/retirement game, we know we have to do a lot to catch up to what we want to leave our children after we die. We probably won't get there but we want to try our damned hardest.

What I would like to figure out is how grad school would affect our plans. What's the formula or calculation I need to compute to understand if a PhD (fully funded) is a good financial decision given our future goals? Or if I find a way to match my current income in the next two years, would this be a useless question?

I am honestly okay with pivoting if a PhD would set us back. Please feel free to educate me on how families set themselves up for generational wealth as well.

122,Company is withholding pay raise (corresponding to a promotion) pending a review into all salaries from an outside firm,"Hi All,

I work for a fairly established consulting firm and was ""recently"" promoted in November as part of the latest 6 month review cycle (pretty standard process at consulting firms, you have reviews every 6 months and its decided at that point if you are promoted or not). I was told to expect a salary increase in December after that promotion (nothing official, just verbally by a manager). Hadn't heard anything the week before our monthly paycheck so reached out to HR to ask and told it was not going to be included in that paycheck, kinda bullshit but whatever. After my salary increase was not included in January I went to a manager, who directed me to HR. I was told by HR they forgot to email me (insane)  but that they brought in an outside firm to review salaries in December (they know exactly when promotions will happen, so no clue why'd they wouldn't do this before) and that I won't know what my increase in salary would be until March. So i would remain at the same salary until then. They said once the new salaries are announced it would be backdated to January. Besides the general horrible communication, i feel like that is honestly one of the most ridiculous things i've ever heard. ""Work for the next 2 or so months at a salary we will determine later"". There is no guarantee it'll be what I think it is and my expectation is that it should be a sizable increase (potentially 25/30K) based upon the projects i've completed and feedback received. 

And yes, i know Reddit quickly goes to the ""leave the company"" and ""the company is always wrong"" type answers (not that they arent) but i've been able to assume a lot of responsibility, gain a significant amount of experience and am (seemingly, but who knows) poised to quickly advance my career. I have started interviewing and it seems like i shouldn't have an issue moving companies, but I feel like I will have to regain the trust and responsibility i've been given in my current position so it will be a slight setback. 

I have a meeting set up to discuss this with HR/ a department lead and more so am looking to get some thoughts on if others have ever been in a similar situation and its more typical that i am thinking. Or if this is batshit and the company might potentially not be able to pay salaries and Im right to be as pissed as i currently am",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6j3wb/company_is_withholding_pay_raise_corresponding_to/,1611794104.0,21,21,0
123,What's the preferable market for upgrading out of your starter house?,"We're considering moving to a larger house at some point in the future, but aren't in a big hurry.

Presently, it seems like the housing market is pretty inflated, especially in our area. Our house is worth quite a bit more than we bought it for, but obviously if we sold it now to buy another, equally inflated house, we're not benefitting. Likewise, if we wait for a market lull and buy a new house for cheaper, we lose out some by selling our house in a worse market.

Giving it some thought, it seems like it should generally be preferrable to buy when prices are down (IF you're upgrading to a more expensive home, and vice versa if you're downsizing). Hypothetically, say the market is up. My house is worth $300k now with $150k owed, and I'm looking at a $500k house. My new mortgage is going to be for $350k. If the market took a downturn and both house values dropped by 25%...my house is now worth $225k with $150k owed, and the new house is now $375k, so my new mortgage is $300k. I know this is greatly oversimplifying, ignoring closing costs, assuming that value of both houses is affected exactly the same, etc. But it seems to make sense to look for a favorable market for the more expensive house.

Since we have the luxury of waiting, what's the convential wisdom on when is best to make the jump from ""starter house"" to ""nicer house""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l71xpl/whats_the_preferable_market_for_upgrading_out_of/,1611852442.0,0,0,0

I was super unhappy with my company's decision to move our 401K from Vanguard to Voya, so I finally took a small risk and opened a Vanguard Roth IRA. I pulled money out of HYSA and put $6000 into the IRA for 2020 contributions and $1000 for 2021 with plans to make small contributions through out the year till max.

Now I am starting to panic. Of that $7000 I am down $200 today and all I can think is, yeah 0.5% interest was losing money to inflation but now as I sit here today I have lit $200 on fire and watched the ashes scatter to the winds.

126,Need advice on unused home equity,"Backstory: My in-laws are planning to move across the country from UT to NC once my FIL retires this coming spring. They'll sell their home in Utah and buy a home with an in-law suite in North Carolina using the cash from the sale; they then plan to do extensive retirement travel (after vaccination) and won't be in the states most of the time for the next four years or so. Because they don't just want to leave their possessions in an empty house they've asked my wife and I to move with them to North Carolina and stay in their new home; when they're in the US they'll live in the in-law suite so we'll have completely separate living. As part of the arrangement, all we'll have to pay for is property tax and utilities, and they won't charge us rent at all since we're helping them by maintaining the property. This means we'll be saving around $800 per month by not having to pay a mortgage, depending on how high the property taxes and utilities end up being.

My question is about our own investments: We own the condo where we live now and have about $100,000 in equity built up. Neither of us are very interested in renting it out because while it might be somewhat profitable we just don't want the hassle of being landlords living in another state, and don't really want to work through a property management organization - it's not completely off the table, but it's not really what we want to deal with. Anyway, if we do end up selling we'll be sitting on that equity for 4-5 years until the in-laws move back for good and probably sell that home to buy/build a permanent retirement home there.

I don't just want to stick the money in the bank - I'd rather it be generating something more for us.

142,Seeking Derogatory Mark Advice,"So about ~~8~~ [edit: 6] years ago I had an appointment at my local Health Department, for which I was billed roughly $100.  At the start of Coronavirus stuff of 2020, my credit dropped 50 points abruptly. I looked into it and discovered a new derogatory mark.  Apparently this bill back then had gone to Collections.

My issue is I am fairly certain I paid this bill. I remember quite distinctly I had fronted my mom money for an expense of her's, and by the time my appointment took place she had her finances worked out so when she learned I had this appointment she said ""oh lemme write a check for that!'.  It was really nice of her, which is part of why I feel confident this bill was paid; I remember in such detail lol.  I also could be trippin but I also visually remember handing  something to the lady in the office there...was it a check? Or was it a signature approving future billing? I don't remember tbh but I handed her something and it was paper.

I've never had a derogatory mark before so of course I looked into this and in the course of my reading I learned that my initial impulse to just pay off the [now $228] debt is, in fact, *not* the best thing to do for one's creditscore. I learned it's better to contest the derogatory mark and have it removed, than to admit to an overdue bill and pay it.

So a few questions.  First, is that advice true?

Secondly, if my mum did in fact write a check and that's not in my imagination, what are the odds I could (with her assistance) find proof of this through her bank? Could she just be like ""Hey did I write a check for x amount to x person in x year?"" And they be like ""Yeah here's proof"" ?

Third, if I can't secure proof of my own that I paid this bill, should I move forward with contesting the derogatory mark anyway?  I read somewhere else that 'the burden of proof', so to speak, is on the Collections agency to make a case, and that if its too much hassle for them to prove you owe money they will just drop the mark. Is that true?

Any advice or related banter will be appreciated and welcome.

Btw the timing of this mark just suddenly showing up on my report was weird to me.  It honestly crossed my mind that the state and other entities were at that time prob scrambling to collect $ however they could, given current events and the spooky state of the economy.  Like a supposed debt from [5] years prior just so happened to pop up within weeks of announcement of stimulus checks stuff.. Any merit to my hunch or nah? Think it was mere coincidence? Did this happen to anyone else? Is it normal for it to take so long ([6] yrs) for a debt to show up?  This series of questions doesn't matter so much to me but sorta wana know if my thought was crazy or not haha.  It was devastating to watch my credit drop 50 points all at once when I'd worked so hard to establish good credit and this just seemed so wack to me, but I also didnt wana discount this kinda thing could just be commonplace.

Its been a year and I still haven't handled the mark but now with interest rates so low I might want to finance something soon which has me frowning at this mark again and thinking I should stop procrastinating and handle it.

Update: Asked spouse what year we had that health dept visit.  He says it was late 2014.  That changes my timeline so that the bill was issued a little over 6 years ago from today and so therefore the mark showed up on my credit report roughly 5 years after the appointment billing. Given input from commenters it appears accuracy of my timeline might matter. I was a whole 2 years off sorry.

147,Need help budgeting for apartment,"I graduated college last May and work for a really nice company now, but my pay isn’t great. I’ll have about 3.5 months of emergency savings saved up by the time I need to move. I’ve lived with roommates for four years now and its honestly been a bit of a nightmare between some bad roommates and really awful landlords. I really want to get a place on my own, but I grew up poor so I’m very hesitant. 

My take home pay after taxes/deductions is $1,150 every two weeks. There will be pay increases throughout the next year and by March 2022 I should be making about $500 extra per month since thats when I get a small promotion. By then I also expect to have my partner move in with me, and my car will be paid off a few months later so I won’t have that expense anymore. I really just need to know if its realistic to plan on getting a one bedroom apt once my current lease is up in May. 

expected budget:

850 - rent and fees //
250 - car payment //
100 - car ins //
50 - gas //
110 - health ins //
160 - cats stuff //
200 - utilities //
250 - groceries //
150 - misc //
80 - phone //

total: $2200

Sorry for formatting im on mobile, edited a bit to make it easier to read.

These totals are sorta generous imo, I don’t think I’ll spend that much on food, cat stuff, etc, but I’m worried still. I pay $400 for rent now, and $100/month for utilities, most of the other expenses are the same. the one bedroom I’m looking at would total $710/month and the 2 bedroom is $820. Only considering the two bedroom because I work from home and am not sure if I could fit my work stuff in a one bedroom. Heat and pet fees are included in the rent. I only expect to need to pay internet and electric on top of that, maybe cooking gas. Also, I’m currently on medicaid so I don’t need to pay for my health insurance until the pandemic is over and I’m kicked off medicaid, no clue when that will be, the $110 budgeted would only take effect once I lose state coverage. 

I get a $5500 bonus at the end of the year but I plan to save that towards a house payment, if I need to it can also just go towards my expenses.   I am able to do overtime, if I did 8hrs of overtime a month it would bring home about an extra $180 after taxes. Besides saving for a house, I really don’t need to set aside money for anything, but obv i’d be more comfortable not living paycheck to paycheck. 

Is this doable? Am I forgetting anything? Any suggestions? My family lives abroad and all of my friends moved out of state or back in with their parents, so once this lease is up I would either need to live alone or find a stranger to live with.

My financial goal is to retire early. Currently I have a ROTH IRA and an Individual Brokerage Account. I also have stock options at a small but growing business. I definitely should probably get a Traditional IRA at some point

Currently most of my investments though are in my ROTH IRA -- probably about 80% of my portfolio. 

However, I understand that there are some mild penalties for withdrawing early. As stated above - my goal is to retire early. Not at the age of 59 ---- I potentially see myself retiring earlier than that and living abroad.

149,First proper middle class job! What the hell do I do with this money?,"Hello reddit, you all seem really smart with money so I’m looking for advice before I meet with a financial advisor at my bank tomorrow.

I’m 29/F in Canada. Employed in my career of choice at a Crown corporation.

Current salary is $60k, so 40ish? after tax and deductions, which includes a decent pension plan (I pay in $4k a year and employer matches).

I have $30k in savings just chillin in a regular savings account. I will be moving some of that into a TFSA, I imagine, and then invest in index funds because that’s what tiktok told me to do.

I have $60k in student loans from the federal and Ontario governments. I’m using repayment assistance to cut monthly payments from $700 to $350. I’m not too concerned about paying it off quickly - I might be completely wrong about this, but it seems smarter to invest that extra cash and take the interest hit? I’ve only made a few payments at this point and haven’t really made a dent in it.

I give my boyfriend $600 a month to help with bills and live in his house. I don’t want to buy a house but wouldn’t mind building a slick off-grid cabin at some point.

Travel is really important to me, so I want to set aside a few grand a year for that.

Monthly net income is $3200-$3600 depending on OT. Paying rent/loans/bills/groceries leaves me with about $1700 to play with and buy new clothes, save for travel, and invest.

I recently made a couple of big purchases (Invisalign and furniture) but don’t foresee splurging on much else in the near future. I’m not that fancy so I find I can save pretty easily.

So, reddit....How would you guys start growing my current savings, and how much should I put away per month? Should I have a few investment accounts? A points credit card? Basically, how would you tell me to stop thinking like a broke-ass student, just hoarding my money and leaving it in the bank forever?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6y222/first_proper_middle_class_job_what_the_hell_do_i/,1611844312.0,0,0,0

I pursued this vigorously, contacting all three entities: Equifax, the original owner (electric utility company), and the collections company. 

Fortunately it went smoothly with the electric utility and upon my providing requested documentation they investigated and agreed that the debt was not mine. They instructed the collections company of this and to remove any detrimental information from CRA's. 

Reading this forum today and coming across the Collections Wiki made me wonder (again) why I was not directly contacted about the debt before it was reported to Equifax. 

I suppose one explanation as to ""why not"" is that collections had contacted the actual debtor at their known address, who was unresponsive. So collections reported to Equifax.

TMI, sorry.  


Anyways, I have about 130k in debt between private and federal loans. I refinanced this year to get a 4.43% interest rate on my private loans which helped a lot since my payment was originally like 1700 dollars... Now it is \~830 and i pay 900 to save myself a couple of years of paying. My federal loans are like 220 and have no interest currently due to relief bills.  


As for retirement, I am putting in 8% into my 401k. My company matches half of 8% so I am getting the full company match but I also get an extra 2% into that account and 4% into another account since I am a part of our union.

I want to put it in something high return and am fine with the risk, hence: interested in small cap.

Let me list it out, for example, 2 below very popular and established small cap funds - I won't list all, but I have googled SO many popular small cap index funds (Fidelity, Vanguard, etc.) & it's all about the same as the below - they seem to not perform as well compared to S&P 500:

""Fortunately, we have data that lets us look at every 40-year period since 1928. I think the numbers are very instructive.

Taking all those periods into account, the S&P 500’s average 40-year return was 10.9%, considerably less than the 16.2% average for small-cap value stocks.

The best 40-year period: 12.5% for the S&P 500 and 19% for small-cap value. The worst 40-year period returns were 8.9% and 11.6%, respectively.""

I currently make 135k at my current job, but I am quite unhappy in the role, and I feel like I have little to no growth in the company in the next 2-3 years.

Equity: 1,000 Shares

They said the signing bonus is rare for employees. But, I don't think 85K is enough to leave my job, regardless of the signing bonus and equity. I am going to counter, but I feel conflicted at what to counter with, because I'm not sure anything less than 115K would make sense for me to take a paycut, and they've made it clear to me that they could not reach a number that high. I also know this job would most likely be more work on a smaller team than my job right now. Just wanting thoughts on this and where to go from here.

After a very tough year of job searching while living with my parents after losing a 45k/year job, I’ve finally been offered a job. The job is in my desired (difficult to enter) industry but pays only 32k/year. It is in a relatively low COL city where I believe I could get an apartment for 600-800 dollars a month. I am looking for some help imagining what my expected expenses could be, and if this is a feasible opportunity to take for the next 2-3 years. 


Some details about my financial situation:

No debt

No car payment/own a decent car that should only require regular maintenance

Currently no phone bill (but have an old, barely functioning phone)

10k savings


Based on a rough estimate, I think I would take home 2,000 dollars a month. Minus hypothetical rent of 800 dollars I would have 1,200 a month leftover. Is 1,200 enough to be comfortable with a frugal budget? What expenses am I forgetting? At that level would I be in a crisis situation if any emergencies hit?

One of the ways I justified spending this much time looking into this, (not the years - shame! - but the past few months) is that **I really plan for this be as “set it and forget” of an approach** **as possible** (unless I need to rebalance), and once I’m set up to focus on just doing my best to max it out each year, and leave it alone for the next 30 years or so. (For what it’s worth, I’m in my mid 30s now, and also, at least believe now - untested - that I fully understand that my balance will fluctuate, likely drastically, and to ignore it and not panic sell).

I narrowed my options to these (sort of in order of what I am leaning toward most (not necessarily for crucial reasons):

**1)**  
**3 Fund Portfolio** (not set on exact allocations or even exact funds)

I took the job in this state to be closer to him since things got more serious after I bought the house. I still have a room in the house and used to come to the house during time off, weekends, etc. My job let me work remotely anywhere 2x a week and sometimes I traveled for work to a site nearby the house so I made a pit stop at the house.

I am still living in the other state and haven't been to the house much because of Covid (my house roommates deal with the public so I feel more comfortable not travelling). I'm thinking of refinancing the mortgage and with Covid, my employer is reviewing their remote working policies which may let me work from anywhere permanently so I can either stay out of state or live in the house. My bf's work is thinking of expanding to the state where I have my house. Both haven't made a final decision yet about the long term.

I am unclear at this point if I will ever return back to the US but if I do it will most probably be for an employer who will have a 401(k) matching plan in place. In such a case, will having moved to an IRA be detrimental in any manner?

180,Investing in something tangible,"Hello, this is my first post here and I should note, I don’t know much about money. 

I work and make money and never had to spend it on anything besides myself and my interests. 

My parents have saved a lot of money in their lifetime - some of it grew thanks to their investments, some of it just sits there waiting, some was spent on the apartments for my brother and sister and the house my parents live in. They are doing well, by all means. 

My parents bought these apartments for my siblings after COVID affected the country (it’s in the EU). My parents, unlike me, are well educated in finance and suggested that I should also look for an apartment they could buy for me. As amazing as it sounds, this is not a part of my plan at the moment, as I live overseas and see ownership of an apartment or land as an uncomfortable obligation. 

But now they want to use the money, which, as they say, might be affected in the future by whatever future brings, for example it may lose its value. I understand their sentiment but still, for now I don’t see myself picking an apartment in my home country or a foreign one. 

What other items are good to buy instead of an apartment which could be monetised in the future? Gold bars? Jewellery? Fine art? What are the pros and cons of these investments vs an apartment or house?

I am wanting to move out of my flat to either a detached or semi-detached property in the next few years and have came up with 3 options and was wondering if anyone could point out any pros/cons to what I am thinking and if they have experience in similar situations. The options that I believe I have are:

1) attempt to save up enough of a deposit for the detached house I want to live in then get a mortgage for it as a second home (however I would then need 25% deposit on the second property which where I live would be quite steep), then renting out my current flat to cover the cost of the remaining mortgage on it.

2) Sell the flat I currently live in and use the equity from that to put towards the detached house I want. Then after a few years of saving buy a property to let out 

3) Take money out of my current mortgage (I could probably get about £40,000) and combine it with my savings in order to meet the 25% deposit for second homes then rent out my original flat again, covering that mortgage and slightly more 

I have currently stopped overpaying my mortgage in order to build up savings for a deposit incase option 1 is the way I decide to go however I don’t know if this is even the right thing to do in terms of saving money on interest compared to having an instantly accessible lump sum.

First question 

W2 Box 1 - Wages, tips, other comp. - is this net of FIT and FICA withholdings? My guess is not since it pulls into the 1040 before being calculated down to AGI where the tax rate is applied.

Second question

All things being equal, For purposes of deriving cash flow, if XX reflects...

1. [W2 Box 1] gross salaries of $100
2. [W2 Box 4] social security tax of $13 
3. [W2 Box 6] Medicare tax of $2
4. [1040 line 15] total tax of $20

... do I have enough information to get an accurate cash flow figure? My guess is yes since, generally, employers can pay 50% of FICA, but they can also pay up to 100% with the employee covered piece being tacked onto gross wages [W2 box 1], correct? If this isn’t correct, is there a way for me to calculate what portion was paid by employer vs employee if they strayed from 50/50 split?

We kept gettin suggestions to just wait let them all fall off in 2 years.

Anyways, we have a car note of $11,000 (2018 honda civic with 17k miles right now, we bought it brand new 2 years ago and my wife only drives it to and from work ever since we bought it) and another car note for $13,500 (2013 honda pilot with 74k miles right now, we bought it used at 47k miles). 

The Honda Pilot started off at $31,500 and the Honda civic started off at $29,000. We didn't put any down payments on both.

Both of our car is under my parents in laws names they both have 820+ credit so one is 2.8% interest and the other is 3.3%

We have a savings of about $21,000 and we have two kids while living under my inlaws house for the past 4 years rent free. Paid off $30,000 of my wife and I's combined student loans over the past 4 years so no other debts except the charge offs/collections and car payments.

We are thinking of just paying off one of our cars. Should we just pay it off or pay most of our charge offs or keep our savings? 

Also, we are planning to eventually purchase our own home in the next few years and i heard that even if all of our charge offs fall off in 2 years, mortgage lenders can find a way to see those charge off/collection accounts from a certain type of FICO scoring/credit check and that they would tell us to pay them all off first before we can get approved for a home loan, is that true?

We have been living under my parents in laws house rent free for the past 4 years, but we have been paying all of the utilities in the house for 4 years and the car payments so those are basically the only bills we have.

My wife and I was pretty immature and irresponsible with money a couple years back and instead of saving more, we tend to go on these out of town trips, mini vacations to disneyland, disneyworld, vegas and other places in what seems like every other month. So, there's where all those extra money that we could've put in our savings, anyways ever since last year, we have been more tight with money.

I have a question about the student loan forbearance that was passed today.  I have just under 10k in debt and if I keep paying my student loans I can be done in around 2.5 years at the same $400 a month payments.  I have also heard about the possibility of loan forgiveness from the Biden administration and that was around 10k.  So my question is, should I continue paying the $400 a month that I can make or should I take advantage to save money and if the loan forgiveness goes into affect, then I will have all the debt gone.  My concern today is if I make payments from now till September, it is interest free.  So if I were to hold off on paying them for these remaining 8 months, I would still have the same amount and then continue paying it with the same interest.  I am just lost on where to go with the forbearance and the possibility of forgiveness in the future.  Thanks to all that have read.

193,First year filing taxes as a married couple— Roth IRA question.,"Hi there,

My husband and I are filing taxes this year as a married couple. I’ve always been responsible with my finances, but he had to do some major clean up these last few years to clear his debt and start contributing to his retirement. He finally became debt free in December of 2020, and now he’s ready to start tackling his 401k because unfortunately, his company does not offer any kind of retirement plan and his parents never taught him the importance of it. So he’s gone most of his whole life (40 years) without planning for retirement, which sucks a ton. But I’m glad he’s doing something about it now!

While filing taxes today, we ran into a problem— we’re not supposed to be contributing to an Roth IRA :/  After my stock offerings at work, we make just over $206k when filed jointly and so we’re both not allowed to contribute to a Roth IRA #yikes. My husband JUST opened a Roth IRA last year and contributed $6k to it. I’m not an expert when it comes to taxes and 401ks at all. Does anyone have suggestions as to what we can do as an alternative for him? Any suggestions for hubby to start building for his retirement as well? There’s a lot of lost time to make up for!

195,What score do I trust,"I am at my wits end with this stupid arbitrary credit crap. I have had issues with my credit for going on 5 years now, but no one can seem to tell me what my issue is. 

&#x200B;

I tried applying for a mortgage about 5 years ago and my credit score was apparently below 400 and I couldn't get approved so I have spent the last 5 years going through credit counseling and monitoring and working my ass off to bring up this score. No missed payments, credit utilization isn't the best but it isn't awful (averages to be about 40% across 3 cards) and my loans in my name are actually cosigned with my wife but we do have two car payments. Then I have student loans which were supposed to begin being paid in December but with COVID going on I haven't been required to make those payments and they do not reflect as late on my report.

&#x200B;

Credit Karma is now reporting me close to 700 and Discover Credit Scorecard has me at 650. I tried applying for another mortgage and several banks are reporting me at about 350. I also applied for a credit building credit card (I know those are a trap but I figured it would at least get my utilization lower) and while I wasn't denied the agent helping recommended not going with it because she was seeing my score above 700. I checked both reports at the end of the year last year so I am probably going to order them again to verify, but in November they were accurate. Balances were a little off but there wasn't any unrecognized accounts, past due accounts, or anything major. 

&#x200B;

So here I am trying to buy a house and my credit is supposedly in good shape unless I apply for what I need. I know there is going to be small differences but we are talking almost 400 points difference between my lowest and my highest report within a month. That's pretty much the entire spectrum. Who can I talk to about this? Because no body seems to have any actual answers about credit. It's all about what goes into your credit but everyone runs their own variation of the formula to get their numbers and those numbers honestly feel meaningless. 

&#x200B;

I'm sorry this is shaping into a rant, I just don't know what else to do or where to turn. I am at my wits end here. Who can give me a credit score I can take somewhere? Who can actually give me a solid answer on my credit and not an arbitrary range?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6spow/what_score_do_i_trust/,1611826327.0,0,0,0
196,How do I ask for a pay raise give the circumstances?,"I got my review today at work and I'm not happy with it. Last year I received a 9.5% increase which was nice but there wasn't really a change in my work load from previous years. This year, I feel my responsibilities have increased quite a bit to where I have far less down time than I've had in previous years. On top of that, I fly for work so have been exposing myself to COVID without receiving hazard pay. I've repeatedly gone on business trips with as little as a days notice so I'm valuable in that regard. Also, we went through a restructuring of management which included removing the top 3 paid employees in the company. Along with removing these employees, our employee handbook has been updated this year to max out at two weeks of vacation. I'm an hourly employee who works a lot of overtime on business trips so I used to generate more than a two weeks worth of vacation in a year so I took a cut back there which I don't mind so long as I'm getting compensated for it. My job is pretty niche so it's a bit hard to compare wages apples to apples but my company suggests doctors office pay full time med-techs more than I receive and they don't perform even half the task me co-workers and I do. I've worked at the company for 5 years now and think along with everything else that I've stated, my loyalty and hard work over the years deserves more than the 6.5% increase I was given during my review today. Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful to still have a job during this pandemic but I still feel undervalued.

The only rebuttable to my argument for a higher raise is that I'm consistently late to work in the mornings. I still get my work done at the end of the day but I can see this being mentioned and I'm not entirely sure how to respond to that.

My question for you is how do I start this conversation with my boss? How high of a percentage increase is too high to ask for in a raise?

199,How do you get health insurance? How to pay out of pocket for specialty services? Medic-aid has failed me & need treatment.,"I have Medic-aid and the doctors contracted through them did nothing but cause detriment to my health. When I was in a mental health crisis several years ago they sent me to an awful facility where I got severely injured (seizure caused by negative med reaction and subsequent head trauma.) Their doctors continuously prescribed medications that had severe negative effects on me and refused to prescribe the only med I do respond to. I have a long history of serious trauma and need to get trauma counseling but their counselors would talk to me about yoga or ask me what my favorite food was or just pointless questions and then when I spoke about my trauma all they could say is oh that sounds hard... sorry. I was going without treatment and self medicating with cannabis for so long because I had given up on treatment. Then I got court ordered to stop using marijuana and recieve medical treatment so I thought I'll pool money together and pay a psych out of pocket to actually help me. This worked initially but now it turns out I need so much additional testing done, Medic-aid misdiagnosed me as schizoaffective but it turns out I have severe CPTSD, display symptoms of brain injury and do not have any features of a psychotic disorder at all. Because I require so much additional care, medical case management as the psych called it, and I'm paying out of pocket, the psych doesn't want me around anymore and is telling me I need to transfer back to Medic-aid. I can't go back to Medic-aid. They refuse prescribe me the medication I have been paying this psych out of pocket for, they won't do proper trauma counseling with me, I don't know what to do. I could try and buy ""real"" health insurance and use every last penny I have to pay the expenses. The issue is I make $400 a month, I have no credit, and I live in a homeless shelter. What am I supposed to do? If I somehow gathered the money to buy health insurance would an insurance company even accept a person like me who has no credit and extremely low income? My other option is look for another psych to pay out of pocket and wait to see if they will work with me on the medical case management or try and force me back into Medic-aid. I am so lost on what to do and what's worse is I'm already chemically dependant on the medication, I have to figure something out fast before my current psych drops me and I'm left with no prescription and no medical treatment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6sg5d/how_do_you_get_health_insurance_how_to_pay_out_of/,1611825204.0,0,0,0

I’m having my first kid this upcoming August so I want a newer vehicle suitable for transporting a baby.

My income is $2,400 per month after taxes and my current expenses are around $2,100 which leaves me only $300 of breathing room not accounting for monthly baby supplies. I do have the ability to make a minimum of $300 to a max of $600 per month doing side gigs on my days off, but I don’t know if I should depend on that income since it’s not like my job which is guaranteed.

207,"Possibly staying home with baby 1st year, spouse the 2nd year - what considerations should be factored?","My spouse and I will be trying for a baby within the next few months, and I need to figure out what's financially feasible. With some traumatic experiences in our past, we really want to try to stay home with the baby at least its first two years. Although it seems doable/financially feasible (albeit tight!), I wanted to know if I'm missing any other considerations? 

As my spouse also plans to take off a year (after me), his savings/budgeting is not included. I know he'll have enough saved to take off the full year, though that will also be tight for him too. I want to see if I can take off a year on my own merit, as I know he can on his.

**Current situation**: I make $3500/month after taxes/retirement deductions (15%). I have a job that provides a pension, so I feel comfortable pausing my retirement contributions for the year I take off.

*Savings:* $11,000, and I save $1,000/month  
*Debt:* $5,000 (student loans), which I pay $250/month (currently I'm putting the money in an account that earns 1.5% interest during the interest free period)

**Bills:**  
*Rent:* $810/month  
*Consistent, non-negotiable bills:* (phone, insurance, utilities, etc.): $750/month  
*Realistic spending money*: $200/month  
Total: $1,760

Maternity leave:

My job offers 50% pay for up to six months (if there are complications, otherwise generally only 6-8 weeks is granted) for maternity leave. Considering I'd be pausing my retirement benefits, my incomes would be approximately $2,100/month, for a likely maximum of 2 months. I also have/will have 12 weeks of leave saved up (possibly 17 weeks--long story) which I can space out as I see fit. By the time I have the baby (barring no complications/emergencies), I should have a total of $23,000 saved. Although I'd love not to tap into all of it, it seems like I probably would.   
My current thoughts on taking 52 weeks off are as follows:

Weeks 1-8 receive $2,100/month (employer's maternity leave program)  
Weeks 9-20 receive $2,100/month (using time off at 50% for 24 weeks--possibly up to 34 weeks)  
Weeks 21-52 spend $2,100/month of savings (totals $16,275 of my $23,000 in savings)

My spouse and I are pretty environmentally friendly, and we hope to use 100% cloth diapers (used) and purchase used baby items for everything except the car seat and items that aren't safe/sanitary to purchase used. We already do most of our cooking at home, and with me being home (even with a newborn), we don't imagine our dining out expenses will increase significantly. There is also the possibility of earning some money on the side, as my sister is also trying to get pregnant and I may babysit 1-2 days/week (probably not until after the first 4-6 months). 

The baby would get added to my healthcare, which increases premiums $60 (just my portion, my spouse pays the other $60). My healthcare is extremely good and it's expected that I will not have any significant medical bills from childbirth. 

Is there anything else I need to consider/be mindful of? Is this just wishful thinking, or does it seem relatively doable to others? I appreciate any feedback you have to offer.

214,Need advice choosing mutual fund for IRA Roth account,"I just opened a Roth IRA account this past December and dropped $2,700 into it. I've been researching on how to invest it and am starting to wrap my head around it. I settled on a some kind of mutual fund. I want it to be hands off, just max out my IRA contributions every year and not have to worry about it. I also considered maybe an index fund instead because I'll have less money taken out of my earnings but figured mutual fund is better because its actively managed.

I thought about putting it into a target date fund but already have one through my employer. Don't know if it makes sense to invest in another different TDF. 

This is the mutual fund I'm thinking about and the reasons why I'm considering it but I am also open to other suggestions.

**Vanguard STAR Fund (VGSTX)**

[**https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/vgstx**](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/vgstx)

\-The minimum investment on some other funds started at $3,00 and STAR was one of the few I found that I can actually invest into. I can't contribute any more to the IRA account right now because I am currently unemployed. 

\-Its 60% stocks, 40% funds and listed as moderate risk potential. I am open to investing in another riskier mutual fund since I don't plan on touching the money anytime soon. I have another 30 years before I retire.

I feel like I'm ahead of schedule for retirement, since I already have a year's salary saved and am projected to be set by 60. On the other hand, everyone stresses how important early investments are and I don't want to be cursing myself 20 years from now for not putting away more when I could.

Im in the process of opening up a LLC for my photography business, which should make it a little bit easier to separate my accounts. 

So the questions I have are, I like to be organized, and thats what I seem to be struggling with. Where would you recommend putting my money to keep it organized?

So once I go to the dealership negotiate a price and sign the contract I have to call an insurance company then buy insurance for a car I don't own yet then go to the CU then finalize loan?

Coming from an impoverished family, I was determined to not continue this generational poverty, so I attended a four-year university and attained my degree. This was entirely self-funded, and working relentlessly while continuing my education elongated my time at the university more than anticipated. I graduated at 24. Immediately following college, I found that potential employers were reluctant (to say the least) to even grant me interviews without professional work experience or a Master's degree. I was stuck as a supervisor at my mediocre college job for eight months following graduation. I finally was hired on with a reputable company earning livable pay in early 2020. However, that only lasted five months before the consequences of the pandemic resulted in my lay off. I was unemployed for a month and a half before I had no choice but to return to my small hometown to accept a typically low-paying, unstable job in the restaurant industry. I'm now lucky if I gross $1,200 a month. With sparse job opportunity in my surrounding area, I have had no choice but to live a nomadic couch surfing lifestyle for months, which is obviously quite humiliating. I would love to relocate in search of an area with more opportunity for me to thrive, but my financial reserves have run dry and I have no resources to draw upon (or even a cosigner) to aid me if I even find an affordable place to live.

My financial details:

\-Amassed nearly $28K in student loan debt attaining my degree.

\-Currently owe $14k on a car loan ( ≈ $400/month)

\-Approx. $5,000 in credit card debt (now in collections)

\-Approx. $1,600 in medical debt (also now in collections)

\-Credit score fallen to about 480

Going into college, I felt immensely confident that I had a bright future. My credit score was damn near perfect and my ambitions were serving me well. In just a few years, it feels as though all is now in shambles. With this towering deficit attached to my name and my reliably low earnings, I am exhausted attempting to survive financially day to day.

That will also move me into Roth phase-out territory, and I was below that MAGI threshold  before. The phase out table says I can contribute $3,600 to Roth, based on my rough estimate.

In previous years, I have maxed out my Roth IRA and would like to do that this year via [Backdoor Roth conversion](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/dn6p4w/backdoor_roth_ira_conversion_with_existing/). The trouble is, I have already contributed $400 to my Roth IRA for 2021. Normally, I do weekly $100 contributions to DCA and make up the difference to the yearly max when I get my tax refund. 

Here are the accounts I currently hold:

* Traditional IRA at Vanguard from old 401(k) rollovers
* Roth IRA at Vanguard
* Solo 401(k) at E\*Trade (worked freelance 2018-19 and opened this myself)
* Company 401(k) with Voya at current job

As I understand it, my best move would be to roll the Traditional IRA into my E\*Trade 401(k), as it offers no-fee Vanguard ETFs and mutual funds. Voya does not. 

The steps seem to be this:

* Roll Traditional IRA into E\*Trade 401(k)
* Max out Traditional IRA
* Convert Traditional to Roth 
* DCA weekly

After I roll over the current balance elsewhere, can I just contribute $5,600 to my Traditional and convert without issue?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6jlz0/help_with_backdoor_roth_after_already_making_roth/,1611795288.0,3,3,0
242,Debt collectors keep passing a debt around so it appears to be opened recently -- messing up my credit. What can I do about that?,"I have this apparent medical debt that went to collections back in 2019. It's for a bill I paid in full to a hospital, but they are saying it could be the physician's bill. However, I was never sent a bill for that, and didn't even know such a thing existed until it popped up in collections and I called about it. I even called the hospital the first time it showed up and they said the company isn't their collections people, so it could be a scam -- hence I never went further with it.

I've been reporting it to the credit bureaus whenever it pops up and they eventually remove it, but then it just pops up again under a different company a few months later. So I'm curious if there's a more permanent way to deal with it.

I just called the most recent company and asked them to send me verification, which they said will take 6 weeks (to send a letter 2 states...)

The main problem is that whenever it pops up in the credit bureau sites, the ""Opened"" date is about 2 months prior. It doesn't show the original date which would be almost 3 years ago by now, so there are a few things I'm curious about:

1. Does this new ""Opened"" date count as if the start of the collections was on that date? I got the notification letter on Jan. 22, it's postmarked for Jan. 5th, but my credit report says the account was opened on Dec. 3rd. 2020.

2. If so, does that affect how long it can stay on my credit report according to the statute of limitations?

3. Is there anything I can actually do about it?

249,Car insurance charges after cancellation,"Hey r/personalfinance ,

Tl;dr. First generation immigrant mother has been paying for two car insurance even though she has claimed to cancel her old one when she switched to her new insurance company. 


for privacy reasons I am using a burner. 


Context: My mother is old school and doesn’t trust using the internet for banking as she believes it is easier to get your money stolen when using online banking. 

After literal years of convincing and talking, she finally caved and allowed me to download her bank’s mobile app and set her account up. 


Upon signing in, i notice that she was charged for an insurance company after knowing she had switched to a new insurance company, so I ask her why she was being charged for it?

thus comes the dilemma and stress that had pushed me to post and ask for advice as I am not knowledgeable in what to do. (21m) 

So, apparently from 2019, until now, she has been paying for two insurance companies. I asked her how come she never noticed money being taken out, but she said she makes deposit from her paycheck and thought it was toll charges/ utility bill payments. 

I know that this is a shot in the dark, and I know this entire post sounds stupid bc “why didn’t she check the bank statement” or other very obvious questions to ask.

251,Is it unfair to make the much larger rooms pay more?,"So my friends and I are getting an 8 bedroom house next year, in a prime location for school, like literally across the street. The issue is, theres a MAJOR difference between the size of the large rooms & the small rooms. Keep in mind rooms have NOT been officially assigned yet and we still need 2-3 more ppl so we have medium room and two small rooms that are available. With 7 ppl, rent equally split would be $628 and with 8 it would be $550 equally split.

The 4 large rooms are around 10x16, the 2 small rooms are 9x8, and the medium rooms are in-between. I suggested that the 4 large rooms should pay $25 extra if we do 7 people in the house, which would allow us to drop the price of the small room to $528 and the large rooms would pay $653 and the medium rooms would pay $628. I then suggested if we do 8 people then we charge the large rooms pay $50 extra so the small rooms would pay $450, the large rooms would pay $600, and the medium rooms would pay $550.

Suggesting this caused a huge disagreement between her and I, I said it was extremely unfair to charge the small rooms the same price as someone who has a room double the size. She has claimed a large room currently. She said it was unfair and not worth it to pay $653 plus utilities a month for the house and that she would only do it if we have 8 people, she said it was not something she was willing to do with 7. Personally I think it is extremely unfair and you're basically scamming your roommate by making them pay the same exact price as 4 other people in the house who have more than double the size of a room. Ugh I just don't know what to do, I'm not sure if anyone will want to move into a 9x8 room if we don't drop the price to make it worth it and if nobody moves into at least one of the small rooms, we're kind of screwed",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6glwc/is_it_unfair_to_make_the_much_larger_rooms_pay/,1611787484.0,3,3,0

253,Medical Bill after max out of pocket,"Bear with me here.

My daughter has a rare genetic condition in which she cannot digest protein appropriately. She regularly has trailing medical bills because it takes all the systems awhile to catch up, and she usually meets her max out of pocket on our plan early in the year.

One of the things we do is order medical prescription food (like low protein flour and pasta etc). As you can imagine there are very few companies who provide this service so they have to get permission to be treated as in network for insurance. In 2018 we paid 20% until the max out of pocket was met and then food the rest of the year was covered 100%. Now for 2019 they are telling me that I owe over $500 even though we met our Max out of pocket in March of that year (before those orders were placed). The company (Cambrooke) states they weren’t paid. The insurance (BCBS TX) states that although they accept them in order to pay them they don’t have an in network contract with them and therefore it’s cambrooke’s fault if they don’t agree to what BCBS is willing to pay. 

What the heck happened?

Nothing about my plan changed and no one can give me answers as to why in 2018 this was fully covered and in 2019 it’s not despite zero plan changes.

She is in year 2 of paying $3342 a year which is to go on until year 20. She can withdraw at anytime before or after 20 years, but once withdrawn it voids the whole insurance policy. Should we still keep the plan or let it go?

The critical illness portion will give her 155k-174k for the first critical illness, and then 96k for the second and third critical illnesses.

The life insurance will give out 180k the first 10 years then 120k after that.

So, my assets if paid today equal around 50k immediately, with 10-25k expected in next 30 days, and cost of car is 25k plus gas (repairs are under warranty for new car) and I believe my parents would support the insurance on their plan.

Age: 37

401k: 55K. It's 5 years old. I contribute the max my employer matches which is 6%.

Personal stock: 90k

I live in an area where any home worth buying is going to be at least a million, so pulling some money out of my stocks and buying a house isn't going to be on the table in the near future. Not looking to move either so I'm just considering home buying to be out of this equation. Yes there are more affordable options in adjacent areas, but at this point in my life I'd rather rent in an enjoyable area to live than move somewhere less desirable just to own something. My rent is $1950 a month, so its not like i'm pissing away 4k every month on some huge lavish apartment. 

While having a substantial rainy day fund is great for peace of mind, I can't help but feel I shouldn't let this amount of money sit there doing nothing. However, I'm hesitant to move more into the stock market and it's really not enough to do a whole lot with as far as real estate purchases. I'm only hesitant because all my other forms of savings are in stocks, and not sure if that's a smart move. Maybe it's exactly what I should be doing. 

Any advice or ideas for what to do with this? Are CDs still a thing? Should I buy more stock? Should I just keep adding to it and increase my safety net? I'm putting away about 1.5k a month right now.

265,Buy the duplex we're currently renting? Its got a bad roof...,"My partner and I have been living in a duplex for 8 years. It's a 2 bedroom with a back yard and garage. We like it here. We live in an economically depressed area, a rough neighborhood (our street is nice)  and have been paying 450 a month for rent, water included. We've been lucky. 

The other half of the duplex has just opened up (1 bedroom 1 bath, we would then also have exclusive access to basement, laundry, 2 car garage) we have been considering renting it as a studio as we're both artist and musicians. This would raise our rent by 350, and require us to pay water and do our own yard work, (effectively double our rent) which we can technically afford and wouldn't mind.  We didn't plan to move out for several years, barring unforseen circumstances. So we would be paying much more than we would on rent than a loan would cost.  And don't really want to gamble with new neighbors, being in the low rent bad neighborhood, it has historically been addicts, some good, some bad. The cost does seem high, but we understand that he could easily get another tenant to fill the duplex. 

When telling our land lord we were interested, he offered to sell us the place for $25,000. (Or 31.5 months of combined rent for both units) I initially was very excited, but upon doing some research, I am concerned about the homes roof. It's no secret that It needs to be replaced, and has been leaking for years. I plan to get an estimate on the roof, but have a feeling it will be quite pricey. Its a very old home 1904 (beautiful) but may have other issues too.

The cost is so low, that we may have to pay with a personal loan should we choose to buy. My biggest concern is that we get the house, and can't sell it when it's time to move on. Or that the repairs on the roof won't save the bones of our home. 

The smaller house across the street just sold for $62,000, houses nearby that are smaller are going for about 22-45,000. But they look like decent roofs (Google maps Arial view?) zillow says the house is worth 22000 to 53000, but assume they don't know about the roof)

Should i buy it for the sake of having my money go toward something instead of into the void of renting? Pay double rent and stay for a year or two, unable to save as effectively? ...or continue to rent our single unit without having to worry about reselling one day, but also roll the dice again with shitty neighbors.

So here’s what’s going on. Last March, my dad bought me a Toyota Corolla that after all of the dealer shit bullshit ended up being about $27,000. Unfortunately, my dads credit score is pretty bad, and we ended up with nearly a 15% interest rates with monthly payments on a 72 month loan being around $515. Since the car is about a year old, we were looking at refinancing, but his credit score hasn’t improved much. I’ve since turned 18 and have established my own credit score of around 650.

Here’s my question, would it be better to attempt and refinance, or trade in the car for a new one at the same price (The value of the car is about $15,000) and have me co-sign with him so that we could get a lower interest rate and lower monthly payments while also taking on what’s still owed for the first car? 

I don’t have much experience with finances so anything so any help is appreciated!

Apologies for the throwaway and obfuscation, I just want to make sure I remain anonymous. 

I have a degree in a relatively high stress field. I worked in the industry for this field for eight years and hated it from day one - like, came home from work on my first day and cried at the dinner table, hated it. But I was/am good at it. I left the industry because it was just too stressful and I hated it. 

Three years ago I left the industry side and got into writing content ABOUT the industry instead of actually working in the industry, and I love it. I love my job, I love the people I work with, I love the company. It pays well enough for my single income to let me and my family live perfectly comfortably on my salary (115k-ish) alone, though my wife does work part time.

I don’t really know what to think about it. Would I be stupid to take it because I know I would hate it? Or would I be stupid not to take it because the money is so good?

I was looking into starting a personal investment account as an addition to my subscription (for $3 a month for both accounts) but then i ran into all these issues with my account on the app. It said I didn't have an account and need to contact customer service. I contacted them but they have consistently blew me off and my problem is still not resolved after about 2-3 weeks. It is making me considering moving my Roth IRA to a different, safer investment app. The cost for moving to another broker is about $75.

The more i look into it though....all the customer service on these apps...robinhood, acorn etc. look horrible? I mean, will this be safe in the future? It all feels sketchy to me. 

What is a secure company with good customer service where I could open a Roth IRA & personal investment account for a low amount of money & low monthly cost? Has anyone used Ameritrade or Vanguard?  Should I just stick with Stash until I have more funds to move it into a better account?

I still live at home but for most of my life my home environment is terrible. I live with a toxic parent who doesn't realize the mental toll they cause on my siblings and I. 
I know the easiest thing to say is ""get a job"" but this parent expects to take some of this paycheck if I do get income ( which would make it hard to save money) , plus it's easier said than done, I also don't have a personal car of my own anymore since one of my parents took the car that my grandmother gave as a gift to my siblings and I, plus it's not in our name anyways. I'm not asking for money but I'm asking really like what are my options, I probably only have a few dollars to my name, I don't have friends or family who are will in take me in. I just kind of wait and wait for a day that maybe could make it better but I've been waiting for years to get out. It's not a physically abusive place, more so very controlling and sometimes what they say takes a big mental toll on my siblings and I because of personal jabs/ comments they make and lack of real parenting and I just think it's about time to get out of here. Maybe leaving would build a better relationship. 
This parent also has taken financial aid money from me and loan money but they said they'd pay back the loan money when I'm done with college. If anyone can think of anything that I can do to start earning income and move out it would help out a lot, and maybe it could help out others who are in my situation too.

279,Shady Chase Savings Account Practice,"I just wanted to relay my experience with a newly opened Chase Savings account.

At the end of December I opened a Chase Savings account as they had a $150 sign-up bonus promotion and interest rates have been so low I figured why not?  To receive the bonus you have to maintain a $10,000 minimum balance throughout the 90 day window to receive the bonus.  I transferred exactly $10,000 in, fees would be waived as long as $300 minimum was kept in the savings account and figured I would be golden to just let the money sit there for 3 months.

Today I checked my account and noticed the balance had dropped under $10,000 so I am no longer eligible for the sign-up bonus.  Why did it drop under $10,000?  Because when I opened the account my balance was $0 as my transfer into the account was still pending at that time and I was hit with a monthly fee since I did not maintain a minimum of $300 in the account.  

Obviously not the end of the world, but seems a bit ridiculous that I have to pay a monthly fee and that snowballed into me losing the bonus.  Maybe an oversight on my part to not consider the time prior to my initial funds being deposited, but still a bit frustrating.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6ew70/shady_chase_savings_account_practice/,1611783147.0,4,4,0

I understand there is a shortage since we purchased our home in 2019 and this was the first time our taxes increased (2019 was 6700; 2020 was 9300). But the PMI Issue seems very off, and the fact that they are calculating the shortage off the $908 and then asking me to pay either the 10k up front or over the next 60 months is insane. Thoughts?

&#x200B;

Income takehome: 5600/mo from me and 2200 from wife.

Investments: I full match my 401K - 8 percent of my income for 6 percent match. Wife gets pension plus a small amount of 401K. We currently dont put any EXTRA towards any IRA or other investments.

Bills - home: 1400/mo barely refinanced last year when rates dropped, so 29.5 years remaining

car1: 600 month honda accord - only 12K remaining, only 30K miles on it.

car2: 700 month toyota 4runner - 30K remaining, just hit 10K miles. (We had a paid off hyundai accent, but I hit a deer and totalled it, otherwise we weren't going to get another car until the honda was paid off)

insurance: 120/mo

petrol: 150-200/mo

HOA/sewer/garbage: 100/mo

gas/power:150/mo

Groceries: 500/mo feeding me/wife/one kid

medical: 200 (150 chiropractor, 50 to baby doctor) - these are upfront payments to keep balances at 0.

Fun: 500-1000 

Phone: 200 (2 ipad lines, 2 phone lines)

&#x200B;

Credit cards: (I know these are high, but we used them to get my wife through college, so it should pay off eventually) All CCs are within like 1-2 percent interest of each other

Amex: 20K balance - 600 payment, 300 goes to interest

Citi - 10K balance - 300 payment, 150 to interest

Local Credit Union - 10K balance - 300 payment, 150 interest

&#x200B;

Adding all these up I get about 6000 outgoing and 7800 incoming. I am using about 1000 extra each month for getting credit card payments down (I was at 50K in cc's last July), and the remainder we use for things like christmas and vacations.

285,Approaching collection agencies before credit report impacted.," Hello,

I was recently billed by a car rental company in December who stated I had 60 days to contest if I felt the bill was in error. Since I believed this to be in error (they billed me for services that I never signed up for), I wrote them a letter per their guidance for how to contest the bill. However, despite their 60 day window to contest, they sent to collections on the 31st day (January 15th), which I just learned today. They told me the name of the collections agency.

I have not received any correspondence from the collections agency. And, I ran a credit report online and saw no collections have hit my report yet.

Based on my research, the most common way to prevent collections from hitting your credit report is to write the collections agency requesting a ""pay for delete"", or to send a goodwill letter to ask the credit agencies to disregard the collection.

In this case, since the collection hasn't hit my credit report yet, do you recommend I reach out to the collections agency to try and arrange to pay before it's reported? Or is that not how the situation works? Basically, I'm wondering if it's advisable that I be proactive since it hasn't hit my credit report yet.

286,Rent vs Buy a condo - for 2 years?,"Hey all,

I am an engineer on work-visa from SanDiego. I've been renting and sharing a 2b2b for 1100$+utilities for a year and a half.

I am thinking of buying a 2b2b condo around 450K$ this fall, live there in one room while house hack the other room. My idea is to direct my rent to an asset instead of draining it.

However, I do not have 20% downpayment. I'd be able to set aside, 5% for downpayment (\~25k$) + 10k$ closing costs, while keeping 10k$ in emergency funds at the time of closing. So mortgage cost comes close to 2600-2800$ including PMI and HOA. I am planning to rent one room for 1200$ and pay rest of mortgage(1600$) as of 2021.

Also, I'd like to move out after 2 years, if needed (anticipating job change or marriage), and be able to rent it out for about 3 more years before considering to sell it. I also plan to keep saving around 1%(every year for maintenance) + anticipate 15,000$ worth of HOA assessments or such emergencies over the 5 year period and keep saving for it.

I've personally tried to run some numbers including the downpayment, closing costs, selling costs for selling after 2/5 years. Worst case, after 2 years, I might incur a loss of 20-30k, which I would anyways lose when renting. Best-case, I get back 30-40k$ tax-free due to using my house as primary residence for 2 years, and even more if favorable appreciation.

So, given I find a condo with a good HOA, should I go with my plan ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6gwpd/rent_vs_buy_a_condo_for_2_years/,1611788287.0,3,3,0

299,Help in how can I invest a settlement money!?,"Greetings,

Hope everybody is doing great. I am feeling overwhelmed looking for information about how can I take care of a money that me and my wife received in a settlement. I have to be honest that I am really bad with investing and understanding everything involved in this environment. I have received some advices but I can't get the picture of what are the steps in doing this properly to get retirement early. 

I am 36 my wife is 31. Making 50k annually, no debts, renting a house with two kids. My employer is paying my 401k. We have 240k from a settlement and from that money I started investing in stocks. I have planned to open some emergency funds accounts and a house down payment account. The rest of the money will be for investing with the plan for retirement early, probably in 20 years. 21k will be in 6 month emergency fund account and we are not going to touch that money. 3k in another emergency fund if something occur and 25k for a house down payment and probably 15k for medical expenses if something happens. We will have 176k left for investing. We don't have to pay taxes of that money, thanks God.

I have been reading here and there a little bit but honestly I feel like if is more complicated than in reality is. But some of the suggestions that I have received are to open an Roth IRA, open a Brokerage account and put more money into the 401k. The 50k annually is just enough for the living expenses and I can't put more into the account. Just I want to use the settlement money wisely and let it growing over the time.  

My question is how can I do the investment. What are the steps to do this, the sequence or order in opening each one. Can we Open the Brokerage account first with 176k in 1 to 3 index funds and then, pull out the annual contribution for the Roth IRA annually? Or do we have to do the opposite?. How we are going to pay the taxes if we do this?. I know that for the Roth we have to pay taxes over the contribution. But if we take money out of the brokerage account, do we have to pay taxes over the gains, and then, pay more taxes when we add the funds to the Roth IRA?. Or just opening a brokerage account with  ETFs or index funds with 176k and let it grow maybe adding a couple of hundreds throughout the year?. 

What would be the best option to pay less taxes?. This post contain to much information. I apologise because I am still feeling overwhelmed. What I don't want to do is waste the money taking the wrong steps or taking bad decisions.

300,Seeking perspectives and thoughts regarding primary residence options in retirement,"Warning: long context; but appreciate your perspectives regarding pros and cons of my options being considered for residency...

Fortunate to be in a position to have some options to consider regarding location of primary residence in retirement, and whether to have more than one house in different states, but struggling to figure out what is the best course to pursue. Here is some context, the options under consideration, tax implications, and the questions I have that I'd appreciate your thoughts/perspective on for those who have experience with these options...

Context:

* Married, 56, wife couple years younger
* Live in MCOL area of CA; 15 year mortgage is $1850/mo; $400K equity - not our preferred ""forever"" home location, but near SF Bay area...not our favorite climate
* Land worth $250k (no mortgage) generating income of $13k/yr
* Net worth closing in on $5M; $2.6M in brokerage accounts; $1.4M in retirement accounts; 
* Current expenses: $100k/yr ($68K non-discretionary, $30K discretionary in a normal year; less this year for obvious reasons)
* Income: $200k+ salary & bonuses 

Goals:

* Retire in 1-3 years
* Minimize taxes in retirement (income/sales/property/estate) 
* Prefer to live in Portland, OR area (possibly Vancouver, WA) for family/friend/climate reasons; but need to maintain primary residence outside OR or WA (mainly for estate tax reasons); have family reasons to have a base in or near SF Bay Area also
* Would like to not overly complicate our living situation
* Like to travel internationally 2-3 times a year, or one longer trip (so proximity to airports important)

Residence options considered, along with pros and cons (at least that I see):

1. Sell current place, buy into the HCOL Bay Area; forget Portland.
   1. Pros - Simplest situation; close to some family, excellent climate, no estate tax issues
   2. Cons - Most expensive option tax-wise (income/sales/property) to buy a place accceptable for our ""forever"" home; no base in PDX to enjoy climate, family, friends,
2. Keep current place as primary residency (estate tax reasons), buy 2nd home in PDX area  (it would not be rented out) that we live in most of the year.
   1. Pros - Allows us to split time with family and friends in both places, enjoy climate in PDX, closer to activities/shopping, etc. in PDX than current home in CA., no estate tax issues
   2. Cons - 2nd most expensive option tax-wise, complicates living situation (maintaining 2 homes), higher overall living costs than having one home; requires a bit more saving, so I'd need to work an additional couple of years
3. Sell current place, buy place in Portland and Las Vegas area (NV would be primary for tax reasons); spend most of our time in PDX
   1. Pros - Least expensive multi-home option tax-wise, lots of activities/shopping in both cities, enjoy climate in PDX, no income tax, no estate tax issues
   2. Cons - No base to stay at for longer periods of time to visit family/friends in SF bay area, complicates living situation (maintaining 2 homes), higher overall living costs than having one home; requires a bit more saving, so I'd need to work an additional couple of years.
4. Sell current place, just buy in PDX area
   1. Pros - Simple solution, close to some friends/family, closer to activities/shopping than current home, more suitable climate
   2. Cons - No base to stay at for longer periods of time to visit family/friends in SF bay area, BRUTAL estate tax implications, 3rd most expensive option (but mitigated if we moved to Vancouver, WA, with no state income tax but still a brutal estate tax).
5. Forget PDX; keep current place and buy 2nd home in Las Vegas
   1. Pros - No income tax, no estate tax issues; homes in LV are less expensive for what we'd need.
   2. Cons - No base in PDX for enjoying climate, family, friends, climate sucks, complicates living situation (maintaining 2 homes), higher overall living costs than having one home

My questions, and I'm hoping for some awesome insights, suggestions, and perspectives from those who have faced this type of dilemma:

* How much of a hassle is it maintaining two homes in different states? How much additional overhead should I be expecting (I know 2 mortgages, property taxes, utilities, potential yard maintenance costs, etc.)
* Am I missing some other potentially viable option to meet my stated goals without having to work longer, estate get taxed like crazy (OR/WA estate taxes will overwhelm the amount of savings in income/sales taxes you may realize by just living there).
* Anything else we should be considering?

303,Is the commute worth the money?,"Hi all,

Just trying to get opinions on the following:

My husband works from home and makes 80k/year, I recently graduated from my training program, I am taking some time off to be at home with my toddler and also because I'm pregnant. I am going to go back to work in a a couple of months after I have my second child. I have a job contract signed a while ago that is PART-TIME 2 days a week, 9 hour days (with lunch break) and pays me 110k/year with benefits.

We have a house that we recently bought that was 330k. My parents babysit which is why we bought close to them so we have help with the children and we don't have to put them in daycare, and also obviously this financially helps.

The issue that I am facing is that my upcoming part-time job is 1.5 hour commute ONE WAY. I can get out of the job contract with minimal issues, biggest issue would be burning bridges with that employer. Although I live in a large city, there are FULL time jobs that I could get, but there are almost ZERO part time jobs. I am burned out from training and I just want to be able to spend time with my children, especially when they are so little.

I just wanted to get opinions on if you guys think a 1.5hr commute is okay given salary, and considering I am likely unable to get a part-time job closer (although I keep looking). My husband thinks that although it's a tough commute, it's only for 2 days a week, and says to just try it out, and if I hate it, to quit after 4-6 months.

As for our finances: no credit card debt, $450/month car, student loans currently deferred, $2k/month mortgage. We have about 60k in savings, we are maxing out my husband's company's matching 401k, and putting the max in for our Roth IRA, and we are contributing $200/month for our child's 529 plan.

TLDR; would a 1.5hr commute one way be worth it if the job is part time 2 days a week, pays $110/year, and there is no available part-time jobs closer?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Sorry just to be clear, it has to be ALTERNATE days I am working (not back to back days), because I am basically sharing a job with a senior member who already has alternate day schedule, so I'm taking the 2 alternate days she is not working.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6nrro/is_the_commute_worth_the_money/,1611807534.0,0,0,0
304,401 (k) Questions - Need advice.,"Apologies in advance for a very lengthy post.

Here are my questions:

1. I’ve forgotten what retirement age I entered while setting up my 401 (k) plan. How can I see/update what I added?

2. At the retirement age I added, would I be able to withdraw all of my 401 (k) funds penalty-free?

3. When I initially setup my 401 (k) plan, it was all pre-tax. I’m now moving the whole contribution to Roth. How does it impact the previous contributions I made as pre-tax?

4. I earn about $90k per year. I contribute 5% (as Roth) to my 401 (k). My employer contributes 4% (maximum that they can offer). Should I contribute at a higher percentage provided that I can still meet all of my expenses comfortably? Or should I rather put my extra savings in a Savings/Investment account and keep the 401 (k) contributions as they are?

5. As of now my 401 (k) investments fall under ‘Columbia Balanced A’ (CBLAX) at 100%. Does it matter which one(s) of the following I choose? If yes, what are best ones?

308,Help with the max budget for a car,"For context.

I'm 22 and own a home with no mortgage, and I have no debt. Although I am unemployed at the moment.

17,000 in bank.

25,000 in easily liquidatable non-retirement
portfolios.

More in roth but obviously don't want to touch.

I spend about $650 a month. This is helped due to the fact that me and the two other people I live with basically split everything down to thirds. As well as share two cars.

Another thing in mind. I have to buy a roof within the next two years which will cost me around 20k total.

So, I want to buy (or maybe lease) a reliable mid size sedan preferably. Which also has low average insurance costs.  My whole life I've been driving cars that were worth less than $2000 that broke down every two months or so which got old quick. I'm still not sure whether to buy used or new, I see many conflicting opinions. What apy is good for my situation, buy full in cash?

310,HSA Excess Contributions,"Hi all,

In my HSA account I contributed $200 over the limit in 2019 and $300 over the limit in 2020. My understanding is that the excess contributions and any of their earnings continue to be penalized at 6% indefinitely until a correction is made. My question is:

Could I just pay the penalty for 2020 and then contribute $500 under the 2021 limit? Would this stop the penalties from following me into 2021? I have most of my account in investments, but there is $1000 sitting in HSA Bank, not invested so I wonder if I could say the excess is part of that $1K and it never generated any gains.

311,"Reasonable COL, High Quality of Life for Relocation?","Hi there. My husband and I are both in school, he is working as an apprentice electrician and going for his journeyman. I have been doing my pre-reqs for nursing school and just applied! I will find out if I was accepted in February. We are going back to school at 29 and 30 to increase our earning potential after many years of restaurant and tourism work (and lots of traveling and fun too!)

We live in a high cost of living town: Moab, Utah. The wages are not very competitive and the median home price is in the $400,000s. I feel very discouraged seeing prices like that...granted we are hoping to see our incomes increase as we move along but I feel like prices like that will lock us into the rat-race for eternity!! We have also been here for a few years and I feel like there is a whole wide world out there we can still see and I don't want to get ""trapped"" here.

We are super active--we love biking, hiking, surfing, long boarding, snowboarding...basically anything outside and active we enjoy! We have really been missing the ocean, and would love to try and find a spot by the ocean in the future. If not by the ocean, we want quick and easy access to biking and hiking trails. We are bike commuters and ride our bikes to work, to the store, and to friends houses. We love to not have to drive a ton; I grew up in suburbia and do NOT miss that.

Something else that is important to us is diversity, specifically the Spanish language. My husband is an immigrant from South America and we don't have a whole lot of diversity down here in Southern Utah. We would love to find an area where there is more Spanish spoken; I think it would help my husband a lot with his homesickness.

We still have a few years before we finish our degrees, but I need to find some hopefulness right now in thinking about future possibilities. Sometimes I just get too disheartened here about ever being able to buy a home. I would love any thoughts/suggestions/recommendations for cool places we could move to in the future!

316,Question About Backdoor vs. Mega Backdoor with mix of assets and incomes,"Sorry if this has already been answered, but I haven't quite found the exact scenario when I searched.

Here's the scenario (all numbers rounded):

* Existing Traditional IRA with 20k (5k earnings), was rolled over from a company 401k
* Existing Roth IRA with 10k (3k earnings), was rolled over from a company Roth 401k
* Another existing traditional IRA with 7.5k (2k earnings)
* No current 401k program at company
* Wage income from company is too high for Roth IRA
* Also have about 15k side gig income

So the two questions I have are:

* Solo-K or SEP-IRA for my side gig income?
* If SEP-IRA, does it make sense to combine it with a backdoor Roth?
* If Solo-K, does it make sense to combine with a mega backdoor Roth? Plus a backdoor Roth for the existing IRA funds?
* Is my traditional IRA from the 401k rollover exempt from pro-rata rule from backdoor?

Edit: So I've done some more research, and it looks like it's theoretically too late for me to contribute to a 2020 Solo-K, as I did not express intent to contribute to one by 12/31/2020. I did create a SEP-IRA account and complete a declaration form before 12/31/2020, so SEP it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6n2og/question_about_backdoor_vs_mega_backdoor_with_mix/,1611805307.0,1,1,0

Time progressed with the car and issues arose with the car and our relationship. The car was repossessed, leaving me/us with the remainder of the loan in our name. Roughly, 10-11,000$.  We setup a ""payment"" plan but against our best plan of action I wasn't aware the interest was a whopping 15%. The plan we had set in action was for her to just put down 100$/mo as that's all she could rummage on her own to pay off this debt. Fast forward till now where Equifax is now reporting the debt on her credit aswell, which it hadn't been for well over year and an ""oh crap"" moment sprung up on her end and I called the agency handling our account to see what was going on, as it is no longer showing on mine as it had been. Which is how I found out about this incredibly high interest rate. Speaking with the gentleman handing our account he told me I could pay it off in full for 85% of the balance, $10,848. I obviously don't have that and neither does she otherwise I would have quashed this ASAP. I own my own home but my income alone doesn't allow me to pay toward the debt.

323,Best credit card to apply for with low credit? (US),"Hello all, thanks for clicking my post.

I had never heard of credit growing up, my parents were not good with money and were not willing to impart any information they had about finances to me growing up. When I was 18, I accrued some medical bills that I thought had been paid by my insurance, and I found out when I was joining the military that my credit score was around 400. I paid off those bills of course, and in 2020 managed to pay off about 6k of student loans. I want to be serious about my money, but unfortunately I feel a little stunted due to my upbringing.

I have 8k saved up for a car right now and all my bills are on auto-pay and I never run out of the money to pay them on time. I think I'm responsible with my finances, just clueless as to get that to come across on paper.

My credit score is only 658 right now according to credit karma, and I got auto-denied from the Chase Sapphire Reserve card when I tried to apply. I heard that applying to too many credit cards can further affect my score, so I want to be positive I apply to a credit line that will accept me.

I plan on using it to pay off some minor bills monthly. I have been using a debit card my entire adult life, and am ashamed to say I didn't know that it was different from a credit card. I'm only 22 now but I feel like I'm really fighting uphill against my bad credit, considering I can't build good credit without a credit card, and can't get a credit card without good credit.

Any advice about this would be totally appreciated. Any other unsolicited advice about what you would do in my situation is also appreciated, because I feel years behind my friends in terms of finances and I really could use some tips and advice on how to navigate financial independence, seeing as I don't speak to my parents and don't know who else to ask.

I'm in my mid 20's and have been working in a semi-lucrative job for the last  2-ish years, and am starting a new job next month, which comes with a  nice raise. Ideally I'd like some guidance on making some investments and allocating income/savings into growth opportunities.

&#x200B;

Debt: none 

* I am however considering purchasing a new car and expect a 15k down with 500/month expenses, including insurance and gas
* Car: paid for by a third party until this lease runs out, due to legal stuff 

Savings:

* 105,000-ish in a savings account (considering moving a large sum into a HYSA)
* 1,500 in a checking account
* 13,000-ish in a 401k

Rent:

* none (I live with my parents and don't foresee moving out in the next year or so)

Expenses:

* 1,300 Averaged over the last year (expenses go on my credit card which has a 1.75% - 3.75% cashback option)

Income:

* Last Year 5,080.00 monthly after taxes (which was 40.53 hourly)
* This Year 6,230.00 monthly after taxes (which will be 54.90 hourly)
* 1,000-ish monthly after taxes (from a new side gig which is new this year at 49.44 hourly)

I'd really like a little bit of guidance, to help me figure where exactly I'm going with my life in the next few years. I'd love to buy a place but the cost of the average home in my side of the country is roughly 450k so I'd like to squeeze the free rent for a while longer.

326,First year into working real job - will I ever be able to buy a house?,"Hi,

I am a 32yo teacher in Germany and started my full time teaching position about a year ago (i took a long time studying).

I always had the goal of owning a house one day so I started a special down payment program with my bank where I get a very low interest rate if I save up at least 30% of the total house cost.

I currently have a net income of 3300€/month and after a year of employment I am not sure anymore if I'll actually be able to afford a house in my lifetime without sacrificing everything else. Here is a breakdown of the situation and I'd be thankful for advice:

|net income|3300€|will go up very slowly|
|:-|:-|:-|
|rent|750€|will go down in 1 year|
|down-payment plan|500€||
|savings|300€|currently at 4k, goal is 10k|
|investing|200€|ETFs|
|utilities|150€||
|insurance |350€|necessary medical|
|subscriptions / phone / etc|100€||
|transportation|200€|car insurance, gas, bike repair, ...|
|food|250€||
|work / self improvment curses|250€||

So currently I have around 250€ left every month for entertainement, cloth etc. My job is very stressful for me so there is absolutely no chance of getting a second job ontop (I'm working around 60-70 hours / week including everything). With my position there is a pension of around 70% of my final income, so I'm not worrying about having money for retirement.

My rent / utilities is a bit high because I'm living in an appartement big enough to house me and my girlfriend who is still studing to become a teacher. In about 1 year she is going to live with me again so my rent / utilites will go down substantially by then (hopefully).

When I looked on the market I did not find any houses for less than 250k€, typically it would be more like 300k€. I currently have 18k in the down payment plan, 4k in savings and 3k in investments. So if my calculations are right I'd need at least 75k in my down payment plan, which would take around 10 years at my current savings rate. But if the housing market stays on its upward trajectory houses will be more like 350-400k (they were 200k 5 years ago).

When I got into this job I was under the impression that I had a pretty good paying profession since I'm paid a lot more than most of my friends. Is my spending too high? Is there something I did not consider? Any advice is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6ceze/first_year_into_working_real_job_will_i_ever_be/,1611776006.0,4,4,0

331,Advice on Student Loan Repayment Strategy," I am interested in hearing your opinion on my student loan repayment strategy.

Some background: I graduated college in May with $22,767 in three separate federal un-subsidized student loans. I began my job in July making $6,833 gross monthly ($4,574 after tax and 401-K contributions). I am 22, living at home, and paying my parents $400 a month for rent/utilities/food and with a plan to agressively pay off my student loan to become debt-free in order to start saving for a down payment. Interest on the loans has been frozen until at least Sept 30. Since I began paying $1200 a month in August, I have paid off $7,300, leaving me with $15,467.67. At the current rate, I will fully pay off my loan in Feb 2022, a year and a half after graduation.

My question is: Do you think this strategy is too agressive? Should I instead be putting some of the money from my loan into an additional savings/investment account/CD (especially while there is no interest accruing)? Am I doing it wrong by trying to pay down this loan which is not accruing any interest?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6m97e/advice_on_student_loan_repayment_strategy/,1611802791.0,1,1,0

337,Dealing with my deceased dad's medical debt from a hospital he shouldn't have been taken to,"I've browsed this subreddit and the debt collections wiki and haven't really seen a situation similar to this one, so I'm hoping you guys can help me out.

Long story short, my dad was a 100% disabled veteran and received free medical treatment from the VA. In 2016 he was in a car accident and he told the EMTs he needed to go to the VA, but instead they took him to a local hospital. He was there for a few hours before they transferred him, but that hospital said he owed them $15,000 and the ambulance service is claiming $1,100. He refused to pay them and said ""they can pry it from my cold, dead hands."" Well, he died in July from Covid and I've just been named the Administrator of his estate, so now it's my problem to deal with. 

The bills have been sent to collections of course, but is there any way I can fight the debt since the ambulance took him to the other hospital instead of the VA?

I'm pretty sure I've read from other posts on here that it's better for me to deal with the debt collection agency instead of the hospital and emergency services. Is that correct?

What would be a likely amount the debt collectors would settle for? Both bills were sent to the same company the total is a little over $20,000 after interest.

What is my best course of action?

This was all perfect timing as I was already expecting something important from the DMV about my license. So, in my groggy, worried state, I mindlessly clicked on the link, entered my name, address, social and email into the website and clicked submit. It was in that moment I realized what I had just done. 

What I did: After having the freak out of my life, I promptly called the FTC to file a report that my information had been compromised. Then I called the 3 major credit unions to freeze my credit. Lastly I changed my passwords. 

What I tried to do: I called the police department to file a report, but since a crime has not been committed yet, there was nothing to report. I also called the IRS, and likewise, since a crime has not been committed there's nothing they could do. 

To my knowledge, these are all the steps I can take. 
But who knows if I'm forgetting a crucial step here. I was about to finance a truck, so this couldn't happen at a worse time. 

So here are my questions: 
Have I done everything I can? How long should I keep fraud alerts for my accounts once I unfreeze them? How often do you have to renew these fraud alerts? How long will this affect me, and will I have to live the rest of my life worried that someone is waiting to use my SSN? What else should I look out for moving forward (financing a car, opening an account, buying a house, etc)?

I'm in my mid 20s, and ignorant regarding most things finance, so any info about this is appreciated.

I still have both of my jobs through the pandemic (one full-time and part-time). I plan to live abroad this year in the late summer/early fall when covid no longer becomes a problem (hopefully). I've saved up more than enough money for this since covid delayed it.

So my brother (moved back in a year ago) is in the navy (reserves) and has Navy Federal and he wanted me to become a member at Navy Federal too (I'm not a veteran). So he sponsored me and I got a debit and credit card there. 

My brother still owes me $400 and when I reminded him that, he thought that getting me navy federal would settle it and that was a part of the deal. I don't think he made that clear enough to me. I didn't look at it that way. Then he said 'I suppose I can pay you back' in a reluctant way. Later, Navy Federal noticed that I don't have an car insurance and called my brother telling me that I need to have it since we live in the same household. My brother told me to get the cheapest liability, it will only be $50.

My brother thinks Navy Federal is the shit. He thinks that it's the best thing he can give to me. I believe him but I don't know how good. Is it really worth having Navy Federal? I honestly would rather not have it if I didn't have to pay for insurance that I don't use but I don't want to be too cheap where some day down the road I miss out on something good like good rates just because I didn't feel like paying a little money.

I live in Florida, but I'm visiting my parents/family long-term in Indiana during the pandemic. During my visit, I rolled over two traditional 401(k) accounts from former employers to a newly created Roth IRA.

The former administrators required that physical checks be sent to me and then I would send the checks to the administrator of the IRA. This is where the mistake was made. Instead of doing what I should have done (call the former administrators and ask them to mail the checks to Indiana but keep my Florida address on the checks), I changed my address to my parents' with the administrators and then the Indiana address ended up on the check.

I didn't think anything of it at the time. But I was recently issued my 1099-R's from these administrators and although my address on the form is in Florida, the local state distribution lists Indiana. I called the administrators to see if they could retroactively correct this, and they told me to talk to my tax professional.

I have no tax presence in Indiana and I will not be paying any Indiana taxes, but I'm sure this information was reported to them, and I want to make sure I handle this situation correctly so their tax department doesn't come knocking on my door. I typically file my taxes by myself to keep costs to a minimum. I tried to find a solution online but came up empty.

QUESTION:
Is this a matter worth consulting/paying a tax professional for, or does anyone out there have advice on how to correct this situation?

EDIT: I'm mainly worried that there is an amount in Box 16: https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099r.pdf

353,"Trying to buy a home from my mother with a considerable gift of equity, and a lot of student debt","Hi, I don’t know if this is doable, but it’s getting down to the wire and I’m about to be, if not am already, priced out of ever being a homeowner in my city. I appreciate any help you all can offer. 

My mom owns the house I am living in, and she wants to sell it to me and split the proceeds of the sale between my brother and myself. She is being incredibly generous and sees this as the only way to help my fiancé and I own a home in Austin. She just basically wants to give my brother and I our inheritance before she dies. 

I am currently on salary making $48k at my dream job, and leaving Austin is not an option right now. My fiancé is self-employed and makes about the same. The value of the home is around $450k, which is also borderline the most affordable home in Austin, and it keeps going up which is the reason for some urgency. My credit is excellent (802) but my student debt is $75k and my income-based repayments are $233/month (currently deferred until 10/21). On my income alone, the debt to income ratio is at almost exactly 50%, but of course that doesn’t include my fiancé splitting the mortgage with me. 

My fiancé’s credit is not great, he has a high debt to income ratio of his own (we met in a very expensive
grad program), I don’t know the exact number... but that’s why I wasn’t considering having him take out the loan with me - Because I don’t think (I’m not sure) it would help. Though he would split the mortgage/taxes/insurance with me 50/50, making my real life DTI ratio around a doable 25%. 

Basically I would need to qualify for a loan of around 225k when I use my mom’s 225k gift of equity as a down payment. I do have about 70k invested in my roth IRA, as well, but if I didn’t have to touch that, obviously that would be preferable. But if that’s my only option, I’m not opposed. 

I have already contacted a lender and he sent my numbers to Fannie Mae and was rejected. He didn’t seem particularly creative or optimistic, but I’m really hopeful we can make this work. Is there any way to move some money/numbers around to get to the passable 45% DTI ratio?

355,EE Bond Questions,"I have a variety of EE Bonds that were purchased between 1991-2006. I'm having trouble understanding some things.

They have a set interest rate, but are guaranteed to double after 20 years. After that, they will accrue interest at the set rate until 30 years, is that correct?

If that is correct, I don't understand how the Treasury Direct website is calculating the bond value. Can someone explain? See example below.

* $50 bond purchased 2002 at 0.28% interest rate now valued $102. It hasn't been 20 years, so the value hasn't doubled, and the interest rate is so low.
* Second example: $50 bond purchased on 2003 at 0.28% interest rate now valued at $72.84
* These bonds are only one year different, but one has more than doubled and the other isn't even close. It doesn't add up in my mind. These numbers were obtained from the Treasury Direct website/calculator.

Above questions were answered, still have questions below:

\-If the interest rate is only 0.28%, wouldn't it make sense to cash it after the 20 years and put it into a savings account or CD? Even though interest rates are low right now, I could get 0.5% in a savings account. (I plan to use the money for a large purchase in the near future, not for long term investment)

\-The remainder of bonds are 1.08-4.0% interest, so I should just keep those in the bond for better interest than what a savings account could offer currently?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6l0ea/ee_bond_questions/,1611799140.0,1,1,0
356,Employer not withholding federal income taxes - multiple jobs,"My wife and I both work full time and make over $150K/year combined.  She recently took a side job where she only works a couple of days per month.  She’s gotten a couple of checks so far and they have not withheld any federal income taxes.  I presume this is because, by their payroll company’s calculations (Paychex), she won’t make enough (at their office) to pay federal income taxes.  

Is there a way to get them to take out federal income taxes other than manually entering additional withholdings?

As a second question, we both claim 0 dependents/exemptions on our payroll taxes at our primary employers.  We do this to have the maximum taxes taken out so that we hopefully don’t owe anything to the IRS at the end of the year.  But for the 2nd (or maybe 3rd year) in a row now, we owe close to $3,000.  Why is this?  We didn’t use to have this problem.

Recently ex and I have started talking about including a buyout option also to keep the kids in current school....

she is considering buying me out @70k. This would be acceptable but what she she really wants to do is modify the settlement agreement and only take $20k of the 90k of my 401k that she was awarded....a difference of $70k and effectively leaving me with no equity from the house but less impact to my 401k and of course if I wanted to use that amount for a downpayment in the future it obviously includes penalties and taxes

What would be a smarter financial decision? Counter with a cash only buyout of 70k or counter that if she wants to forfeit getting my 401k money she needs forfeit all 90k......or simply sell the house. We are in dfw, tx and it’s a sellers market right now.

After lurking around for the past couple of months and doing some thinking, I decided to post here and ask for your opinions on my financial plan

I'll be starting work full-time at Amazon as an IT Engineer this upcoming Summer. I was fortunate enough to land an Amazon internship last Summer which led to a return offer and I feel like after 4 years of hard work and studying, (knock on wood) things are looking up

My salary will be 65k, with a 30k signing bonus, 7k cash (not taxed) for relocation, and 35k in stocks that are vested out within 4 years. The signing bonus is upfront and in one single installment

I have 30k in student loans that do not accrue interest until 2025.

I am realistically going to make around 90k with probably around 10-20k added in stocks by December 2023 due to Amazon's promotion system/process.

After thinking for a while, this is my current plan for the next 2 years:

1. Aim to save 20k/year, so have 40k saved up by the end of 2023.

2. Use the 7k for move-in expenses (apartment deposit, furniture)

3. Out of $4818/month (57,816K yearly after tax)

Rent: $1500/month

Car lease: $250/month

Food: $500/month

Entertainment: $500/month

Other Bills (Phone, Gas, etc): $200/month

Savings: $2000/month

4. I know I will get a lot of crap for this, but I am planning on using my stocks to pay off my student loans once it's fully vested. I am planning on using my savings to start investing after a year (maybe even buy a rental property). Is this a dumb idea?

Whenever I go to my “paycheck contributions” it says that I cannot make contribution rate changes at this time. I chose one of the “recommended” investment strategies but I am confused since I don’t know how much money will be taken out of my paycheck.

Would someone explain to me how can I know how much money will be taken out of my paycheck? I am a little worried because I get paid just above the minimum wage, making about $25K a year. Is there a way I can see how much money I will be putting in my retirement and adjust it? I don’t want to have a tight budget if a make a mistake setting up this.
I am new to this and I have never ever invested on anything. I have read multiple reddit posts and though I learned a few things, I am still confused.

Also, I believe I chose roth instead of traditional.

377,"Question - Should I raise my credit limit and buy a laptop on credit, or buy the laptop outright and raise my limit later?","I am doing my annual budget (quite late I know, thanks unemployment!) and I will need to purchase a laptop in September/October before I begin school in the fall. I am wondering if I should simply throw it on my credit card after I raise the limit, or if I should buy the laptop in full on a debit, wait for my savings to refill, then up my credit limit at a later date.

Some details:

* The card I would be raising the limit on is a *secured* credit card with a current limit of $800. I would be spending the $2200 to raise the limit to its max of $3000.
* The credit card company would indeed pull an inquiry on my credit to raise the limit, but it would be a *soft* inquiry, the company confirmed.
* The laptop I would like to purchase is $2650 (looking for no advice on this, thanks)
* I understand the newfound balance of $2650 after purchasing the laptop would affect my credit negatively for the time the balance is outstanding; but the laptop would be paid off well before I would need to use my credit score for *anything*.

I've been told time and time again to not purchase anything on a credit card that you can already afford with a debit card. It might be the fact that it's a secured credit card, but I feel like no matter which way I put down the money - either card, or debit - it just makes more sense  to me to raise my limit and purchase the laptop at the same time, rather than listening to that advice and buying the laptop on debit, since I can afford it, and raising the limit later.

The only down side I could see to this is *potentially* needing to use my credit score while I'm still showing a high open balance on the card. I'm truly not too worried about that, but I feel like that thinking is similar to the mindset that don't need health/life insurance *right now* just because you don't think you'll die *this year*. God forbid, someone totals my car and I need to apply for a new auto loan, or I become displaced from my apartment for whatever reason and need to apply with a new landlord, but those are two unlikely scenarios, and I'm not sure how much weight I should be putting on their potential to occur. (I do suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, so I frequently worry about things that will absolutely never happen... pretty sure these are logical things to consider?)

My other side of thinking is that I use the full $800 limit I currently have on the card towards the cost of the laptop, and pay the remaining $1850 out of my debit. This minimizes the amount coming out of my liquid, and eases the amount needed to pay off my credit card and maintain my credit score. I feel like this is ultimately the smarter choice, but I'd like some confirmation to my thinking.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6k1gi/question_should_i_raise_my_credit_limit_and_buy_a/,1611796406.0,0,0,0
378,Roth IRA over contribution back in 2018,"Hi all, I was going over my previous years tax returns and found out I may have over contributed to my  Roth IRAs because of MAGI.

MAGI = $125163

2018 Vanguard Roth IRA Contribution: $5500

2019/2020/2021 Roth IRAs are also maxed out but MAGI is much lower so no overcontribution issues in these years.

Based on this [p590a--**2018**.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p590a--2018.pdf) Worksheet 2-2, I figured my reduced contribution limit is $3607, so my excess is $**1893**. Is this the correct worksheet or should I use [p590a--**2019**.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p590a--2019.pdf)?

I would like to know how to fix it (e.g. what forms I need to file this year, whether I have to withdraw contributions/earnings). Should I also withdraw some contribution from 2020/2021 to avoid some penalties?

•have a diverse portfolio to minimize risk/loss

Story time. Ok so sometime ago my mom asked me to make a new account with Sprint because she wasn’t doing too well financially and with her credit. So I made the account and added her and my younger brother on there, so we had three lines in total. Time goes on and we decide to close the account for whatever reason. The close out amount was $7xx and it would be knocked down to $3xx after we sent back in our phones. My mom said she would send the phones back for us and then also call and pay the remaining balance to get that taken care of. This was a year ago. Fast forward to now and last month I took a huge hit on my credit card and saw it was from collections and it was the full amount of that Sprint bill. I freaked because my credit score was 760+ and this brought it down 80 points or so. Come to find out, my mom never sent the phones or made the payment. So I immediately called Sprint, we got the bill paid for the closed account, and then I called the debt collections office, where they said it would be removed from my credit reports in 30-45 days.

401,"""Windfall"" and IRA contributions","Long story short, my dad (57) bought two annuities at $50k each 4 years ago. After recently getting more involved with his finances, we were getting worried that he didn't have enough retirement savings for him and my mom to retire comfortable (the end goal). We decided that since he's still working and able to work for more years (he works an office job), that it would be best to put the annuity money to better use than sitting in an annuity with very little gains. So now, we have this ""windfall"" and I wanted to make sure we were going about this the right way. Below is the plan and a few questions that we had:

* The $100k for the annuities came from a cash-out refinance. From my understanding, this doesn't trigger any extra taxes owed since this value is a loan added on top of the original mortgage, correct?
* The interest income from the annuities is taxable, but since we're withdrawing in the surrender period, taxes and surrender charge eat up into the principal and he's actually getting only $49,500 on one of them. This also doesn't trigger any tax implications correct?
* For the $49,500 sudden ""windfall,"" our plan was to contribute the $14000 maximum for 2020 & 2021 for him and another $14000 maximum for 2020 & 2021 as a spousal IRA for my mom (my dad's annual salary is around $95k). Since we don't expect any major salary increases and he's much closer to retirement, would a Traditional IRA (rather than Roth) make more sense for him and my mom? I've read through the wiki and this seems to be the way to go, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything.
* Since it's already past January, if he makes a 2020 Traditional IRA contribution now, is it too late to deduct the $14000 amount from his 2020 taxes? Will he have to deduct $28000 from the 2021 taxes? This seems like a huge deduction and I'm worried it might trigger some flags, though I don't know what since this is all legitimate.
* The other thing we wanted to do with the money was to refinance and potentially pay some points to minimize the interest rate. Te closing costs would be around $11,000 at the maximum. We don't really expect to be moving out of the house any time soon, so it seems like we'll at least break even. The lowest interest rate we've seen is around 2.375% 30yr compared to his 4.75% 30 yr (currently 26yr since he refinanced recently).
* The remaining amount would be to pay off credit card debt (which he luckily doesnt have too much of) and beef up the emergency fund.
* We're waiting til April to surrender the other $50k since the surrender period for that one ends at that time. We're not really sure what to do with this extra $50k, but likely it will go to the emergency fund again and slowly slip it into his 401k (by maximizing his contributions via payroll and using the $50k to replace the monthly income).

410,I am 27 and just started my first 'real job.' I have access to exclusive investment research and a 401k. How do I maximize my financial success with literally no prior financial wisdom?,"**INFO:** 

  
\- New job's starting salary: $75k (More like $52k after taxes), annual bonus & potential for increase

\- Additional Income: \~$5,000 / year

\- Location: Maryland, USA

\- Current monthly rent: $550/month

\- Utilities: \~$130/month

\- Food/Dining: \~$250/month

\- Insurances: $190/month

\- Debt: $35,000 student loans, 6k other debt

&#x200B;

I'm a little late to the game as far as getting a hang of finances. Up until now, I've lived off of waitressing tips and video gigs. It worked but it was basically treading water while larger debts grew under the surface. I deduct part of my rent for my home office and all business expenses.

&#x200B;

**GOALS:**

\- Invest as much as I can to earn passive income

\- Pay off immediate debt

\- Begin saving/earning for retirement/house/etc

\- Afford a bigger place

\- Network with the many successful people this job puts me in contact with

\- Grow my wealth

\- Retire at reasonable (if not early) age and focus on my personal passions/business ventures

\- 10-15 years down the line: no more college debt? (Not my top priority)

\- 20 years: help my parents out

&#x200B;

**QUESTIONS** (Explain like I'm 5, my brain has a hard time absorbing this kind of information which is why I'm here after many a googling):

\- How realistic are my goals?

\- What should I be working towards (career-wise, budgeting-wise) to achieve my goals?

\- Even though I work for an investment research company, I really don't know much about investing (I do media content). Should I bother with ETF's because they're hands-off? Or skip this step because of my access to awesome research and invest in individual stocks? Or are ETF's still the more safe, cost effective way to move forward?

\- On what platform should I be investing? I have a Robinhood account, but the interest rate is low. What earns the highest annual interest? What's the difference between a high interest rate or an account that pays dividends and is one better?

\- What percent of my income should I pay into my 401k and should I bother with a Roth IRA if I already have a 401k?

I don't want to squander this opportunity to struggle less than I was before. In fact, I'd love to get comfortable or even wealthy if I can. I know this job could be a long term thing but life is always uncertain. I know I'm a bit naive about this whole process, and learning about it makes my brain melt, but I really want to try and get smart with my money.

411,401(k) + Roth IRA vs. Roth401(k),"Hey everyone, 

I (21/m) just started my first full-time job. I am deciding which path to choose, having either: 401(k) + RothIRA vs. solely a Roth401(k). I finished ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich"" by Ramit Sethi and just came across some information in ""Money Master the Game"" by Tony Robbins. 

My initial thought was to contribute to my 401(k) to the point that my employer would match the contribution + x% (free money). I also planned on maxing out my RothIRA annually ($6,000 annual contribution limit). I prefer a Roth because I fully expect my taxes to increase as I progress in my professional career. 

I just came across the information that within a Roth401(k) the annual contribution limit is $19,500 --> I assumed it would be the same limit as a RothIRA but I stand corrected. I am aware that the employer match would be added tax free and that I would have to pay taxes on the employer match at withdrawal, but the significantly increased annual contribution has me leaning towards solely investing into a Roth401(k) despite the lack of funds I would have at my availability to invest in. As I previously stated, I prefer the Roth due to the tax-free withdrawal even though I am sacrificing potential gains that are sacrificed by investing tax-free money in a typical 401(k). I feel like contributing in solely a Roth401(k) would simplify my retirement accounts and make the process more seamless and simplified. Am I missing something here? 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Found out Roth401(k) has an annual contribution limit of $19,500 vs. Roth IRA is $6,000 --> So now am determining if I should invest solely into a Roth401(k) to simplify stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6cxi2/401k_roth_ira_vs_roth401k/,1611777544.0,3,3,0

From what I have read, it would cost an arm and a leg to open up an account with an Israeli brokerage.

For starters, just open an EU brokerage account now + keep my German savings account as a reference account + just keep investing from that account till it's all gone (emergency fund is separate of this)? Once I start a job in Israel how should I keep buying?

I (age 31) have been in the intelligence community since 2013 and I intend on staying in it until retirement.

I conservatively estimate that my gross pension when I retire at age 62 will be around $3,326 per month for life ($864 per month if I were to retire now).  I know I shouldn't rely on social security since that is no guarantee, but I feel like I can count on my pension (could be wrong).

1. My Thrift Savings Plan allocation is currently 50% C, 15% S and 35% I.  Would keeping it at 100% stocks even while in retirement make sense since my pension will fulfill the purpose of bonds anyway?
2. I know the /r/personalfinance flowchart recommends that at least 15% of my gross income should go toward retirement, but I'm currently doing 10% and it appears to be plenty.  At age 62 assuming an average 7% rate of return I should have around $2.5 million plus my pension.  I know more can't hurt, but unless I'm missing something it seems like I can just consider another 5% optional.

435,How to approach paying for medical school,"I'm very fortunate to have earned a significant amount of money in the past two days from trading stocks which should allow me to pay off the entire four years of medical school on my own. Would it be better to use the cash I currently have on hand (\~350k USD) towards paying for medical school by the year, or would it be better to take out loans and keep all of the money invested in an index fund?

From what I understand, loans for medical school in the US accrue 6-7% interest every year which I believe would be more than offset by the yearly gains from letting my money sit in an index fund. I also haven't been able to find much information on the likelihood of having my loans frozen during residency, subsidized by my future employer, or forgiven entirely.

440,My landlord is making it really hard to pay him (aka how can I send money to an LLC?),"I hope this is an appropriate sub to ask this question, and I also apologize if this is a dumb question. I think it'll become pretty clear that I'm not super savvy in various ways of transferring money electronically.

The man who owns the home I'm renting wants to be paid through an LLC he owns. He prefers electronic payment.

From that point... he gave me the routing and account number of his LLC's bank account and basically told me to figure it out.

My bank has a P2P money transferring system (Zelle), but that's only for personal transactions, not for sending money to a business. I looked into PayPal's Xoom service, but that also appears to be only for personal transactions.

I guess I could send him a wire transfer using the account number he gave me, but I pretty much refuse to add $30 in fees onto my rent every month.

As I see it, I my options are to mail him a check or have my bank's ""Bill Pay"" service send him a check. They have electronic bill pay for big companies that they recognize, but this is a one-man LLC, so all I can do is have them mail a check.

Is there something glaring I'm missing here? (I fully accept that I could be, since I've never dealt with this kind of landlord situation before.) Is there something electronic I can do with the routing and account number of a business account that won't cost me a ton in fees every month?

441,JP Morgan Chase fee dispute - HELP,"Greetings, three years ago I went into a Chase branch bank in Chicago to ensure that I was not enrolled in any accounts that would accrue fees. I did this because I was going into an anesthesia residency and didnt want to think about my accounts. With the help of an agent I was enrolled in accounts, signed on the dotted line, and was assured I would not have any fees while my focus was elsewhere for three years. Well, I finished my residency in August, began to address my financial situation and quickly realized I had been assessed a $20 fee every month for the last three years. So roughly $720. 

I understand that the onus is on me for not checking my bank statements for so long, but it was a savings account that I did not believe need to be monitored. After all, I was assured by the branch banker that I would not have to worry about fees for the duration of my three year residency. Something I proactively tried to avoid in good faith. Turns out, I was enrolled in a savings account with a $15,000 minimum balance, a number I was nowhere close to ever having. The account had roughly $2500 in it. 

I have escalated this complaint as high as I can over the phone and email, but Chase remains steadfast in their opinion that I should have been checking my billing statements, that I am responsible for the fees, and that they could only reimburse me for the last six months of fees. I dont know about you, but I think $120 of the original $720 they took from me is a bit insulting, and what they did seems rather predatory in nature. I understand that I made a mistake, but what would have happened if I didnt notice? Roughly 30% of my money was essentially stolen as I was not awarded any benefit for being enrolled in this particular savings account. Do you think there is any way to get this money back?

Background: 
- moving from Chicago to possibly Seattle
- living in River North / Gold Coast
- Rent has been between $1900-2400 but split cost between myself and mans 
- moved to Texas before covid and moved back to Chicago in April due to working remote...
- didn’t know if I would have to go back or not, so I moved my items into storage unit. The items are about 5k worth of value and I bought them with my moving package
- I have 13k in personal savings, always around 8k in checking. And I would like to spend under 4K moving.

Jobs:
Chicago: 
- used to make 72k and 10% bonus, 4K sign on 
Texas: 
- current job, make 95k, 20% bonus (paid quarterly), 15k moving bonus, 4K sign on and pretty miserable and boring 
Opportunity: 
- not sure...definitely won’t have a bonus and salary will be less but I am saving so much at my current job that my take home is same as my previous salary🤷‍♀️ 


Questions:
- is it worth flying down to Texas and hiring two people for labor and using a shipping pod to move those belongings? I’ve estimated cost at $3000 for this 
- or do I fly down... pay to stay somewhere for a few days... deal with selling everything... ship 6+ boxes across the country of things I’m not selling...and re buy everything
- do I drive my car from Chicago to Seattle and fill that with my belongings that are in Chicago (3 suitcases and a box or 3)
- or pay to have my car shipped as well....
- I know this new roles average pay is 80k. I think I would be comfortable with that but is it worth negotiating because my previous pay was so high? Note: roles are different and one is a corporation.

I have been trying to get an account with Sallie Mae over their website to start paying off my loans or at least see what the situation was with them, I'm not able to make an account.

Although I've been advised against this, I ended up calling them to talk with a representative, she took down my information and still couldn't find anything on me, and also , she said I didn't have an account with them and she was unable to make me one.

She suggested I call National Student Loan Data System. I  did, couldn't talk to a representative, all I'm trying to do is find where my loan is with Sallie Mae, how much I owe or if I even have any at this point. 

I checked my credit through Credit Karma and Loans through Sallie Mae do not appear on either of the credit reports that appear on Credit Karma.

448,Help me sort my situation out / focus on saving (UK),"Hi all

I've been struggling with a gambling addiction for a long time and have recently lost around £60,000 which included all of my savings plus around £10k in debt.  I need to refocus to get past this and I think having a solid financial plan would really help with that.

**My circumstances**:

30s male, living with partner who owns her apartment.  Good job with lots of potential.  Mediocre credit rating.  Got rid of all my high limit credit cards (AMEX, MBNA, Barclaycard & an old Marbles card) around a year ago after gambling issues caused me to rack up a lot of debt on them.  2 missed payments around 9 months ago on ccs and higher than average number of credit (mainly high interest loans) taken out / repaid over the past few years but other than that everything else is ok.  High risk tolerance.

**Income**

£43250 pre tax per year (£2650 per month after tax) + a chunky bonus received at the end of March.  Amount TBC for this year but expecting around 35% (\~£15k) of annual salary.  Pension is company 15% me 4%, invested in high risk plan.

Also do freelance work for £50 per hour.  I'm aiming for 80 - 100 hours freelance a month at the moment given there is nothing else to do and I need to get myself back on track.  Assume the lower end of this, so £4000 / month.

2650 + \~4000

= \~£6500 per month  + the bonus coming at the end of March.

**Outgoings**

My core outgoings are relatively low:

\- £600/month rent + bills

\- £300 therapy (hopefully this will reduce soon but I need it for now)

\- £200 food

\- £100 misc (travel, subscriptions etc).

**Debt**

High interest loan with £6290 remaining balance, at £262 / month.  Only 1 month in of 2 years.  Amount to settle today would be £4404 so decent amount of money to be saved paying off early.

Short term loan with £2512 left to pay over 11 months at £228/month.  This one is even higher interest.

Capital one ccs x2 with £200 balance each

Zopa cc with £300 balance

Vanquis cc with £150 balance

I have been clearing all of these each month but intend to get rid of the Vanquis and one capital one, and keep zopa plus the other for shopping etc. to build my credit back up.

I also pay a family member £1k / month (no interest) to repay debt.

**Total Outgoings**

Core - £1200

Debt (not including ccs) -   £1490

= £2690

Can anyone help advise me what my plan should be going forward?

Including

\- what best to do with my bonus (I assume clear my debt)

\- how much I should aim to have in my bank account

\- what I should be investing in (previously tracker fund in stocks and shares isa)?

We have good health insurance through my employer so no HSA

Sort of looking for just an order of operations with this stuff to best reach our goals.

453,Cost of Living Calculators,"I am trying to make sense of comparing salaries between a very low cost of living city and a much higher cost of living city. I’m hoping that someone has advice since the numbers seem odd. It seems that the calculators available vary quite a bit, but most give an equivalency for about $70,000 in salary in the cheap city to be about $120,000 in the new city. 

What confuses me about this is that I’m single, with no kids, and pretty frugal so I can live comfortably in the cheaper city on something like $25,000 per year. Multiplying that $25,000 by the 1.7 multiple gives a new (actually spent) cost of living of $42,500. So what’s interesting here is that looking at it this way would mean that in the cheaper city my savings (after paying for living) would be $70,000-$25,000 = $45,000 per year while the more expensive city would give a savings of $77,500.

That seems to show that the more expensive city is actually much better for someone who doesn’t have an expensive lifestyle since the savings rate is so much higher.

20% down we get 2.8% (rough numbers)

3% we get charged PMI... but what if we put 3% down then lump sum on first payment to reach the ""78% of loan left"" threshold to have PMI removed.

Is this essentially locking a lower rate and elimating PMI at the same time? let me know if I am missing something would love to discuss this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l6fb0k/pmi_payoff_after_20_equity_but/,1611784154.0,2,2,0
460,"Parent gifting $15K a year, unsure about tax implications and how to best use it","My father is going to start giving me $15,000 a year as a annual gift. He said he's getting old, has a substantive estate, he'd like to share while he's still alive to see me enjoy it. Yes, I have an awesome father.

He says it's basically tax free, I've been trying to read up online about gift taxes, and it appears my state (NC) doesn't have an estate or a gift tax. Still I honestly can't believe the IRS doesn't want a cut of this money.

Either way I'm trying to figure out what to do with this gift, as I've never had that much on hand in my life, all my money is tied up in my retirement fund and my house. I had planned to replace my ancient car with a new SUV this year, financing about $35K. But now with this $15K gift I'm divided if I should use this money to reduce how much I finance on the new car or put the money into a bathroom renovation in my house. The bathroom works but it's dated and needs an overhaul, as I plan to start renting out that part of the house on AirBnB.

470,"Wife and I made some mistakes last year and ended up owing just shy of $5000 in taxes for 2020, did we cover our bases for next year?","Hi personalfinance, I'm a long-time follower of the subreddit and tonight I've found myself in a spot to finally ask for some advice. I apologize for the length of this post in advance, but if you manage to bear with me and have any advice or commentary, I am very thankful.

My spouse and I filed our taxes tonight and discovered that we owed a lot more than we expected, about $5000. Yes, we filed very early, but we have all of our documents and do not have a complicated tax situation so we just got it done.

* We live in California
* We do not have kids
* We do not own a home
* We do not have any investments beyond each employer-provided 401k and a Roth IRA that we did not contribute to last year
* We have a higher-yield savings account that generated about $300 in interest
* We paid a few hundred dollars of interest in student loans due to the COVID-19 deferment
* We are shooting for $0 owed and a $0 return

The reason I say ""expected"" is because we did discover that we were in a pickle a bit past halfway through 2020.

## Federal Taxes

For most of last year I was making about $75k as an hourly employee working 4 days a week at 10 hours per day. I started working in that role in November 2019. Not long after starting I noticed that I was receiving 8 hours of regular pay and 2 hours of overtime (1.5x) each day, in addition to full days of holiday pay that fell on days I was not scheduled to work otherwise. Instead of thinking harder about this, I thought that was cool and enjoyed it; my spouse expressed that they didn't think that was normal but took my word for it to not worry (I know). Later on in the year I was called into a meeting with about 4 other coworkers in the same situation and my manager told us that this was not intended, but the company would not be asking for any repayment and that we should expect future paychecks to be decreased to their intended amounts. I was grateful that they didn't ask me to write them a check but naturally was concerned about my tax situation; I used the IRS withholding calculator for 2020 and it determined that to shoot for $0 owed, I should withhold an additional ~$230 per paycheck and my spouse should withhold an additional ~$100 per paycheck in federal taxes (amounts estimated based on my memory). Great, I modified our W4s and added that in. I do not recall what we were additionally withholding prior to this correction but I do know that we were shooting for $0 owed/returned. (EDIT: I'm realizing that we probably were not withholding anything additional prior to this, because I wouldn't have the same question that I detailed at the end of the post. We were probably just withholding whatever is automatically withheld by our employers.)

Then, in December 2020, I started a new job making $110k, plus a yearly 10% bonus, with a $10k signing bonus that was supposed to be paid out 90 days after starting. I figured that since I started in December and would receive 1.5 paychecks before the end of the year, I wouldn't bother using the calculator to create an accurate W4 and just submitted an unchanged W4 with no additional withholding. In my mind, whatever I owed would be minor given that I *should* have fixed most of my unpaid tax burden by increasing withholding at my former employer. My spouse did not change their withholding and continued to withhold ~$100 for the last month of 2020.

My signing bonus was unexpectedly paid out a few weeks into the new job and naturally fell into my 2020 income. Taxes were withheld from this (22% for federal, which agrees with what I read elsewhere online about how much bonuses are taxed, as well as other applicable taxes). I am unsure if this had an effect on how much we ended up owing in federal taxes, but my hunch is that it did.

Our federal taxes owed has come out to **$2235**, much higher than I expected given the adjustments that we made to our W4s to compensate for my stupidity.

## State Taxes

After the shock that we were in because of our federal tax situation, we were dismayed to discover that we owe **$2628** to the state of California in unpaid taxes. I had no idea where this came from as we followed California's DE-4 instructions very closely:

* I took 2 standard allowances for the both of us with no additional withholding
* My spouse took 0 allowances with no additional withholding

We discovered that my spouse paid $5 in California income tax for the entirety of 2020. Unbeknownst to both of us, the checkbox on their DE-4 stating that they are exempt from state income tax was checked since January of 2020. We can only conclude that while we were filling out the W4 when their company switched payroll systems that month, we weren't paying attention and checked that box. My spouse made $26.55 hourly for most of 2020 and then began making $65k salary in October 2020. No federal or state withholding adjustments were made with the new pay rate so they were still withholding the additional ~$100 federal per paycheck that was calculated to fix my own mistake described previously.

This was a mistake on both of our parts, a big one at that. We should have noticed this much sooner. We have corrected the problem now and they have only received 2 paychecks this month that have no state income tax withheld.

## Where We Are Now

* We filed our taxes and are set to pay back what we owe. Based on the issues mentioned above, I have no reason to believe that the numbers are incorrect. We have a substantial emergency fund and will be fine shouldering this burden, though it may take a bit for the embarrassment to wear off. Payments have been scheduled for the new tax season start date of February 12 2021.
* We fixed the California DE-4 exemption checkbox, as mentioned.

Earlier this month I used the IRS withholding calculator with the first paycheck that we each received for 2021 to determine what our federal withholding should be to achieve $0 owed/returned. It determined that I should be withholding $208 additional per paycheck (up from the $0 that I withheld after transitioning to my new job but down from the ~$230 I was withholding at my old job), and that my spouse should withhold $73 additional per paycheck (down from the ~$100 that they were withholding). We both adjusted our W4s as such.

Tonight, after panicking at the unexpected owed taxes, I decided to go through the IRS withholding calculator again. Despite our increased withholding that we set based on the calculation from earlier this month, it estimates that we will **owe $2040** in federal taxes at the end of the year. To owe $0, it says to:

1. Set my additional withholding to $210
2. Set my spouse' additional withholding to $74

Next to both of these numbers, it says ""this is an amount of withholding over and above the standard withholding from each paycheck for this job if lines 3 through 4(c) of the Form W-4 were blank or zero."" At the moment, line 4(c) is not blank or zero since we are withholding the additional $208 and $73 respectively. Those numbers are suspiciously close to the earlier numbers that were returned.

So my questions are:

1. How much did the early bonus affect our tax burden?
2. When considering my expected yearly 10% bonus, on the IRS withholding calculator, am I correct to check the box that says ""My employer will withhold the appropriate taxes from this future bonus"" since I do see that taxes are being withheld from my bonuses?
3. Do we add the $210 and $74 returned by the calculator onto the additional withholding that we are already doing since the beginning of the month, effectively doubling our additional withholding? Am I interpreting and using this calculator correctly?
4. How do we correct our state withholding for the two paychecks that my spouse has received this year with $0 state income tax withheld? Just take a guess at an additional amount of state withholding on a new DE-4?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5ymtv/wife_and_i_made_some_mistakes_last_year_and_ended/,1611730623.0,14,14,0

487,Any former Wells Fargo advisors?,"I am helping an elderly acquaintance who wants to keep their investments at Wells Fargo Advisors. From past experience, I know WF advisors like to push Franklin and American funds. They balk at low cost funds like Vanguard because they won't get as big of a cut.

How can I get the advisor to look beyond Franklin and American funds? What else should I look out for when dealing with a Wells Fargo advisor? Did WF push you to tell clients to make questionable decisions? I really just want to know more about how the company advises its employees to work with clients so I know what to look for.

492,"How can I make use of my investments and withdraw/borrow, in case of emergency.","I am expected to close on a home purchase next month, using virtually all of my savings and a small 401k loan to cover down + closing costs.

For my next few paychecks prior to closing, I plan to significantly decrease my ESPP to bare minimum so its still actively enrolled and decrease my 401k contributions to the pre-tax minimum that takes advantage of the company match. This is so I can rebuild my savings as well as have some money to quickly payoff the 401k loan, which should give me about a $5k safety net by close of escrow.

**If I encounter a situation where I need money for any scenario (repairs, emergency, debt payments). I'd like to what I can do with these investments:**

* Former employer 401ks - $170k (75% in pre-tax / 25% in roth)
* Current employer 401k - $35k (but 15k loaned out per above)
* Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) - $30k 

Some options that I understood in this subreddit or from various friends:

1. Rollover those former 401ks to a Trad IRA and a ROTH IRA, then withdraw from ROTH IRA if I have to since I already paid tax.
2. Do same as 1, but also rollover some amount to the current 401k in case a 2nd loan is needed (our policy allows two active loans, from funds that are 50% vested). Since I'm at 50% now with the first loan, rolling over more into the current 401k will give me some buffer.
3. Sell the stocks from the ESPP ($30k non-tradeable). I have $20k that meets the holding period by June this year, and $10k June next year.

Another thing is that my parents have offered me about $20k as a gift for down + closing, but they are just barely a year into retirement and I said to hold on to their money until end of year so they can see how their situation plays out. If they are fine, gift me by 2022 which I'll use to pay off the 401k loan and keep the rest in safety net.

**Income: $110k** ($5,200 monthly take home after all deductions/taxes). 

**Current Expenses:**

$20 streaming services 

$70 electric

$60 Internet

$70 phone bill
$400 groceries/restaurants (I know, we eat out a lot) 

$20 vehicle gas 

$10 renter’s insurance 

$75 car insurance 

$1450 rent

I have about $60K in a traditional IRA that I rolled over from a former employer's 401k a few years ago. It was being managed for a 1.3% fee because I didn't feel confident in my investing knowledge, but now (after researching more and reading this sub) I feel about ready to take it on. (Current positions listed below)

I did an in-kind transfer to Vanguard, and I think I'd like to do one of these options:

* sell everything and put it into a target fund (my current 401k is in Vanguard's for 2055);
* sell everything except the VFIAX and create something like the three-fund portfolio, counting the VFIAX as part of the portion that would be allocated to VTSAX;
* something else that you recommend?

I'm considering selling everything other than VFIAX because the expense ratios seem high and I just want to keep things very simple. Here's where things are now (expense ratio), with about $16k in VFIAX and the rest spread out among the others:

* VFIAX (.04)
* BAGIX (.30)
* BEXIX (1.09)
* CRSOX (.78)

I have about 25k in debt through the program and my credit is already shot. FDR says they can settle it for about 15k but there is about 4K in fees tied to this. 

Is it wise to call collectors and try to settle this on my own? How can I learn how to negotiate / settle this debt? 

I have 15k I can pay to FDR and be done but I would essentially be paying 4K in fees. Could I settle or negotiate as well as they can?

519,Use stocks to pay off student loans?,"Hi All,

Background info: 28, have $22k/3.9%  in student loan debt after refinancing last year with Sofi. Original loan was Fed $27k/5.5% (pre-COVID and pre any interest holds). Terms are pay off in 60 months - payments are about $500 a month 

Income: Wife and I combined are making $145k - Both of us are in stable jobs 

Retirement: I have $20k in work 401K, she has $27k in her work one and $10k in a Roth

Investments: Started a Vanguard account in October, so far we have invested about $24k and our account stands at $34k. About half is invested in VFIAX and the rest in individual stocks

Bank Account: We have $20k in the bank

Other Info: She owns the condo we live in, bought for $225k, put down $50k, $160k is left on the loan. We bought a car in November - $36k loan @ 1.9% 60 months. Other than this no other debt.

  
Would it be smart to sell some shares in order to pay off my student loans? We are saving up to buy a new house in the next 2-5 years and an extra $500 a month would be nice to have. Is this idea smart? I know that we'd be on the hook for STCG. Our investment account has grown quite a bit since inception, but I know that average ROI is about 7%. The rate at which our account is growing is outpacing the interest owed on my loan greatly, so that's why I'm iffy on selling and paying down my debt.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l69er1/use_stocks_to_pay_off_student_loans/,1611767842.0,1,1,0

527,The case for paying medical expenses out of pocket (instead of HSA),"I've seen this conversation come up from time to time - is it better to pay medical expenses using funds in your HSA or to pay out of pocket, assuming you have the cash reserves to pay out of pocket if you so choose? 

My answer is *yes*, it is advisable to pay out of pocket. Here's my personal example as to why this is the case.

My wife and I got to the point of having cash on hand available to pay for medical expenses in 2018, so we started to do so. We keep track of how much we have spent (thus how much we have available for reimbursement). In the HSA, we keep $5k (out of a family deductible of $7k), just in case we are in a pinch and need to reimburse ourselves.

Since we started doing this, we have withdrawn from the HSA for big ticket items (e.g. having our first child), but many our expenses have been paid out of pocket. When we had our second, we just set up a payment plan (why not, right? no discount for paying early and no penalty for paying over time). As of this moment, we are able to reimburse ourselves for up to $7,644.36 in out-of-pocket medical expenses. 

If we had reimbursed ourselves in the moment, then we would still have money in the HSA, but we would not have had enough to invest. 

Last year, our investment account returned dividends and market gains of $595; since 2018, the investment account has returned $1,111. 

Considering we've maxed out our HSA each of the past three years, this means that we have gotten $1,111 on top of the $21,000 that has already been invested (combination of employer and employee contributions), or 5.3% in free money (subject to market fluctuations, of course). On top, the $5k that we keep in the cash account is essentially additional emergency fund since it's all available for immediate, penalty-free withdrawal.

I think the case to pay out of pocket - if you are able and if you can invest some portion of your HSA - is pretty compelling. Thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l68m1k/the_case_for_paying_medical_expenses_out_of/,1611765913.0,1,1,0

I want to understand the tax implications as I know there are phase-outs for various deductions and credits

2020 AGI was $127,000 so we're into the 22% marginal tax bracket MFJ.  I expect a small mid-year cost-of-living raise in 2021.  No state income tax here.

I got approved for an auto loan and wanted to use my emergency fund to reduce the amount I have to take out on the loan. Doing so would save me over 100$ in monthly payments.

545,Contributions for my 401k deducted but not deposited into account for 2 years.,"I have been working for this small business for going on 11 years. In 2018, I was offered another job and was about to leave but then my employer offered me    

1. 9% salary increase  
2. 401K retirement plan with up to 5% matching contribution
3. Stock option (10 shares of the company ) – profit sharing 

Now all of that sounded way better than what I was getting, plus I did not want to commute into the city everyday. I reviewed my first quarterly statement and my contributions were going in just fine and after that I didn't really check on it again. Until my husband lost his job in Sept. and we were making ends meat but unemployment has run out and extensions are delayed. I decided to check my 401k thinking that I can probably take out a loan for hardship. I have 3 kids and 1 income and no medical insurance, etc.. That is when I checked my annual statement for 2020 I noticed a huge discrepancy. The money was not there, my contributions are not listed and neither is the employers contributions. I mentioned it to my employer and she stated that she didn't know and that I should contact Merrill Edge who handles my 401k account. I dont really understand the 401k plan either but I know that the money has been deducted from my check 2 times a month and should be growing . There is a little over $1600 in that account and now I am wondering where my  money is. I want to see the money trail on paper. What are my employer's penalties and how much did I loose in her not managing my contributions correctly and will I be compensated for what was lost. Close to $8000 of my contributions and who knows what her contributions were suppose to be.

548,What to do with husband’s income that’s not needed for living expenses? Can we put it all into tax advantaged accounts?,"Would appreciate some insight into our plans for my husband’s income. We’re not sure if a financial advisor is needed at this point. If it changes anything, we are a married couple, late 20s, in a MCoL area in the US.

My husband has been self-employed for as long as we’ve been married, doing consulting work. It was more like a hobby and the net income varied between $30-50k/yr. I am a W-2 employee and make $230k plus bonuses, commissions, and stock options which in some years amounted to a total comp of $400k. For the sake of our budget, we only use my base salary since all the others are a “maybe”. I work from home and always have been (since before covid). 

He had decided he wanted to pursue his dream career and recently got hired for it. It’s a government position that pays $90k/yr, more with OT but he has no plans for that. It offers great benefits, pension, yadda yadda. 

Issue: we don’t need that $90k for our daily life, so we’re looking for ways to get that paycheck into some investment/retirement accounts for the future. We file taxes MFJ, no kids or dependents. 

Questions: 

1. How much can he contribute to IRAs, 401(k), 457(b) per year, given our combined income? 
2. Is it necessary to take out a life insurance policy if I don’t depend on his income? This new job is dangerous and there is a high risk of injury or even death. 
3. What to do with the surplus that can’t be dumped into tax advantaged accounts? Just put it in a normal brokerage account?

I plan on moving from SF -> NY this Fall and this would be my first long distance move! I'm trying to understand how much rent I can afford and wanted to run my thinking by you guys:

Monthly gross pay: $6100k, I'm on a commission based job which shares bonuses quarterly and the $6100k doesn't include commission but let's just use that number to be conservative.

Based on the 30% rule of thumb, I should be looking at apartments around $1800 but the ones that really excite me are in the $2500 range

Also, I have quite a large sum of cash(haven't really learned how to invest yet but working on it).

So, my question is would it be okay to go for the apartments I really like in the $2500 one and make up the difference using my commission and cash reserves? Or am I getting in over my head and should stick to the $1800 mark.

554,"Schwab brokerage account locked for 29 days, banned from TD Ameritrade","Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub

I'll start with Charles Schwab.

I had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account. I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity.

When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money?

Does it usually take this long?

If I do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years?

Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long?

I’m getting my finances in order, and as most of you know, job security is a very important part of personal finance. I’ve been an intern at a commercial real estate company for about 2 and a half months. I’ve proven myself in many ways, and was even asked to get my real estate license so that I can begin handling finances. My boss is showing me the ropes and has even taken me with him on several property showings.

I’m currently considered an office manager/intern in a company of 3 people (manager, broker and me). Don’t get me wrong, this is a very elite company. I was simply lucky enough to come through at the perfect time when two brokers left, and I had ties with the owner who I convinced to give me a stab at intern. Like I said, I’ve proven myself and have yet to mess up with anything, but I’m also inexperienced with real estate and I understand why it might be more feasible for my boss to get a more experienced person on the team. 

The reason my boss let me come on in the first place was not only to give me a stab at the position, but to fill a crucial role. Without me right now, the company would be seriously struggling. And I don’t think my boss would be able to find an adequate replacement, nor would he even try within the next couple months. At that point, would it really be worth him hiring a new manager and having me train them?

Hi, I'm a relatively new grad and very naive about finances and was looking for help. My current income is \~100k a year. I'm a bit older (late 20s, early 30s).

Anywho, I'm incredibly naive about finances. Let me list out my financial ""profile"" so you understand me a bit better:

1. I have \~70k in student loans.
2. I have a checking account (no saving account) with \~40k saved up.
3. I don't have any investments.
4. I have a car and paid it off this month, so no car payments for me.
5. My credit score is around 720 last time I checked.
6. I only really have 2 monthly payments at the moment, one being my car insurance and the other student loans, which are in forbearance (don't have to pay) until September this year, 2021.

I was getting ready to move out in early 2020, but because ya-know-what-virus, I stayed at home with my parents... My bills are:

1. Car insurance (\~70.00 a month via Progressive - anyone know any cheaper places?)
2. Student loans, which are about \~300.00/month once this Student loan forbearance ends, which I believe is this year September 2021...

I am looking for advice - do I need to get a financial advisor? I keep getting spammed by them on LinkedIn. Should I have a savings account right now? Should I pay the minimum on my student loans or pay it all of now? Isn't Joe Biden going to possibly cut the student loan debt for many students? Should I even think about moving right now and if so, should I be looking to rent or buy?

I guess if I want to pay the loans off asap, the \~40k will have to be used for that, so I probably won't be able to get a %20 down payment fast enough for a place.... unless I choose to rent. But if I pay the student loan min. payment a month, I could potentially have a down payment by the middle/end of this year for a place (unless I choose to rent).

Now I work at a job that pays $15 an hour.  This is almost twice as much as I was making, so I have a lot more cash left over, and all of that goes directly into a savings account.

Sure, I might withdraw from my savings here and there if something comes up, but it's really just sitting there, stagnate.  I get interest on it, but it's not a whole lot.  I feel like I could invest it in something, or put it in another type of account that might 'mature'.  Basically, I think I have cash ""that can work for me"", but I don't know where to begin.

Several years ago I invested in Bitcoin.  I started at about $800 one month and ended with $1600, so I doubled my investment.  I had a great teacher and if I kept that up I would done really well, because she had a really great strategy.  But I started doing my own thing the following month; I was 'liquidated' during a a huge drop and lost all of my investment.  It was a real bummer for me.

572,YNAB is expensive,"I saw a bunch of people suggesting YNAB but it’s $12/month?!? That’s more than I pay for netflix. Wondering why it’s so much, if it’s really worth it, and why so many people suggest it?

Edit: LMAO SOME OF YALL ARE FUNNY. It was honest question to see why some people like it vs why some don’t. But some of y’all are talking like it’s a cult. And downvoting people for saying they didn’t like it or didn’t wanna pay? Childish lol

Maybe I already have a good grasp on how to budget and that’s why I’m so shocked. Maybe this app is better for people new to budgeting or people in debt. I’m happy they found something that works. I pay more for Headspace each month. Some people might judge me for that, but it helps me. **I am not here to judge you for what works for you.** I am just trying to have an honest discussion because I was curious about the hype behind YNAB.

573,Advice and help for getting mortgage with friend,"Hello I need some help with getting a mortgage. I want to make sure that everything that my friends and I are planning on doing is totally legal. I don't really understand too much about mortgages but I'm trying to read up on it as much as possible. 

So my fiance (27M), our best friend (27M), and me (24F) currently live together  (renting a house) and are looking at buying a house together. We all have a great relationship together, extremely close and never had any issues with anybody paying expenses or rent. Friend is like a brother to us and we trust him with our lives. My fiance and I are going to two different med schools this coming year and have to commute from a city that is equal distances to both schools. To make sure we both have a similar commute time we have to stay in/around this city where the rental prices are insane and it would be significantly cheaper to buy a house (including cost of mortgage payments, insurance, 1% maintenance fees per year) as well as having a better place to live with more control over our place. We are all really tired of renting and would rather be able to do more decorating and I want to have a backyard for our dog and more space and be able to plant a garden. Our friend is planning on staying with us for 1-2 years  at least(he works for a big tech company that went remote for covid and said he could remain working remote if he wants to even after the pandemic) and most likely move out before fiance and I get married.  

We all wanted to coborrow on the mortgage but my fiance has a lower credit score than us (720) and our best friend has credit score of 777 and income of 150K/ year but has a nontraditional credit history as he doesn't have all three credit scores. I don't currently have a job because I recently graduated and lost my research job because of covid and I have had a hard time finding another  as I also have an autoimmune so ive been too worried about applying to anything with a lot of public interaction. however i had enough money saved up and received unemployment benefits to be able to pay my expenses.  My credit score is high though at 766 and I have a great/longer credit history and credit scores from all three bureaus. We all have money saved up and were going to split the down payment and then split the mortgage payments until our friend moves out  after a couple years then it would be me and fiance paying mortgage payments. We plan to refinance down the road and remove our friend and add my fiance onto it later when we start residency and if we have to sell the house we will give our friend a portion of the profits or at least pay him back for his contribution to the down payment. We have both talked endlessly about pros and cons, possible issues and solutions to these and will write out a contract for each of us to sign so we have a written agreement. 

1. Is there anything illegal about what we are planning on doing?  
2. Will me being added as a coborrower with better credit history even though slightly lower credit score be okay if i don't have any income? Will it be an issue that we are just friends and not family members or partners?

However, I *can* afford to pay on them , and it will only help up in the long term by sending 100% of our payment to principle, so I decided to start making some payments. Further, I realized that when making extra payments as this counts as, that I can elect which loan to pay. It obviously makes the most sense to pay off the highest interest ones first.

How should she go about fixing this. She wants to pay taxes even though she fucked up by not for the last 4-5 months. I am guessing she will need to have her employer do some annoying paperwork and possibly pay back taxes. She definitely made about $12,200 this year including the untaxed nannying pay.

581,Help choosing 401k funds,"I've gone through the wiki and I'm still having some trouble figuring out what to do with my 401k. I'm in my early 20s and am fortunate to be making $130,000 so I would like to max out my 401k and IRA.

Ideally I was looking to invest in a target date fund like this sub suggests, but I only have the Fidelity Freedom (non-index) funds available which have a 0.50% expense ratio. I have the option to pay $100 per year for BrokerageLink which would allow me to invest in anything (like a lower expense ratio target date fund). Doing some basic math it looks like the difference in fees (0.50% vs ~0.16%) breaks even with the $100 annual fee after 2 years.

So should I deal with the higher-cost funds for now and then switch to BrokerageLink when it makes sense? If it is cheaper to just build my own I am happy to do that but I am a little lost. Here are my investment options:

| Name                         | Category      | Expense Ratio |
|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| FID 500 INDEX (FXAIX)        | Large Cap     | 0.02%         |
| FID BLUE CHIP GR K6 (FBCGX)  | Large Cap     | 0.45%         |
| FID EXTD MKT IDX (FSMAX)     | Mid-Cap       | 0.04%         |
| BNYM SM CAP VAL I (STSVX)    | Small Cap     | 1.02%         |
| HTFD SM CAP GROWTH Y (HSLYX) | Small Cap     | 0.87%         |
| FID INTL DISCOVERY K (FIDKX) | International | 0.91%         |
| FID INTL INDEX (FSPSX)       | International | 0.04%         |
| FID TOTAL BOND (FTBFX)       | Income        | 0.45%         |
| FID GOVT MMKT (SPAXX)        | N/A           | 0.42%         |

Judging by the wiki it seems I should have

* 10% FID TOTAL BOND (bonds)
* 51% FID 500 INDEX (80% of US stocks, large cap)
* 12% some small/mid cap (which ones?) (20% of US stocks)
* 27% international (which ones?) (30% of total stock allocation)

Does that seem about right? I'm still unsure about the small/mid cap and international choices.

Also, my employer does not offer matching but does offer a Roth 401k so I am thinking of doing Roth so my gains aren't also taxed (and I can't imagine taxes getting much lower, even if I retire in a slightly lower bracket).

So, what should I do? Should I try balancing my own 401k or does it make sense to use the target date funds? Or is there another option I am missing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l64dox/help_choosing_401k_funds/,1611753801.0,1,1,0
582,Higher mortgage rate to have closing covered?,"
Hey PF. If anyone has any experience with this, I’d greatly appreciate your input. My wife and I had our offer accepted on a home. We’re working with a mortgage broker to get financing squared away, and he’s provided us with some options. I didn’t anticipate there being options, I just thought you looked for and accepted the lowest rate you could find. This would be for a conventional, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. 

Here’s are the specifics:

Our offer was accepted at $562,000. We have, right now, $75,000 earmarked for down payment and everything else due at closing. I can potentially pull the estimated raw closing costs ($5,800), year of homeowners insurance premiums ($1,400ish) and property tax escrow ($3,000ish) from a taxable brokerage account, but I’d rather not. 

The options are (1) pay $350 to get a loan at 2.5% and pay all closing costs ourselves, (2) accept a 2.625% loan and have $2900 in closing costs covered, or (3) accept a 2.75% loan and have all closing costs ($5800) covered. In all options we would obviously still be responsible for insurance and tax escrow. 

I’ve been racking my brain trying to figure out which is mathematically better. Option 1 saves us $66 per month or $23,760 over the course of the loan. But that savings is reduced with extra payments, becomes less valuable with inflation, and goes away if we sell. I’m assuming interest rates won’t be this low again, so ever refinancing is likely out, and if we move any new mortgage will likely have a higher interest rate. Option 3 costs us $23,760 more over the life of the loan, but that is also reduced with extra payments. The $5800 that we’d save in closing costs could be additional down payment (still not enough to get us over 20%), or I could toss it into Vanguard and let it grow—presumably at a rate that would make it worth far more than $23,760 over 30 years. Then again, that pool of money won’t be worth as much as it seems due to inflation, and any earning will be taxed. 

At this point, I’m leaning toward option 2 simply because it splits the difference. I’d obviously rather choose the best option, but I’d rather be half wrong than fully wrong. 

Am I missing anything? Does choosing properly require knowing unknowable things (e.g., how long we’d be in the home, what future interest rates, inflation, and investment gains would be).

586,Sprint will not cancel account,"I’m sorry is this doesn’t apply or is not the right place, I am just exasperated.

In August my wife and I called Sprint to cancel our account. We have the chat logs where we clearly indicate our desire and intent to cancel. We were told we can only cancel by calling their number, which we abide by and proceed to do.

During this phone call, there was a verbal dispute with the representative as she was adamant they could not prorate the cancellation, and even though I was cancelling in August we would be charged for the entire billing cycle, with our final bill coming Sept 21st.

We received our final bill, and waited until Oct to pay it off. 

After we paid it off, unbeknownst to us, they reactivated one of the lines and continued to charge us, this was done without any authorization or consent, after we explicitly stated our desire to cancel and even after an argument about why the cancellation date couldn’t be sooner than September.

Since the account was considered closed, we did not know about the charges or the reactivation until we received a letter from Sprint saying that our account was passed due and headed to collections.

Since we received this letter, we have called 5 additional times, each time we call we “cancel”, or at least are given the run around and taken through the entire cancellation process. We are told that the cancellation is guaranteed, and that we need to discuss with collections to take care of the outstanding debt (they can’t do anything since they sent it off).

Well today, I just received another letter, notifying us on more charges, and the dates of service show Dec 22- Jan 22.

How can we call 5/6 times to cancel service, and then they refuse to cancel and continue to charge us month after month?

What options of recourse do we have to put this issue to bed and remove this from our credit report?

Sprint has been zero help during this entire process, and it feels like we are being fraudulently charged for accounts that we did not authorize?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5kci6/sprint_will_not_cancel_account/,1611686264.0,27,27,0
587,Deciding between two Job Offers (financially focused). WWYD?," All- I’m in a fairly complicated life-cross roads right now and being that this is a finically driven situation and the replies on here have seemed to be from people that would understand, I felt this sub would a great place to ask for input.
 
 So, first the driver of this question: I’m 46m who started late in setting up for retirement. I’m a relatively high wage earner, but only have about 15K in 401K (although i have a currently paying out “retirement” from the US military equal to about $36K that increases 1-3% every year). I feel very very behind. I do have a decent emergency fund established.

  I work at a mid sized private manufacturer based in the Midwest US and have been here for about 18 months. Relocated from Boston and was brought in as a Sr Manger and was just made a Director last week. Last Nov, a former employer reached out to me on linkedin saying he had a DIR level role for me at his new company and he thought I would be a great fit. As I hadn’t been promoted yet, I started the process. Two months (and 10 interviews) later I’m getting the written offer today. I’m really confused and I’m desperate for input as its not a black and white situation for me. I’m not unhappy where I’m at, but also I’m not financially where I should be for retirement. 

  Looking at the below, I can’t tell if the two offers are a wash. If I’m looking at from a strategic/ retirement standpoint does it make a difference? I’m maxing out 401K in both and I qualify for nothing else tax advantaged.

Can any of you fine people take a look at the two situations below and give your feedback on what you would do? I would be really grateful.

Situation:
Current:
Base: 150K
Bonus: 10%
401k match 4%
100% remote
Vacay: 20 days
No other benefits

New Offer:
Base: 175K
Bonus: 20%
401k Match: 6%
Sign on Bonus: 20K
Stock Options and long term incentive plan
Full managed relocation.
In office
Vacay: Unlimited
90 day temp housing

PROs of Staying:
- Job is fairly safe.
- I have a large beautiful home  here (albeit with no one around and far far too big for just me)
- Working remote is nice (though lonely)
- I’m generally well thought of, and was promoted to a DIR level within my first 18 months.
- I pretty much get full autonomy to run my department how i see fit
Cons:
- Location is in fairly remote suburbia. I’m a single guy, and its pretty socially dead here. 
- My pay wont move much from here for awhile (minus 3% every year maybe).
- Its professionally frustrating place to worK and I don’t enjoy the industry. Getting things done is pretty hard and the company isn’t ran that well.

PROs of Going:
- Financially it’s just a better deal overall. The benefits are significantly better. My ability to invest for retirement goes up a lot. This industry comps WELL.
- Large well know, public Fortune 500 company in a reputable industry (biotech). I will grow for sure here.
- Upward mobility. Lots of room to move up.
- Location is a well known large US city. Socially its far more adventitious. COL is similar though, maybe slightly higher. This is actually a big driver of this option to be honest.
- My new boss is an old manager of mine. So we know each other

Cons:
- New job and all that comes with that. There’s more risk.
- Location isn’t as safe as where I’m at now.
- The work will be somewhat difficult here (where its fairly easy where I’m at now. Sometimes boring though).
- I was recently promoted to my current role here (hasn’t even been made public yet). So resigning will burn ALL the bridges.
- Housing isn’t as available or as nice as where I’m at now.

593,Mom diagnosed with terminal brain cancer with poor prognosis. Case workers are claiming that she needs to do 2 weeks of inpatient rehab for the insurance to cover her treatment.,"Just after Christmas, my mom was unexpectedly diagnosed with grade IV glioblastoma. We immediately met with a neurosurgeon who recommended a craniotomy to remove a golf-ball sized tumor that was pressing on her motor and prefrontal cortex, which he performed shortly after. Prior to the surgery, she had the same issues with her fine motor skills on that side, and she saw a major improvement after 2 weeks of an anti inflammatory steroid. The neurosurgeon himself said we could expect her coordination and motor skills to improve as the swelling goes down. The case worker however keeps saying that the internal medicine doctor strongly recommends inpatient rehab and to go home instead would be leaving AMA. Her prognosis is short—about 9 months—so during what could be our last good 2 weeks together before she begins treatment and potentially gets sicker, she’ll be in a care facility that doesn’t allow visitors.

Overall, my question is if there’s any way to speak to her insurance provider so that her treatment thus far (and oncology) will be covered if she declines the inpatient rehab, or if we have any further recourse. We are located in TX.

Thanks in advance.

Some clarification: the case worker is pushing for the inpatient PT because she has very little spatial awareness/fine motor skills on her left hand/arm. She is able to walk and do everything else, but she does have trouble doing a few essential tasks given her limited mobility. I am a college student that recently moved back in at home to take care of and spend time with her, and with a little bit of help from me she’s very much able to do her everyday routine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l51n2x/mom_diagnosed_with_terminal_brain_cancer_with/,1611620446.0,767,767,0

My initial investment is approx £5500. You may have seen in news recently but a particular stock is going through the roof and my portfolio is now well above the 12300 threshold for capital gains(CG). I also have an ISA but this is separate and most interest has been made in my general investment account due to the unexpected success.

I am getting confused on what I pay tax on. Is the 12300 separate to my day to day income from my normal job?
Do I pay 20% on literally everything in the general investment account, or just 20% on the interest I made on the initial investment, or 20% on the initial investment but ignore the interest? Or something else? Do I only pay tax if I withdraw the money from the platform (I use freetrade).

601,How to politely decline a family-friend selling life insurance?,"I reached out to a long-time family friend for financial guidance, knowing that their business is really on selling life insurance. Their plans has certainly benefitted my parents but my parents says they no longer have the plan since we are all older and independent, so they are trustworthy. We did the typical song-and-dance and got some good financial advice during first few meetings, and we just finished their proposals of whole / term / index life insurance. We said its interesting and would think about it.

The proposal is to rollover a partial amount of my older employers 401ks (blend of pre-tax and Roth) to one of those plans (they recommended term). I am intrigued about the flexibility of pulling some money from it, now that we are soon to be homeowners and would great to pull with minimal penalties and taxes in case of emergencies . However, I think the Trad & Roth IRA would certainly have a better RoR and would like to move forward with that.

So the two things I'd like to get feedback on:

1. Is the plan to proceed with the rollover of former employee 401ks to IRAs better? Even without the term life insurance flexibility to withdraw?

Hi, I visited a physical therapist for my ankle sprain and the front desk took my insurance card (Aetna EPO) to check if they were in network. She said in a call that they were and my charges for office consultation as well as physical therapy sessions would be $40 each. 

I agreed and started treatment. In 2 days I recieved a claim decline of $390 for office consultation in the Aetna Health app and $550 for one physical therapy session! 

When I emailed the office receptionist she said, “You will have to wait to see if you get any statements from our office. I think what you see is just what the claim is being sent for by the billing department. When we call for benefits they give us general benefits but sometimes the benefits will have some differences depending on the service billing codes so always good to cross check with insurance directly.

But for now I would suggest that you wait for statements from our billing office. Let me know if you have further questions.”

604,First time home buyer being priced out of the market.,"We live in New York. My fiancé and I have been looking to buy a home. We have been pre-approved for a mortgage totaling up 440,000 with the taxes at 12,000 per year (Long Island is very expensive, and this is pretty much the average cost of homes here). 

The problem we are having is that we can’t even get in to look at houses, by the time they hit the market they accept an offer within one day. People are moving to Long Island from NYC in droves and buying up all this property for tens of thousands of dollars over asking price. For example we found a house that is in our area and it literally sold for $50,000 over the asking price when it was maybe only really worth 70% of what it sold for. It’s a  1,200 square foot ranch, on .25 acre, that needs a ton of work (new bathrooms, kitchen, flooring, needs a roof). Listed at 429,000 and sold for 485,000. This is happening with literally every house.

It’s not like our search criteria is crazy we’re just looking for literally a livable home, in a decent area, with an ok school district (kids in the future). I understand that this is a really hot market at the moment, but I can’t believe how fast these houses are selling. 

The reason we aren’t looking out of state is because both of us have careers here, and our entire families, our friends, and entire lives are set up here.

We have until April at our current place and have to be out by April 30th. We started looking back in August, and it’s been consistently the same story. 

Appreciate any help or advice, because we’re getting really frustrated with the Long Island housing market. We can’t even get in to put an offer in! Thanks so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l65swv/first_time_home_buyer_being_priced_out_of_the/,1611758363.0,0,0,0

I am trying to pay for top surgery because my insurance explicitly denies trans coverage. The cost will be about $12,000. From what all I can find on the site, it is possible to get 60 months through Care Credit for purchases above $2500, but I don’t see where that can be done or how. Really I don’t see any advice other than “Apply today!” for where to start.

So in order to do this, do I apply for Care Credit at the surgeon’s office to get “promotions” (because I read about there being promotions that exist for Care Credit but not where to find them)? Will I know what I am approved for (aka will I know if I got approved for 60 months) before it actually opens? Calling Care Credit themselves only had the options of “Apply now” or “Put in your account number to proceed” so there was no option to talk to a representative without putting in an account number. 

I have pretty good credit (high 600s, was 770 before student loan accounts opened) and I’m very good with money, and I’m aware of the “catch” with Care Credit/deferred interest. But I can’t for the life of me find where to start?

630,Should I take out a mortgage to invest?,"The last few years I’ve been very aggressive about paying down my debt, and paid off everything, including my mortgage this year. However, as a consequence the bulk of my net worth is tied up in equity in my house (70%)

This seems like a bad strategy as I’m at least 10 or 15 years from retirement. I’m considering taking out maybe fifty percent of my home equity in a 15 year fixed jumbo loan and simply investing it in an index fund.

Worst case scenarios worry me however. If the markers tanked and I lost my job simultaneously I could be hit with the necessity of paying off the loan when the market is down.

631,Setting Up My Parent's Retirement,"Hi Everyone, 

&#x200B;

I am 23 years old wanting to help my parents set up/grow their retirement account (they are both turning 51 this year). My dad has around 60K in his 401K from his previous company--he quit his job to become a freelancer 5 years ago. My mom works part-time and has nothing set up for her retirement. 

What method would be best for them to grow & contribute to a retirement account? Would it be to roll over the 401K to a Roth IRA? Invest directly in the market? Currently they have 3\~6 months of expenses saved and haven't been putting aside any money towards their retirement in years.

632,Tricky auto insurence situation,"Hey everyone! So, I have been driving for 12-years and got into my first car accident yesterday. It was very minor - I backed into someone else's vehicle in a parking lot. I'm at fault here. What's tricky to me is I'm not sure whether I should use insurance or not. Here's why:

I was driving my girlfirend's car (with her permission). We both have GEICO. Not knowing how auto insurance works, I initially filed this through my policy on the scene. The next day, GEICO called and I was instructed that my gf would need to file it under her policy as it was her car. So we filed it under her insurence.

She has $1,000 deductible on collision and no deductible, full coverage on liability. I was speaking to my coworker about this and he advised that I settle this outside of insurance so my gf's rate wouldn't go up as the damage was minor and would likely cost less than the premium increase overtime. I called the man who's vehicle I hit, discussed these options with him, and he got a quote for the damages on his car, around $600 which is reasonable. My gf's car will need some painting on the bumper as well.

We discussed the possibility of just not going through insurance with GEICO, asking if we could just cancel the claims. They said we could, but it wouldn't change anything because they had been aware of the accident the rates may still go up. They also told us that they don't know for sure *if* the rates will go up, and *if* they do, how much they would go up by. 

In terms of accident forgiveness, my gf hasn't been in an accident in 5-years but was ""forgiven"" for her last accident. 

How do you think I should move forward here? What are my options?

I gave the collections agency a call in order to get my account number since I never received any information about the debt in the mail, by email, or by phone.

It turns out it is a small medical bill from 11 months ago that I never paid. I didn't remember ever receiving the bill, so when I asked the agent how they contacted me about it they said a letter was sent to my address. It turns out that the address they had on file was one that I haven't lived at in over 7 years....

It is a small amount ($157) and I am able to pay it, but I'm not sure how that will affect my score as I am unfamiliar with how derogatory marks on credit work. Should I dispute the debt and reach out to the doctor's office directly to pay it on the grounds that I never received a bill? Or does paying the collections agency now in full have the same effect?

The wife and I are coming to the end of our rope and are looking for some advice on how we might be able to fix our problems.

Two years ago, my wife lost her $120k a year job. At the time, I was doing contract work without a fulltime job.

We've attempted to set up a payment plan with them, but the monthly payments are out of our budget, and we have no idea what to do.

We've sold stuff and we've downsized, but our income currently is enough to pay our monthly bills and some other debts we have outside the IRS.

What can we do? Are these tax relief places trustworthy?

649,15.49% Car Loan Interest Rate!? SOS,"I need some advance on how to proceed with a high-interest car loan. Five days ago, I went to a Toyota dealership to check out a used car that caught my attention online. The car’s price was listed at $16,750, and according to Kelly Blue Book, it was a good deal. However, considering that I am a 19-year-old student, the salesman really took advantage of my lack of knowledge and a dire need for a car. First, he sat me down and told me he was going to crunch the numbers and file the paperwork, so I gave him my basic information (e.g., SSN, address, etc.). After a while, he came back with an estimated total and the interest rate was set at 19% for a 71-month loan. Additionally, there was a $2,200 “warranty” included on the statement, and I was shocked. I looked at the paper in shock because I didn’t realize my credit score (680) would give me such an awful deal. I asked the salesman why there was a $2.2k warranty included in the estimated statement and he said, “the bank won’t loan you the money if you don’t take it,” and I realized that was BS. After that, I asked him to give me a minute to think about it, and he said “I’ll send the finance rep over to get you started,” so after waiting 45 mins, the finance rep finally comes and shows me the same estimate paper. I told him: “this $2,200 warranty isn’t sitting right with me. I don’t want it, and I’ve never heard of someone having to take a warranty to get a loan. Please show me where the lender stated that I need it, or sign a paper stating that I need it to get a loan!” After that, he got nervous and said “I’ll go talk to my manager to see what I can do.” 1 hour and 35 mins later, he comes back and says, “let's go to my office and get this done.” And I told him, “If the warranty is still there, I will not buy the car” and he replied, “let me show you what I did.” 

Me thinking he got rid of the warranty because I made it clear that I did not want it, I proceeded to sit in his office. After that, he typed some things up on his computer and showed me that he had “adjusted” my loan. On the screen, he brought my interest rate down from %19 to %15.49 and decreased the warranty from $2,200 to $1,600. ON TOP OF THAT, he added GAP insurance that was $1,150. He went on a huge rant about doing his best to help me, and how that was the best he could offer. So, I said “okay, could you write on a paper that I’m required to accept the warranty and sign it” and he got so defensive and said “NO! It’s because we lose money when we sell you a car and this makes up for it.” At that point, I was exhausted from being at the dealer for 5+ hours and staying after closing time, so I was convinced that maybe he was being honest because at the end of the day he wants to go home too. 

Finally, I accepted, signed all the documents, and took the car home that same night. I ended with a %15.49 interest rate on a loan of $19,200 something, $1,150 GAP insurance, and a $1,600 drive train warranty. Keep in mind, I gave a $2,250 down payment, so all in all, I paid $21,000 something for the car that was supposed to be $16,200 (+tax). After financing, I’m going to end up paying $31,000 ($10k financing) over the next 71 months. Meaning my monthly payment is going to be $412 JUST FOR THE CAR. 

I know I should have rejected this from the start, but it was my first time going to a dealer and I did it all alone. I had no one to co-sign because my parents have bad credit. They did offer to help me pay for the car and back me up when I don’t have the money, but I feel played. $31,000 for a car that’s worth half that price??? Don’t get me wrong, I liked the car, and it only had 70k miles, but WTF. I feel like I set myself up for financial ruin... any advice on how to proceed with my purchase? Or any advice on refinancing?

663,"Financial, domestic issues. Need advice on how to proceed.","Good evening reddit,

I am 33M and I moved to Houston, Texas in January 2020 and began the electrical trade. I totaled my car in May. I have been getting to work with my cousin who i live with as well who drives a work truck for the company. So we are around each other day in and out.

My cousin is a marine veteran and has PTSD. He gets angry very easily. Well it got to the point where we were in an argument about tools which led to me getting punched in the face at work. He isn't fired, I took vacation to work on my car. My boss wants to separate us at work but that would require me to find a ride/finish fixing car.

The car (honda civic 2013) was given to me by my mom after she paid it off. It has a side collision on the passenger wheel/fender area. I have the axle and wheel removed. I need to buy a steering knuckle so I can reinstall the steering system and get it running/see what else it needs.

My problem is that we are behind on this month's rent which was due the 1st. I have had my side of rent ready but I can't pay the rent if he doesn't have his. I made an arrangement to pay January and February's rent on the 3rd of Feb. About $900 each. He said he will have his portion.

My lease is up in 60 days so I plan to end it and send the notice here tomorrow.

I have tried to help my cousin despite his struggles with emotions and finance. Help by putting my name on the lease because he has a record.  Taking care of his dog by walking him every day because he is heavier set and struggles with his lower back slipped disc. Doing whatever I can to help, but I feel he has taken advantage of me. He always asks me for money when he makes more than me. He never cleans, and I feel I have made a mistake coming here.

I plan to move back to florida in April. I would like to know if anyone has any strategies on how to get out of this situation. I have 200$ on cashapp, my bank is negative 180. I get a direct deposit of 350 tomorrow evening from work. I missed a day of work so this check is short because I fell on a roof doing side work for a PAST DEBT of his and landed on a roof beam and had to get staples.

I know I am placing a lot of blame on him when I am the one who committed to these terms. I don't want to break the lease and ruin my credit for 7 years. I was relying on the second stimulus check to come in but it didn't come in and the IRS says my second payment status is unavailable and I received the first. I didn't work in 2019 enough to file taxes so I'm thinking that's it. I plan to file taxes the 12th of Feb when the IRS is ready.

Can anyone give me advice on a path I can take? The stress has fogged me and the family I have reached out to is all in Florida and not really able to help. 

Your suggestions/words/thoughts/prayers are greatly appreciated. Thank youHave a blessed day.

First generation college &amp; grad student, 23M, and graduated in May 2020 from Engineering grad school and received my Master's. I was very lucky to land a job in August and started in September of last year. I live in a place that's LCOL.

Income: 90k (Pre tax)

Rent: 600 Monthly \*Temporary housing\* (will be moving in a month and will pay 1000 for a new apt)

Car loan: 10.5k ( 3.25% apr for used car); monthly payment 450ish for a 24 month period. 

Federal Student loan: 23.5k (initially) but now it’s 18k (sigh student loans suck; BUT forbearance so 0% interest wohoo)

Credit card debt: 2.2k (distributed across 4 credit cards)

I have a 401k (10% match from employer, I contribute 10% of my salary) and an HSA which I contribute since I started my job 5 months ago. 

For context: I have not had financial backing from parents since I left for college (except for when I graduated from my master's to look for a job - I lived in their place for a few months) and so when I relocated for my new job I had to pay for new furniture, travel and initial costs and other logistical costs.

As the title says, can anybody ELI5 what this all means to me and what the implications are?

TL;DR: First time getting form 3922 for 423(c) ESPP plan, sold first batch of ESPP shares in 2020 as quickly as I could and held on to the second batch of ESPP shares. Previous years I just did quicksell and took the hit to income taxes.

I've been participating in my company's ESPP program purchasing shares with a 2-year window at a 15% discount from market price. Since I started with the company I have been immediately selling the shares and taking a hit on taxes.

In 2020, I sold the shares from the first purchase window but held onto the shares from the second purchase window.

Getting to the title... Today I got a form from ETrade titled ""Transfer of Stock Acquired Through an Employee Stock Purchase Plan Under Section 423(c)"" and indicating it is Form 3922. I've never received this form in the mail before.

On this form I see all of the shares purchased through ESPP in 2020, even the ones that were sold swiftly. Unfortunately both purchase dates happened to fall within a blackout window for earnings announcements, so quick sell was disabled.

What does this form mean to me? What are the tax implications from this form? I have looked up the code but don't understand the implications of it. It doesn't look to me like the numbers on the form would fall under the provisions of 423(c).

I was never taught how to plan for 401ks and this is my first job that offered it. For my first year, I was hourly at ~$26/hr. I put my 401k at 3% before tax and 3% roth savings (which is now currently 5% before and 3% after). Now I got a recent promotion and I make 64k per year salary. I can now contribute more but I am not exactly how much. I plan on maxing out my Roth IRA for 2020 and 2021 and onwards but not sure how much % to put in for 401(k) and whether I should put in before tax or after tax. I don’t have much bills to pay but I was paying $1000 towards my student loans per month (roughly $300 expected per month). I had a lower contribution rate for my 401k at the time as I needed the money to pay back the principal as fast as possible. However, I have stopped paying my student loans once they frozed them but I did save my money during this time to pay the rest off (~$20,000) in one go. I haven’t paid it off yet since it will be frozen until Sept. 2021 and I might as well wait and see if the new administration somehow and miraculously approves a student loan forgiveness of some sort. I also don’t have much expenses either. 

Well back to my main question, how much should I contribute to my 401(k) or how much is recommended? I also plan on maxing out my Roth IRA every year onwards as that is my priority. I am also confused about what my company means by “an employer match of 100% of my contributions up to 4% of my eligible pay”? I asked my manager at the time how it worked but he really couldn’t tell me. In the end, I focused more on paying off my student loans that year. Also, is it better to put more % into before tax or the roth 401k? I wasn’t sure so I did a split between both at the time. 

Also I am currently 25 yo and according to my projected expectations for my current contributions, I am “projected” to get about roughly $73,200 per year from my 401k when I retire at age 65.

I handed my phone around so people could order what they want and then left the room and when I came back my fiancé said she couldn’t pay with Apple Pay (needed to pass the Face ID), so she just used the card I had saved on the Postmates app. I figured “ok cool, no big deal it’s probably just my debit card” because I that’s how I have it set up on all my other delivery apps. I don’t think anything of it until I checked my score recently.

It dropped by over 80 points. It turns out the card saved on the Postmates app was for a credit card from a regional bank (a region that I no longer live in) that I never use, never check, and that I don’t have auto pay set up with because it won’t let me link an outside bank account to pay the balance (I used to have a checking account with them and would have to transfer money to that account every time to pay it). Every time I want to pay the balance on this card I have to call and give them my checking account over the phone, so naturally I never use this card.

They reported it as 30 days late, and when I called to pay off the balance and see if there was anything they could do about the report they said no dice, try filing a dispute with the credit bureau. 

Am I just totally fucked here? Is this one stupid mistake of not paying this balance that I didn’t even know existed really going to ding my credit like that, because I’ve now made on time payments 371/372 times? I’m so pissed but feel like filing a dispute isn’t going to get me anywhere since it’s not an incorrect report. I was late. Do I have any recourse here or do I just wait five years for my credit to go back up? Also I’ve had this card since 2016.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5tij9/help_with_getting_late_payment_removed_from/,1611712462.0,3,3,0

687,Why do I owe so much in federal taxes when I'm claiming single 0?,"I've been doing taxes for quite a few years now and I always jump to file through TurboTax as soon as I have my W2(s). Most years I've had two W2s (I was a student worker for 6 years and had a second job for 4), and I've never had to pay federal taxes, and I always pay a small amount to the state (I live in California, figures).

But, for my 2020 taxes, I have three W2s -- the last semester of my university job, a temp agency, and a company I now work full time for. I've always filed single 0 on my W4s to get the most back from my taxes, and it's never been an issue until this year.

I entered my university and full time job W2s first, and I was set to receive $500+ from federal, which was looking great. Then, I entered my temp agency W2, and suddenly I OWED federal $192, which blew my mind. I made the most money at the temp agency in 2020, but only a few thousand more than at my now-full time job. I double checked the temp W2 and I definitely paid plenty of taxes to state and federal for that job, so I'm not sure why I essentially ""owe"" $700+ to the federal government.

I read somewhere that filing with multiple W2s can cause you to owe federal taxes, but again I've almost always filed with 2 every fiscal year so this doesn't make sense even now that I have 3 and filed single 0 for all of them. Is this just how it is? Did I do something wrong, or is there anything I can do to double check this and not owe any federal taxes?

691,"Is FBGRX a good mutual fund for me? If not, what would a better option be?","I read a few guides, look for low fees, under 50% turnover, etc. But choosing a mutual fund is just so overwhelming especially since I'm just starting and it's not like I have lots of money to diversify.

I'm not risk adverse (if that's the right term). I'm currently working overseas (but I am a US citizen) so the only option available to me seemed to be investing through my bank (Chase YouInvest). the other companies I looked at seemed to require that I have a job in the United States. Even Chase asked me about my job, and in the end I just put that I'm unemployed... Will that get me into trouble? they approved my account and took the funds from my account, now I just need to choose a fund it seems.

My goal is that I think I'm going to want to go back to school and get a Master's degree in something useful, but I don't want to take out any student loans. It also seems a bit silly to put the money into a savings account and let it sit interest free when I could invest it. I'm not risk adverse, I'm thinking that I'll probably invest at least 1000 a month regularly for the next 2-3. But probably more. I realize based on everything I read that that's not a long time for a mutual fund, and that's ok. if at the end of 2-3 years, if my portfolio is down, I'll just leave it in there for another year, another 2 years and keep depositing. Maybe I'll end up leaving it in there for another 30 years. Based on everything I've read, if I'm willing to wait, eventually I'll come out ahead. Returning to school isn't something I MUST do in the next 5 years, but mutual funds seem to be a good place to park money when saving up for a car or a house. or any other big expense like returning to college.

If you made it this far, I appreciate you. I'm ready to start investing. my account with Chase is ready, FBGRX seems like a good fund. But based on searching Reddit about it, others say it, and other large growth funds, is ""Bullish?"" now but probably won't be much longer. Based on it's history that certainly seems to be the case. They tend to recommend other things like ITOT? but when I try to find those, I can't. Will someone hold my hand for a little and help me navigate this?

I don't think this is an open-ended question in regards to the rules because I'm asking about a specific fund. I've seen similar questions to mine asked in the past. If asking for alternative recommendations is considered open-ended, feel free to ignore that part and just explain if FBGRX is a good or bad fund and why? I'll be appreciative of that.

According to him, no bank is willing to give him an account because of several issues; loans, history, etc.etc. (I don’t really know/care for the specifics). He is an architect contractor, and he has his clients pay him by sending money to my Venmo and Bank account. When he needs money, I send it to the people he lives with, and they pull it out to give to him. (Parents are divorced and lives across the state, 6hrs away).  

Now he has been asking me to open a checking account, under my name, and let him use the debit card. So that he can financially do things independently (if I’m wording that correctly). But I’ve expressed concerns that it might potentially affect me in some negative way. But he tells me nothing can affect me.

Or… since he trades with Charles Schwab, he asked if we can apply for the Debit card, so that he can use the Charles Schwab as a type of “bank” for himself.

We are looking for a 3 br 2 ba in a major Midwestern city. This would be a ~5 year home for us. Historically, this would be a $150-200k home in the areas we are looking. Right now, the market is bonkers. Prices are +20% compared to last year and anything in a desirable area is gone for cash in 4 hrs, above asking, and sometimes significantly over asking. 

Early on, we set ourselves a modest budget of $225k despite being approve for $400k. We don’t want to over extend and risk being house poor.  

Since looking, we have raised our ceiling to $275k, which makes me feel uneasy given the uncharted waters of the current market. I personally don’t see prices coming down from this point, but I am not comfortable spending $300k on a house that just 2 years ago would have been $200k. It just doesn’t seem sane to me. 

However, it seems like given the market exuberance, this is just the way it is if you want a house right now. You will have to pony up more than ever before, and you just have to hope that the market stays afloat.

I know I can't claim the kids as my ""dependent children"", since they're not legally my kids. But I could claim them as non-relative dependents, right? And based on the IRS guidelines, I think I can claim her too.

But since the child tax credit is larger than the dependent tax credit, would it make more sense to have her claim the kids while I claim her? I can't seem to figure out if the child tax credit is refundable for someone who already has a zero tax liability (due to zero income)...

I want to take a loan of around $15K-$20K out of my 401K to help put money down on my first home purchase. Fidelity offers 12-180 month loans for primary residence and I would be paying 4.25% interest back to myself over the loan term.

They live in Michigan and have a very nice house (paid off) in a crappy little town of 10K people.  So, the house isn't worth a whole heck of a lot because of its location.  Maybe $300K tops?   I am in New Mexico, and they are kicking around the idea of moving down here at some point.  Neither of my siblings want the house in MI, and none of us need any inheritance to stay afloat.

Anyway, my neighbor next door has been talking about selling his place for a while.  I hatched a plan to see if he would be interested in selling it to us  (for $30K more than what he paid) and just renting it back until he finds what he's looking for.  Between his equity and increase in value, he'd have some money on hand for when he finds the property he wants.   My question is in regard to my folks' place.  For funding such a venture, would a reverse mortgage on their current house be a good option?  I am just learning about those, so I know virtually nothing.

I imagine they wouldn't want to move here full-time for at least  another 5-6 years.  If we buy the neighbor's place, we would make improvements and add one or two outbuildings in the mean time.  Being a veteran, we could always get a VA loan in my name (with them being co-signers.).   The home here would probably be around $145-150K.

Due to the age of this debt, we will not sue you for it or report payment or non-payment of it to a credit bureau”. I have received no previous communication about this debt via phone or mail. 

The debt is relatively small, but still large enough that it is raising some red flags. I check my credit reports yearly, and just ran all three - nothing on my reports shows anything from Midland, or anything from the credit card company. Nothing from previous credit reports I’ve saved show anything from Midland or the credit card company. 

I called and spoke to a rep asking for more info, explaining I was unsure what the debt was, and she was clearly trying to get me to settle for a better price, and admit to the debt. She confirmed my previous address, and social. She told me the credit card debt was purchased by Midland in 2015, and the credit card account is from late 2010. 

I did have a credit card account in 2010, and I believe that account was charged off. I cannot remember more than that, it is possible I already settled the debt in the past.

713,401k contributions company match,"Hi PF! Long time lurker with what seems like an obvious question and I’m getting myself to tangled into.

I started a new job recently and they have an unusual company match policy. My 401k’s to date have typically been a simple match % and I’ve always gone pretax as I expect my rate to be lower in retirement. 

I just started with a new company that doesn’t match percent, it matches dollars.  So under previous employers if I put it 5% of my 50k salary pretax I put in 2500 they put in 2500. If it were to be post tax I would put in say 1750 and they would match that 1750 as a post tax 5%. 5k vs 3500 but on the 3500 no taxes in retirement so if the tax rate in retirement were the same they are effectively equal.

With the new company since they are matching a dollar amount, would it be wiser to put it in post tax? Yes I would effectively be putting in more now say a full 2500 after tax and not taking the deduction now hurting the paycheck more, but getting the company to put up an equal amount to me that now won’t be taxed in retirement.

Am I viewing this right, or did I screw up the math? You guys are the pros, so any help / guidance is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5w99o/401k_contributions_company_match/,1611721417.0,1,1,0

I live in Garner, NC right outside of Raleigh, NC. Currently I live adjacent to a major shopping center so I am within walking distance to shopping, movie theater, restaurants, Target and many other places. The convenience is perfect! It's why I chose to live here initially. 

My lease ends in April and here are my current renewal options. I am a single guy with no kids and all my family/friends live within the area so I don't plan on relocating. 

3 Months $1,408

4 Months $1,300

6 Months $1,214

7 Months $1,281

8 Months $1,268

* 1% @ 52 (earliest age)
* 2% @ 62
* 2.5% (max) @ 67

If I stay with the state:

* At age 52, I'd have 22 years of service (so I'd get 22% of my high 3 salary)
* At age 62, I'd have 32 years of service, so I'd get 64% of my high 3
* At age 67, I'd have 37 years of service, so I'd get 93% of my high 3

If I retire from the state at 52:

* I am free to go work in another retirement system with no penalty.  
* For example, I could go take a federal job from age 52-67 and double dip all those years (full time federal salary plus state pension) while earning a 1% federal pension multiplier for federal years of service.

Then if I retire from the federal job at 67:

* I'd still be getting the 22% of my state high 3 but I'd also be getting 15% of my federal high 3.  I think I just answered my own question lol.  Probably not worth it.

*However*, the federal TSP is significantly better than my state 457 (TSP offers matching contributions whereas my state does not match my 457 contributions).  And the FERS employee contributions are lower than those for my state pension, which means my net salary would be higher even if the gross salary is the same (about a 3% difference at current rates).

I've known about this debt but have been putting off paying it or literally forgetting to pay because I haven't received any more written communication from them besides the original letter (which I've lost), and if they've contacted me by phone I don't know it because I don't answer calls from numbers I don't know. I'm assuming the pandemic is also playing a part in their lack of communication with me.

Essentially my questions are: Without just blindly paying the company on the credit report, how should I start to settle this debt when I never verified the debt a year ago? Should I still send a debt verification letter even though it's been a year and I don't even know the full account number with the CA? (Credit report only shows last two numbers)

I have a complicated tax situation, which I am trying to figure out myself. I understand I may need to pay somebody to help me, but the options look quite expensive. 

I have many sources of self-employed income, from multiple international clients. I also moved internationally from USA -> Germany this year. 

I understand I have a tax obligation to the USA, and a tax Obligation to Germany. My current assumption is that money earned *before* my German visa is USA income, and money earned *after* is German income. 

Two main questions:

1) I understand US is one of the few countries that tax based on citizenship, not location. How do I avoid paying double taxes on my German earnings? I don't qualify for FEIE since I didn't live here long enough.

2) Is it possible I have a tax obligation to my foreign clients? None of them withheld any tax earnings for me. I have clients in: USA, Germany, Canada and Canada. After relocating, I have clients in only Netherlands. 

3) I also own an online business, which has monthly subscription. This subscription is being taken from members all across the whole world. I don't have good location records for all clients. Is there a tax obligation here, beyond just US/German?

I'm reading a lot, but these are the questions I am struggling to answer with my Google Fu.

746,My bank is closing and I've been denied for two more accounts,"I have Simple bank and it's closing. Someone took the time out of their day to map some equivalents and the two closest to the features it had (that I have come to rely on for budgeting) I've been denied for.

They're online banks (OneFinance and Ally). OneFinance told me that it was because my phone number wasn't old enough (I've had it for 4 years) and it's under my husband's name so they said there's nothing they can do.

I tried Ally as well and was denied and I should be getting something in the mail as to why, but they told em I can apply as much as I want. I applied a second time under my maiden name (because I've only been married/had my name changes for a year and a few months) and that one wasn't denied but I am ""under review"".

I don't want to keep applying to banks and getting rejected and there doesn't seem to be a way for me to do anything else, I'm wondering if anyone has had experience with this?

My only other thought is that this year I got a mesage from the IRS earlier this year when I had to call in and confirm my identity. My CPA used to work for the IRS and told me that someone probably tried to file taxes fraudulently in my name. I keep a close eye on my credit so I haven't seen anything wild, but my credit is fine, I've never had a trouble opening financial accounts and I am the ""money maker"" in my household so I'm extremely frustrated.

747,Credit card fraud persisting even with replacement card...,"Not sure where to ask but if anyone has any theories, I'm kinda clueless...

I noticed some uber charges on my credit card a few days ago. I checked my uber account and there are no rides for the past 18 months, figure whatever someone snagged my number somehow so I'll just cancel the card. 

Well today the replacement card arrived, I add it to my online Citi account, and bam there is already an uber charge on the replacement card from today. 

How is this even possible!

I can only think of 3 places where the updated number might exist. Well, four if you count Citi (though it was not yet added to my online account so someone couldn't have gotten the number there, and the website doesn't even show the full card number).

1. Google Pay wallet
2. Samsung Pay wallet
3. Bitwarden password manager

The first two auto-update card numbers when a replacement card is issued. However neither shows any recent transactions and both have two factor auth on them. The last one I updated the new card number in when I ordered the replacement card, however it also uses two factor auth. 

I'm not sure how someone else could get the replacement card number. So far my plan is to change passwords with google, Samsung, bitwarden, Citibank and uber, and remove my credit cards from google pay and Samsung pay.

Looking at moving into a studio, but the increased cost is making me worry. How would you feel with this budget below? My current safety net is around $50k, but I am working on getting that into more investments. 



**Longer Version:**

I have to move back across the country for work. I was living with my parents for a little to save money since my lease ended. I now have to fly back to my works locations for reasons out of the scope of the question. When I lived there before, I have always lived with friends/roommates, but that isn't really an option during the pandemic and with all of them in leases already. Due to this, I have to pay a lot more than I use to and have a hard time accepting the cost. I could find a cheaper location if I needed to but I would lose out on the location benefits. I have lived very frugally and cheap the last five years out of college, so this is my first big live style step up. I am in my late 20's, no children, paid off my debts, net worth of $100k with about 50k being in cash that I am trying to work into investments. I think this is an okay lifestyle step up due to me working a lot in my apartment and having enough cash that I am not worried about not being able to pay. Still, I worry about the long-term consequences that only $750 adding to my bank account each month. Also, I want to get a dog, and that will run about $300 a month but waiting until I am confident with my budget.

However, my current company doesn't want to lose me and I have a meeting with my boss at the end of the week to discuss continuing to work for them remotely part-time, and I'm wondering what options I have to negotiate a higher salary.

I don't need any benefits from my current company as the benefits with the new company are really good. I estimate that I would put in \~10 hours/week for my current company and I would set my own work schedule (nights and weekends).

My current company is small and there is a bandwidth issue - the people who are capable of reviewing electrical drawing packages don't have enough time to do so.

Looking at posts about being an independent contractor, I saw advice saying to start at 2x my current hourly rate *at a minimum*. But I'm not sure my situation qualifies as being an independent contractor since I'll be employed indefinitely by the company, I'll be using a computer they gave me, etc.

753,"My dad needs heart surgery that has a long recovery time, likely putting an end to his business and therefore the biggest chunk of their household income. I need advice moving forward.","My dad owns and operates his own business as a sole proprietor for the past 30+ years. He's done very well for himself and our family, until about a decade ago when he was diagnosed with diabetes that went untreated for a number of years. Between this, working alone (because he can't afford to hire someone else to help him, as he has always said), and several major stressors within the family over the years including the death of my grandpa, things have been slowly spiraling downhill since.

Our whole family has been trying to get him to be healthier and focus on his health, but he would have none of it, as his excuse was always ""if I go get treated, I won't be able to work and make money to pay the bills"" or ""if I'm out of commission for a significant amount of time, we'll lose the house."" Well, last week, his health issues finally came to a head when he went to go see the doctor who told him to immediately go to the ER after running a test in the office. At the hospital, they found multiple blockages in his heart's arteries and are in talks of bypass surgery which will not only keep him in the hospital for another week, but also keep him out of work for multiple months, which basically is going to put a fork in his long running business.

Since getting this news yesterday, I've had a horrible feeling of impending doom that I haven't felt since my grandpa passed away several years ago, which was especially hard on my dad even to this day, and left us to deal with multiple issues in his wake. He and my mom (who works for him at this business and is dealing with health issues of her own) are already in talks about not being able to pay the mortgage and bills without their business operating, and how they will have to sell both and won't have anywhere to go. My sister and I still live with them, and while I have a full time job and enough saved up to rent myself, I would not be able to sustain living alone for long paying everything myself...but this is besides the fact, as I've been trying to help them pay bills for a few years by paying rent and a third of the household bills and groceries each month.

In addition to ALL of this, not only has my dad's MO for a decade been ""we have no money and barely getting by"" (no exaggeration, he's been saying this even when we had money), but they'll also have to deal with the hospital bill for his stay and operation in addition to having barely any money to pay bills, the mortgage, and any other expenses that are thrown their way as is. I'm moreso in need of advice on where to go from here financially so he can try to just get through the surgery and recover, which is the most important thing, without stressing about anything else in the meantime.

I don't want them to lose the house. The business is one thing, but assuming they bought the house nearly 30 years ago, I figure they are almost done paying it off or can refinance, but I don't know what other options there may be for the income provider who psychically can not work to make income for a significant amount of time. My parents are in their mid to late 50's, and live in PA.

Earlier this month, I attempted to purchase a car. The dealer attempted to run my credit using my Equifax report and, to my surprise, the dealer said that there was a security freeze on my file. I went online and attempted to remove this freeze, but Equifax said they couldn’t verify my identity. I called and spoke to a representative and was told I would need to mail in identity documentation and a form. So I did. Yesterday I received a letter from Equifax stating that they had no credit file for me, which I know is false because I have had 3 credit cards from major companies and a loan over the 3.5 years I have had a credit history. There are no issues with looking at my reports from the other two credit bureaus either. So, after receiving the letter, I filed a complaint with the CFPB. Then I decided to call Equifax back and requested a supervisor. After speaking with the supervisor, she said that she was unable to find the documents that I had sent despite me knowing that they were received. She asked me to fax her the documents and a letter stating all of these problems. I did so last night and now I’m just waiting to hear back. What more can be done about this?

My income is $100,000

**Individual:**

I max out IRA in Vanguard every year and on top of $20,000-$30,000 into brokerage mutual fund in Vanguard.


**Employer:**

1. Pension Plan: 6% contribution from my paycheck. 10 years of service to retire to retire at 63 without penalty.

 The Vested Retirment benefit is calculated as following:

 A. For a Participant with less than 20 years of Credited Service:1.67% times Final Average Salary (FAS) times years of Credited Service

 B. For a Participant with 20 or more years of Credited Service:35% of FAS for the first 20 years of Credited Service; plus2% times each year of Credited Service in excess of 20

 And also I had to contribute forever until either I retire or I separate from the organization which is the biggest reason I felt like I didn't want to opt into the pension. But feel free to convince me otherwise.

2. They also offer deferred 457, deferred 401k, Traditional IRA, and Roth IRA.

I bought this house in 2005 for $225000.  I owe $90k still on the loan and it is scheduled to be paid off in 2027ish. It's currently worth roughly $500000.  My payment is $1225/mo.  I refi'd to a 15 some years ago.  I've chatted with three propery management companies here in our metro area and all three say they'd rent it for ~$2500/mo.  I have no desire to manage the rental myself, so if I do this I am pretty sure I will go the property management route.

One idea is that I throw everything I have at the loan and pay it off.  Or I pay it down some then refi it to a 30 and knock that payment way down to like $300/mo and rent it out using property management.

The other idea is we sell it and buy a house about the same value and break even.

The last idea is we sell it, use all the equity and buy a bigger more expensive home.  But I am hesitant to be saddled with 30 years of mortgage payments that could quite likely outlive me at this point.  I assume by the time I retire I'd likely sell again and downgrade.  But who knows.

I qualified for federal loans to cover about $30,000 of that. Do you guys have an opinion of which company I should use to cover the rest? I'm looking at Discover, Sofi, Sallie Mae, and College Ave. It seems like they pretty much all offer similar interest rates/no origination fees/cover full tuition/similar repayment options.

773,How do I finance a mixed-use commercial/residential primary property?,"Hello everybody,

My significant other and I are looking to purchase a local property. It’s a two floor property. 

The upstairs is a 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment. 

The downstairs is a 1100 square foot area zoned for commercial use. 

This would be the first property purchase for the both of us. 

They are asking 350k. We currently have about $75k in savings. 

This would be our primary residence. 

How would we finance this? I was told a commercial mortgage would need 30% down. Could we get a conventional mortgage? I really don’t know where to start, so any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks

Edit:

The property is designated code 482. A commercial, multi-use property, which, according to the state Department of Taxation and Finance website, means it is a downtown row type without common walls, meant to feature sales or services on the first floor with offices or apartment space on upper floors. 

Is a commercial mortgage possible to get with, say, 15% down? 

I should add, this property is a walk away from a train station, but in a neighborhood among residential properties.

We would be running a salon in the commercial area.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5svyk/how_do_i_finance_a_mixeduse_commercialresidential/,1611710415.0,2,2,0

775,CDs above 1%? Am I missing something?,"Hi!

Googling around about CDs, I see posts like this from last year: [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/bv79f9/are\_certificates\_of\_deposit\_cds\_still\_worth\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/bv79f9/are_certificates_of_deposit_cds_still_worth_it/)

The comments say things about CDs with rates of 2-3% from places like Discover and Ally.

When I go to check, e.g. [https://www.ally.com/bank/view-rates/](https://www.ally.com/bank/view-rates/) or [https://www.discover.com/online-banking/cd/](https://www.discover.com/online-banking/cd/) and I see rates more like 0.85% for 5-year CDs.

I remember going through this same thing about a year ago, and the year before that, and each time never finding anything over 1% (or am I misremembering??). So I just keep my small amount of extra money (\~10k that not in my IRA or emergency fund) in my 0.5% Ally savings.

Am I missing something? Is there some way that people get close to making up for inflation that I'm just not seeing?

Thanks :)

779,Advice on obtaining a HELOC?,"My mother and I (60 & 25) have always been interested in the idea of real estate investing but we haven't been able to put together enough funds to do it the way we want to but lately she has been considering the idea of taking out a line of credit against her house (she has 100% equity) to finance our first fix and flip. We would like to borrow around 100k. As I understand it, a heloc seems like the best option for us since the cash is available from the date of approval and it can be used for whatever you want which is crucial since we are planning to purchase properties cash and have left over funds for renovations.

This has only been an idea and we haven't really consulted with anyone about it (we have a realtor friend) or spoken to anyone at the bank for approval requirements because we think that we are going to run into some hurdles. Like I mentioned her house (property is in her name) is 100% paid off, neither of us have any debt or any expenses beside utilities, entertainment and food. But we have two potential problems the lender might point out, one is that she has not used her credit to finance anything before so her credit history is just an empty blank sheet and two her source of income is a part time 5 hour a day gig that doesn't really pay much, its mostly just something to cover her day to day expenses.
Which is where I think i could come in because in any case that our investment goes south I told her I would cover her 100%. My salary is around 50k/year, I also have no debt, and have a relatively more active credit history (although only a couple years old). We havent yet spoken to her bank about requirements but what we want to know is if there is any way for us to work around the problems I mentioned in case she applies but is denied due to her income and lack of credit history. We were thinking that as a last resort she would have to transfer ownership of the house to me so that I can apply but we would like to consider other options to see which is easiest for us.

On to the situation. My girlfriend is a senior in college (22 y.o.) and I'm trying to help her file her taxes for 2020. In all previous years, her parents have claimed her as a dependent, but I'm not sure if she should be considered a dependent. 

When she was young, her grandfather created a 529 account for her. When he passed, her parents acquired the account. She works part time, and is supported by her income and the money from the 529 (her parents pay only for her car insurance). My question is, is the money in a 529 account considered support provided by the student or support provided by account owner (parental)?

If she could file as an independent, her refund would be larger, and she would qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit, which would really help her out.  I've done some digging, and it sounds like everyone has a different opinion, and the IRS hasn't officially made any statement on it.

According to an email from an IRS  rep mentioned in this thread: [https://forum.savingforcollege.com/t/distributions-from-529-plans-and-parent-support/10834/6](https://forum.savingforcollege.com/t/distributions-from-529-plans-and-parent-support/10834/6).

Reported for: Non-sufficient funds activity. This is from 4/6/17.

It's my understanding that these things stay on your Chexsystems report for 5 years. So after that this will disappear from my report? What do you think I should do?

Excluding bonuses, single and I make 130k/year. Credit score is 749-760 (FICO). Not contributing to 401k due to wanting to pay off loans first, though lenders told me to keep them around until I buy a house to make my credit mix better suited for approval.

Debts:

* $330/month public student loan (currently in covid forebearance)
* $160/month private student loan

Paid off my car this month. It's a 2017 so I'm not expecting any expenses for repairs from it. I also work remote so travel would be a future consideration if I decide to leave my current company, but that wouldn't be for at least 2 years.

Currently paying $2400/month in rent for a 2 bedroom (one room is my office), and I'm able to put away 2-3k/month into savings. Houses I've been looking at have been ranging from 400k-500k.

As much as I'd like to get a house for my dog, and have more space, and due to living in an area that has appreciated 8-12% over the last 4 years, it seems like a good idea. 

I'm just not sold if it is a sound financial choice without 20% down. It would take me 2 years of saving to save up 20% (plus closing costs, earnest money, moving costs, etc)

My current lease expires this summer, so saving up even 10% would be by next fall or winter, meaning my month to month payment on my lease would go up to over 3k/month, with a 60 day notice to vacate.

802,Looking for insight on 401K allocations.,"My employer is finally matching employees (only up to 1% of total income but whatever) and so I'm jumping on board. They had two options, ""before-tax"" and ""Roth 401(k)"". I opted to contribute 0% to ""before-tax"" and 10% to Roth. As for allocation (percentage), below are my options. I have no idea what any of this means and am looking for insight. Advice would be helpful of course, but I really just want to understand what it all means. I am 29 and am okay with starting aggressively to play catchup. Thank you for any help/information.

* VFFVX is currently slightly more risky since the allocation is 90% stock and VASGX is 80%. I can handle this risk.

* VFFVX has slightly higher expense ratio of .15% compared to VASGX's .14%.

* VFFVX has a lower initial investment minimum of $1000 compared to VASGX's $3000.

I would only invest a few thousand initially since I may buy a house in less than 5 years. I would not plan to use any of the money funding this account for the home purchase. I don't have any immediate goals with the money used/earned in this investment account.

814,Should I sell investments to pay off credit card debt?,"Hi all, I'm hoping you all can give me some advice on proceeding to pay off credit card debt.  Over the past few years I went from paying off my credit card in full every month to carrying a little debt, to the point where I am now at about $10,000 in the hole.  I pay off the minimum every month, and a bit more, but last year I still payed about $1,500 in fees to the company at a 15.24% interest rate.  

Back when I was on top of things I was regularly investing into a Roth IRA and a Mutual Fund.  I haven't invested into either of those in the past year or two, as I've been trying to focus on paying down the credit card instead.  I've got about $29,000 in the Vanguard Roth IRA, and about $30,000 in the Mutual Fund.  Should I sell off shares from one or the other to pay off the credit card debt in full, or do the taxes on gains make that a bad idea?  

A few other things that may impact on the decision:  My wife and I will be looking to buy a house probably in the coming year, so I do want to improve my credit score as we will be looking to take out a home loan.  Also, my wife does have an inheritance coming of around $70,000 (minus whatever taxes there are) probably sometime in the next few months?  We would use most of that on a down payment on a house, but should we just wait and use that income to pay off this card?

The question that seems to be confusing everyone is whether either of us, or both, or neither one can claim Head of Household status when we file our federal income taxes this year. 

The advice so far is, ""Neither, because it is 50/50 shared custody.""  Another says in this situation ""whichever parents Gross income is higher can claim it"". And yet another says ""whoever had the kids even one more night that year than the other gets to claim it.""

820,Looking for a tax filing recommendation(s),"Every year since I've been married (this will be tax year #13), I've done our taxes using H&R Block's deluxe + state, filing as ""married filing jointly"". For whatever it's worth, we have 2 kids. Either the first or second year we were married (no kids at that point in time), we actually had to pay a couple hundred dollars in federal taxes, before I adjusted the amount taken out of my paycheck (I don't remember how I did this, but someone in HR walked me through it; my spouse and I both have our same respective employers as we did 13 years ago, so we've never really touched any of that stuff). Since that correction, we've gotten pretty decent refunds every year, particularly since kid #2 was born a few years ago.

In my mind the main reason I chose the H&R Block software was because, for the first several years we were married, our itemized deduction would usually exceed the standard deduction, or at least was worth checking. But since the Trump tax cuts bumped the standard deduction pretty significantly, we haven't come close to the standard amount. I've ignored the IRS Free File option because our AGI the past few years exceeds the amount, but it literally just occurred to me that, since both my spouse and I each make less than the current AGI ($72,000, I believe), wouldn't it be in our best interest to go the ""married filing separately"" route and use IRS Free File? Is there any disadvantage to filing separately that is gained by filing jointly?

Additional facts that may impact any recommendations:
- Both have HSAs, plus spouse has Daycare SA
- Both contributing to retirement plans through employer (spouse is a public school teacher, so it's not a regular ol' 401k plan they have)
- Low 5 figures in a joint savings account, but we don't make any massive contributions, so interest earned is relatively minimal (especially with interest rates plummeting as they did most of the past year).
- No other significant investment income.
- Again, we do make charitable contributions, but our itemized deductions almost certainly unlikely to exceed standard amount
- Again, 2 kids, both live at home

To restate my questions:
1) Go with IRS Free File + Married filing separately? Or stick with H&R Block deluxe + state I've been using all these years (that automatically imports a bunch of my info saved from last year) / some other software recommended in the megathread (TaxAct, Tax Slayer & FreeTaxUSA all seem like attractive alternatives to the TurboTax/HRB racket)?
2) Obviously I can look into changing my withholding amount if I'd like to increase my take-home pay and decrease our refund. Any other simple tricks I'm missing?

Looking for the best way to go about it mostly just need opinions and direction.,"My cat had an accident and now needs surgery pushing between $1500-$2500 USD. I am unemployed directly because of Covid-19 and receive minimum UI Benefits. My gf currently works a job for $14/h and between us we have maybe $1200 in savings.

Our cat broke his femur? on his back right leg up and part way to the socket in his hip. The hip and joint apparently have blockage and for him to walk he needs to have surgery. The Vet suggested taking him within the next few days for surgery and knew of places that could take him quickly. I believe he may very much need the surgery asap to prevent any chance of permanent damage as because he can be very stubborn and I worry he is going to try and walk/play on it even while in a crate.

The only place accepting a payment plan said their earliest may be Feb 2nd, 7 days from now or Feb 3rd, but realistically that is way too long of a time period for me to feel comfortable.

My question is, do I max out our cards and see what I can do to get more credit cards? My credit is about 700. Or would it be better to take out a personal loan through the bank?

How can I best go about my finances?

We do not plan to have children and our animals are our lives. Can anyone help?

EDIT: I made the post more specific. I realized it sounded more life or death and I wanted to let people know that he would technically be ok without the surgery, but would never walk or run the same again. To me he is my life so I was in a panic at the first time writing.

834,How to pay NO interest on a Credit Card?,"Hey All,

Thanks for taking the time to read. I'm sorry if this is obvious.. I tend to over think things, and want to make sure I'm saving myself as much money as possible. Hopefully this can help someone else out there too!

So easily put, how do you pay no interest on a credit card? And I understand its as simple as ""pay in full every month"". But here is what I mean..

Lets use some hypothetical numbers and dates. Say I charge 1k dollars on my credit card with a a closing date of January 20th. I now owe 1k dollars on my due date of February 15th. 

Here's where I get confused..

In order to pay no interest, do I need to pay off that 1k on January 20th so that my February 15th bill shows no balance? Or do I just need to pay that 1k on February 15th, and I'm just overthinking this?

836,Should I sell my car?,"I have been conflicted as to whether or not I should sell my car. About a year ago my parents got me a car (2013 Honda Civic) because I was gonna get my license the next month. We already have a spare car at home (1999 Toyota) but they gave me some money for this car as a gift. Each parent gave me one thousand dollars but I paid for majority of the car. This purchase left me with only two thousand dollars in my savings account. Fast forward to when I got my license. My parents did not allow me to drive by myself and claimed that I needed to have an adult with me and whenever I needed to go somewhere. They basically treated my license like a permit which was really frustrating. We have been going back and forth for the past year about the car and when I can drive. They basically said that I can drive when I’m 18 which is in a year. I told them that if this was their thought process then I didn’t need a new car and could’ve just driven the older spare car that we have instead. So I’m wondering if I should sell my car and get some of the money back and possibly put it towards my dream car or keep it for when I turn 18 and go off to college? 

TLDR: My parents won’t let me drive by myself till I’m 18. Should I sell my car or wait till I can drive it by myself?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5pf74/should_i_sell_my_car/,1611700040.0,1,1,0
837,Should I sell my ESPP stocks for home buying down payment?,"Hey all,

I live in Washington and work in tech company, since pandemic started we had to WFH and I think it's going to be same. Me and my wife both work and we have twins (almost 2 years) and it's really getting hard to focus on work and take care of these two. We currently own a small home and are thinking about moving to bigger home. 

But the home market right now is really bad and there are not enough homes on market and usually the available ones sell for under a week and with $100-200K more than asking price.

The issue we are facing is that we don't have enough cash right now for new home down payment, our options are basically rent a place, sell this home and then start looking for new place, or sell our ESPP stocks to have a down payment for new home and after selling this home invest that money again. 

I am not an expert with stocks, I know there is short term and long term gains but since we buy these with every paycheck I was wondering what is the best approach if we decide to sell these?  Is there a way to figure out how much we might end up paying in taxes? Is it even a good decision?

Also if you have a better solution other than these two, I'd love to hear.

While we're very smart with our finances and live within our means, I don't totally know the best way of looking into refinancing. I know interest rates are low and we've been smart over the last 12 months by putting 20% down on the home to avoid PMI, make slightly larger payments to knock the loan down quicker, and have used some of our stimulus checks towards knocking out  straight principal payments (~$3,500 in extra principal payments since last April). We don't have any monthly debt besides our mortgage payment.

840,"[MA] Buying house with parents, Advice understanding options with 1F/2F homes in HCOL area.","Hi all, 27 and looking for advice with my situation. Sorry if this is a long post, I know how serious home buying can be and want to do it right. Didn't quite find a relevant thread to my situation either, apologies if there is one.

I am about a year out from buying a house. I live in a HCOL area [MA] and renting a 2B apt. with my parents, looking to buy a 1F with an in-law or a 2F option. From my understanding I can claim my parents' rental income with a 2F but the market for 2F homes is tough in my area and the 1F in-law option seems more affordable. Is there any way to claim my parents income without them cosigning? i doubt I'll get approved with just my income.

Numbers:

- $100k income ( + $90k parents' income), about $5,500/mo net income.
- $0 Debt, high creditkarma score (I know this may be lower using FICO)
- Average home cost: $550k-$625k
- I will have 15%-20% down payment, depending on home price. About 90k saved now, will have around $110k by year's end. Parents are willing to provide $10k to closing costs if needed. I understand I may have to pay PMI for 2-3 years (or upfront) and that the market is still questionable for the next year so hard to say what inventory/home cost will be. 

To address living/buying with my parents, we have a great relationship but just need separated space. My gf (will be married next year) is 100% onboard with this situation and has a great relationship with my parents as well. The main reason in not just moving out is to help set my parents up for financial success in retirement (immigrants with little retirement saved) and allow them to move to a LCOL area in 10+ years to retire by renting cheaply from me and but also to set me up for rental income in the near-ish future.

TLDR:
Monthly income will not be a concern given our combined income, its more the closing costs and getting mortgage approval for the loan. Realistically, I get a 2F home, allowing me to claim rental income and set me up for rental options down the line and just deal with the 2-3 years of PMI as I can't afford 20% down for a 2F. Just don't know if there's a better option.

843,Is my investment property plan too risky?,"I am currently living in a rental property for $1.3k a month, but I'm considering buying instead.

The only homes I like on the market are around $875,000. It's a popular city with many big companies. My idea is to buy a home with 3 bedrooms and rent out two of them for about $1k each while I live in the last bedroom.

Loan status w/ Navy Federal:

* 5% down, with no mortgage insurance needed
* 3.65 interest rate ==> $3.8k monthly payment for 30 years fixed

Financial Stats:

* 100k per year post-tax ==> I take home about 8300 each month.
* I have about 65k in my savings.
* No debt
* 750+ FICO

I was thinking that if I have a $3.8k monthly payment, with $2k/month in rent income, then my out-of-pocket would only be $1.8k monthly, which is easily do-able. And if I have trouble finding tenants, then I can still bare $3.8k/month for a year or so while living frugally.

I feel like I've exhausted every resource and am still immensely confused. 

I file taxes as a single person. I made over 140k last year. I lost my job on 1/5/21. 

I forgot to create a backdoor Roth IRA for FY2020. 

**FY 2021:** I maxed out my Roth IRA for 2021 since I am confident I will make less than **FY 2020:** No Roth yet 

**Amount in VOYA Roth 401k**: $1,093.83  


I created a Fidelity 401K to roll over my VOYA 401k, however, they told me I need to create a Roth IRA at Fidelity to rollover my Roth401k. 

The rep at Fidelity said I could also max out my backdoor Roth IRA and rollover my VOYA IRA into that because ""rollovers don't count as contributions."" 

He said that my backdoor Roth IRA for 2020 could be $6000 + $1093.83. 

That does not sound right. 

**TL;DR:** where can I move my VOYA Roth 401K if I am only eligible for a backdoor Roth IRA in 2020, and maxed out my Roth IRA for 2021?

Looking for some advice on my situation:

I currently have two full time jobs.  One job I have had for 3 years and the other I just started.  I will be getting married later this year and my fiancé does not work (and will most likely not work again to raise kids).  Total income with both jobs will be around $280k annual.


My question:
What should (if any) my additional withholdings be for both job? I filled out my W-4s both as single and 0 allowances.

Since I am getting married this year, I will be changing my W-4s to married filing jointly are there any considerations on withholdings?



I’ve verified with both companies regarding HR restrictions, working hours, etc... So I’m not looking for:

Ethical discussion on working 2 full time jobs
Discussion on burnout and how long 2 jobs can be maintained.

I am a 21 year old trying to set myself up for good credit and need some advice regarding credit cards and credit scores.

Info:  I currently have a capital one card unsecured with a $500 limit, I've had it/ made on time payments for the past 10 months.  Unfortunately, my score (707) hasn't really gone up or down over the past 10 months. I've lost 8 points by having my balance increase by $50, and I've lost 5 points another time for having my balance increase by $50 as well. 

I would like some opinions on whether I should get a second credit card. Would this increase my credit limit, effectively making it easier to keep a low credit usage? Or is the credit usage scored on a card by card level?  

Also, is there a golden credit usage percent you would recommend? I've heard if you're to low it wont help and obviously if your too high it won't help. Is there a golden spot that will maximize my credit cards' positive impact on my score?

870,Best Strategy for Renewing Rental Unit Mortgage,"**Background:** Canada, large metro city, unit has been occupied all but 2 months in the past 10 years. Currently tenanted at $1525/month.

Current 5 year fixed (2.49%, 30 year) mortgage up for renewal in September 2021. Remaining mortgage is \~$175,000. Market value \~$400,000. 

I expect to be able to get a 5 year fixed rate around 2%, and my gut instinct is to continue down to a 25 year amortization. However, with rates so low, is it smarter to renew at the lowest rate possible for another 30 year term, and use the increased cash flow to either invest or help pay down my primary residence mortgage? 

While it may feel counter-intuitive not to pay down the debt, I'm also realizing that the mortgage interest is tax deductible and the cash flow generated will probably have a higher return in the market (or the less return but more emotionally satisfying option of further paying down our primary residence).

Is there a standard golden rule I should be following here? Am I foolish to even consider the 25 year term to continue paying down the mortgage principle faster?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5mype/best_strategy_for_renewing_rental_unit_mortgage/,1611693286.0,1,1,0

882,$5k bank error in my favor,"Last Friday, I accidentally double dipped my savings account, and scheduled two ACH payments for $5k each (I could only afford one transaction). Both transactions have **posted**, but only one transaction has withdrawn the funds from my bank account. Neither transaction is ""Pending"", I meant ""Posted."" Thus the issue is that I received a $5k credit on my credit card balance - which has posted, thus the funds are available to me - even though I haven't supplied the funds. My bank account has an NSF Fee from the failed transaction, but the Credit Card has received the funds. Both sides should be able to see what took place. I shouldn't have the funds. 

Logically, I expect this will resolve on its own in 3-5 business days and my credit card balance will go back down, business as usual. 

Except the funds have **posted**, and from what I can tell the ACH transfer should have failed at the gate; and debiting back ACH funds that have posted is heavily regulated/restricted and I'm not sure they can just do that.

My wife (23F) and I (28M) have finally started talking about our future financial plans in a serious way. I have implemented a budget for us both with the intention to buy our first house next year and pay that off in 5 years. We live in Tucson, AZ. 

New Home budget next year: 250k with $0 down and 15yr fixed. Roughly $2k a month in rent. (VA Loan)

Personal Budget below: *Projected for after home purchase next year. 
• Expenses include mortgage payment and maxed out Roth IRA’s each.
• “Target NET” is more or less my way of accounting for spillage, if you will lol. 

*using Take home pay

Me 
Income - $4200mo
Expenses - $2300mo
Monthly NET - $1900
Annual NET- $22800

TARGET annual NET - $20k


Her
Income - $3600
Expenses - $2000
Monthly NET - $1600
Annual NET - $19200

TARGET annual NET - $15k


My goal is to throw almost all of our annual NET (6mo emergency fund is fully funded already) at the mortgage. Theoretically we could be really close after 4 years with only interest remaining but 5 years seems safe. 

Am I missing anything? I’ve heard the argument that it is suboptimal to pay off a mortgage early. I’ll concede that is probably true but I’m looking for more security. We’ll pay much of the 2k We were paying in the mortgage towards retirement afterward. 

The remaining 10 years of the plan include funding retirement more and also saving for a bigger home paid for in cash after selling our first home.

Don't get me wrong, I am all about supporting them the the extent that they will never go hungry, homeless, and will be able to enjoy life within reason (like buy them a plane ticket somewhere every once in a while for example).

I really don't like this notion that I am ready to throw money at whatever they want and they can essentially live off me.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you so much everyone for your thoughtful responses. I'm reading each one to get different perspectives. From your feedback I've compiled a few things to plan out the future:

* I made the mistake of disclosing my income now, and have been a little generous lately. I won't do this again and will rather establish that there should not be an expectation from me. The wording I liked from a post was ""do not include me in your financial planning"". My plan to fix this is to say there is a budget I am making to help out in the family (shared across all family members, so if anyone abuses, it hurts the rest of the family). I will NOT disclose this budget, so they won't know how much I have to give, just as if it were my salary.
* I DO want to fast-track my parents' retirements, and I will use my contributions as leverage to get them to retire sooner (1 hour/week of work less each month month I help out with bills for example). But no lavish things that they would not plan to get on their own.
* I need to learn to say no. My siblings are especially not owed anything as they are able-bodied adults. I may/will still treat them every once in a while, but there will not be a recurring cashout just because. I think I plan to have this talk with them the first time they start reaching into my pockets. (I wouldn't feel comfortable just saying this out of nowhere as if I'm accusing them.)
* While my total compensation is a high figure, I should use this to my advantage to pay of debt and invest in retirement and any other investments beneficial to my future. That said, my true spending power is much further from the dollar figure, and thus I have an even better reason not to hand out cash left and right.

890,Considering New Job Opportunity with 'Write your own ticket' Compensation,"Hi All,

I currently have a comfortable job in management of a $4.5b fintech company.  I was approached by an acquaintance who is the founder and CEO of a local small business.  He's developed a product in this industry (real estate) that is unique and has been a catalyst for growth, and is now looking for leadership to facilitate that growth.  I believe in his vision and that there are good opportunities for significant growth.

&#x200B;

I have not been in the market for a new career, but this proposition is intriguing.  I currently earn about $180k/year where $120k is salary and $60k is RSU stock grants.  He has verbally offered a $100k salary, with a $100k/year target bonus based on revenue growth.  The structure of that bonus is a monthly comparison of revenue growth to the revenue growth in the same month of the prior year.  For example, if revenue grew 5% in February 2020, and 6% in 2021, for a growth uptick of 20% for the month comparatively, the bonus check for the month would be 100k/12\*1.2 = $10,000.

&#x200B;

I'm not familiar with comp plans of this type. While I do believe the business will grow, being penalized for growth that is slightly slower than the prior year seems excessively punitive, especially considering the growth of the overall RE market in 2020.  I have the opportunity at this point to counter his offer, which needs to have a significant portion of the comp plan based on performance of the company as a whole.

893,Looking to finally move my parents into a house - What are my options?,"A bit about me: Illinois, Male, 22, graduated with my Bachelor's in Computer Science May 2020 and started working as a full-time software developer since June 2020. Just received my first raise putting my salary to 60K before taxes. I was fortunate enough to graduate without any student loans/debt to my name, my main expenses are only food and rent which both add up to \~$600/month. Because of the pandemic, I haven't left my house in months which I guess might be a good thing since I haven't been spending..

In terms of where my money has been going, I opened up a 401K with my employer, they match 4% to my 5% and allow 1% increase in contributions for every year I stay. After deductions I budget 20% of my paycheck to a savings account and also have around 10K invested in the stock market.

My dad and I have been renovating our condo for the past few months so that we can sell (\~$100K) and move into a new house as mortgage loan rates have been pretty low. We want to stay within the neighborhood so they can keep the commute short and have been looking at houses within the $250K-$350K range with property taxes about $6K-$10K. We are already in the process with a real estate agent and a loan officer who assisted with my pre-approval letter (approved for up to $390K I believe). To keep things in the future simple, my parents and I have agreed to buy the house under my name although they still want to contribute towards the purchase. My parents are pushing for an initial $100K down payment and as much research as I've been doing, I'm still a bit lost in this whole process. I've read about FHA and I think I qualify but my parents are allergic to debt and would prefer I take a shorter term loan. I've also been slightly intimidated hearing rumors of another housing market crash but don't really follow property values much. I would appreciate any advice on what my options are and what the best route would be to take (for both me and my family)

For a bit of context, my family immigrated to the States back in 2004 and money was always an issue growing up so it means a lot that I can finally do this for them and I want to make sure I do it right. Also might be worth mentioning that I currently do not live with my family.

I'll likely do my taxes on TurboTax this year since I'll have to itemize (sold some stocks for a minor loss, savings account interest, etc).  My wife and I are currently expecting our first child in April.  She is a teacher so she'll be working until her spring break and then taking maternity leave after that.  I'm assuming if I update my W4 today (Jan 26) it will only make changes moving forward and have no affect on my 2020 tax return correct?

&#x200B;

So I'm basically looking for the ELI5 version of updating my W4 correctly.  Here are some questions I had and some of the questions I was being asked when updating my W4 through my company's Workday site.

* Should we file Married Filing Jointly or Married Filing Separately?  She will only be working for about 3.5 months this year.  She does not plan on returning back to work in fall 2021.
* ""Do you work more than one job or does your spouse work?""  - Yes
* ""Will you and your spouse's income be less than $400,000?""  - Yes
* ""Do you want to claim any dependents?"" - since our baby wont be born until April, should I mark yes for this one?  Or do I need to wait until the baby is actually born?
* ""Any other tax credits you want to claim?"" - Not sure how to answer this one, what would this be referring to?
* ""Want to make any other adjustments?""
   * ""Have other income that you expect this year that you want to withhold for? If yes, how much?""
   * ""Do you expect to have total deductions above the standard deduction amount that you want to be considered? If yes, use the worksheet (IRS Form W-4 page 3, Step 4(b)) and enter your result.""
   * ""Want to withhold an additional amount each pay period? If yes, how much?  If you work more than one job or your filing together with a working spouse, you can use the Multiple Jobs Worksheet (IRS Form W-4 page 3, Step 2(b)) to help calculate the amount.""

&#x200B;

Should I leave those last 2 bullet points and subpoints blank for now, and then add adjustments when filing my taxes?  Also, should my wife be making any changes to her W4 as well?

898,Recently moved from a managed portfolio to managing by myself for my Roth IRA. Help ease my mind on market timing.,"Hi folks, recently I (25M) made the decision to move away from a portfolio managed by a financial advisor to managing it myself, which leaves me in a bit of a predicament. In my Roth IRA (the account in question) I have ~$23k sitting in cash, and another ~18k I’d like to reallocate to different funds from where they sit currently. This is most of my net worth, and at least 2/3rds of my current retirement savings. I’m confident that my investment plan is sound, in that I’m going to invest in 3 index funds: total market fund, international market fund, and bond market fund, with varying percentages changing as I get closer to retirement and a “set it and forget it” strategy. I plan to not touch the money until I’m at least 60. My question is more about the timing of this initial investment seeming less than ideal with the markets doing so well. I’m afraid that by putting this lump sum in all at the same time right now, I’ll be starting at a disadvantage for the rest of my investment lifetime. Now I know, “time in the market > timing the market”, but I still can’t help but be nervous to pull the trigger.
I see two options:
1. Invest it all right now and stop worrying about it
2. Slowly put 1/12 of the total in over the course of 2021
Or some hybrid of the two.
Can anyone ease me one way or the other here?

Thanks!

901,Negative credit impact from late payments on co-signed mortgage - any solutions?,"Hi, new here. Would appreciate any suggestions with my current situation. 

**Background:** A few years ago I co-signed a mortgage for my brother's house as his income alone couldn't qualify him for the loan. Our parents couldn't co-sign as they were not Greencard holders at the time. The idea was that the parents would step in if my brother falls short on payments. 

Everything's been going fine for a few years but last year, my brother lost his job and missed three payments. I was not aware as he didn't tell me and all the correspondence from the lender was going to him, not to me. This obviously had big hit on my credit report. I otherwise have a solid credit history (not a single negative remark) and had score of 795 before this happened. 

He has since made up the missed payments, the rest of the payments on time, sold the house and now the loan is off my credit report. However, the late payments remain. My credit score nosedived to 650 last year but is now back up to 735. 

**Now the question:** I'm about to purchase a house and will need to apply for mortgages. My understanding is most lenders won't even consider an application with that many recent late payments regardless of what the credit score is. Is there any way around this? Is this something I can explain to the bank and they can use their discretion? 

FYI, I will be jointly applying with my wife who has clean credit with 790 score. In terms of income, we are more than qualified (we both work for large, well known companies and monthly payments will only be 30% of our combined after-tax income) and we are both completely debt-free (other than some monthly credit card balances that we always pay off every month). My income is about 40% higher than my wife's. 

I'm ok with paying slightly higher rate given that the rates are already super low, but I'm afraid of not getting approved at all. We are looking to put down 20%. Also, the size of mortgage we will be looking for is Jumbo, which might make this a tougher battle. 

I wanted to get some expert's opinion before I actually apply to see what happens as I don't want to apply too many times and further comprise my credit if this will be a long shot.

Flash foward to January 2020, I signed up for credit karma to check my  credit for the first time and I first realized this case of fraud  against me.

907,4% rule on stocks vs using RE Rental income for retirement,"\*\*EDIT\*\*: I am not here to be talked into all the reasons owning RE is terrible and tedious. I am coming from a place of likely choosing RE as my investment of choice beforehand but having second thoughts on even bothering with it as my retirement vehicle of choice given decent returns in the past 5 years' bull market. I understand that and am coming from a place of experience with and acceptance of the downsides that are presented even with (never truly passive) property management. As someone whose business model will likely revolve around owning commercial real estate (a different discussion), and will likely have real estate as my vehicle of choice, I am interested into diving deeper into the mathematical reasoning and the risks of choosing either method, or a mix of both. 

&#x200B;

My short question is, **why settle for the 4% rule if 6 or 7 or 8% cash on cash returns in real estate is a possibility (\*edit if you are someone willing to deal with the ""headaches"" of non-self managed properties)?** and **Does anyone have experience with ""Coasting"" FI?** I have spent the past few years ""learning"" about real estate investing while not having the time/money to dive on in just yet (just youtube and a few years' experience working as a realtor before medical school) and I have a feeling that real estate could give us the same retirement income with less capital invested, as we could in theory only need $17X or $18X invested by retirement, not the $25X traditionally needed for 4% rule, with X being our yearly expenses. This is the end of the important details part of my question and I am more than happy to hear responses solely based on this part.

Our net worth is $X completely in stocks/mutual funds/etc and we've been investing about \~20% of our take home pay during residency (I have one year left and she has two), and this math is assuming 7% growth 3% inflation and the 4% rule.

I went to fund my account to buy some stock and it’s wanting me to allocate it to a year, and showing max contribution amounts (6k).... all normal for my target fund but I feel like stocks should be a different.... if you throw 6k into a stock in this scenario and lose it, have you killed your contribution limit?

Sorry if this is super newbie. I have read a lot of the sidebar info here. Account is with Vanguard.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5k15u/new_roth_ira_and_stocksdid_i_do_it_wrong/,1611685424.0,1,1,0
917,Lost everything and need advice,"In mid 2019, I was doing great. My credit was at a 780, I was working 2 Jobs and going to school. I was 27 and really proud that I got my credit up by myself. My car payments were really high (due to high apr and no co-signer) but I made it work. I also started off with a secure credit card and then got my limit up to $3,000 due to me making payments on time and before due dates. I was engaged to my ex fiancé who paid our rent. I paid the electricity, household items, and did groceries. My goal was to get us a townhouse or condo after I graduated. I had excellent credit and was excited for us both. Things go left, found out he was having a baby with someone else. Long story short I ended up about having to leave the apartment and I couldn’t afford somewhere alone so I had to leave the state and stay with family. I ended up losing my car and voluntarily repossessing it, ($7000) and maxing out my credit card ($3000). By the end of 2019 I moved back to the state I was in on my own, found a job and got an apartment. Even though my credit dropped to 400 and I was living check to check I was proud to do it  without any help. Now when Covid hits I lose my job. In Summer 2020 I have another mental breakdown and have yet another debt ($2000). In November I got evicted because I couldn’t make the rent. I lost everything in the apartment as well. They sent me to collections for $9000 for the apartment. Now I’m back up north bouncing around from friends and family’s house. I found a job here and I Just paid off my credit card. I have the medical Bill of 2,000 car 7,000 and apartment 9000 looking at a total of $18,000. I want to settle them so I can save up and move back down south to finish my degree.

918,Taxes on joint account with a parent?,"Last year my father passed away from Covid. It was a hard time and my mom was especially worried about the finances since she always let my dad handle all of it. She was getting overly anxious about making sure all the bills were paid and how to handle the money. She begged me to be added to at least some of her bank accounts and I relented. I'm now a joint owner on a savings and checking account with her. Her SS and Pensions are going into a separate checking account. 

With tax season starting, I just realized that I may now have to pay taxes on these accounts and was hoping that someone here could help me figure out how this works for non-married joint owners?  The child-parent joint account info seems to mostly be for young kids/college accounts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5jzyn/taxes_on_joint_account_with_a_parent/,1611685331.0,1,1,0
919,"Special situation, makes sense to buyout car lease?","I am coming to the end of my 4 year lease that cost $457 a month. INB4 all comments saying it was a bad decision, I know, I was a young dumb 19 year old. 

Anyways. I was fortunate enough that $300 of that lease was paid by my mom (not as a cosigner they just transferred me cash), while I took on the remaining $150. So after the 4 years, I personally have paid $7500. The lease buyout price is $22k. I now make $70k a year, and can take on that loan no problem, I have no other debts.

Does it make sense to buy the car, given that I personally will pay effectively ~30k TOTAL for a car that was valued 37k when it was new and I started driving it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5jz06/special_situation_makes_sense_to_buyout_car_lease/,1611685256.0,1,1,0
920,Need assistance with our W4s - We owe $3K this year :(,"Clearly something is off.  Running the numbers through TurboTax this year, we will be owing $3100.  We've never owed this much before.  Each have 1 job, Married Filing Jointly, no dependents, standard deduction.

My earnings from my last paycheck is $2937.60, Fed withholding $196.40 - paid every 2 weeks  
My wife's earning from her last paycheck is $5043.70, Fed withholding $262.47 - paid once a month

I have $29.00 additional withholding per paycheck and she had $67 a pay check additional taxes (we did that to minimize how much we'd owe at the end, if we owe).

Reviewing my W4, it says Married Filing Jointly.  There's a check box for 'Multiple Jobs or Spouse works'.  This is UNCHECKED.  Clearly an error.  Does this box checked off mean it will withhold more or less taxes?  Waiting for my wife's W4 to see if the same box is unchecked.  Needing to know if this is the key of the issue.

Can someone review my situation to confirm if I'm correct in assuming not enough taxes came out and tell me how to fix my W4 so I don't owe anything at the end of the year?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5jxap/need_assistance_with_our_w4s_we_owe_3k_this_year/,1611685119.0,0,0,0
921,Roth IRA Excess Contribution/Backdoor Roth Question,"This year I think I'll be above the Roth IRA AGI income limits for the first time. Previously I'd been contributing monthly to a Roth IRA and had automatic investments setup. Unfortunately forgot to turn them off and I had one of the investments go through this month. 

Looking at the IRS' website, it looks like there's a 6% penalty per year it remains in the IRA. It's only been a couple weeks so I'm not near that point yet.

Is the appropriate course of action to just withdraw the money? If so what happens at tax time next year with respect to any capital gains/losses associated with it?

Also if I take the money out, could I still contribute the full $6000 (2021 limit) to a traditional IRA, then immediately convert the $6000 in the traditional IRA into a Roth IRA (backdoor Roth)? 

Currently I only have a Roth IRA, and then traditional/roth 401k balances, so if my understanding is correct I wouldn't have to worry about the pro-rata rule.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l5jwy1/roth_ira_excess_contributionbackdoor_roth_question/,1611685094.0,1,1,0
922,Should we rent forever?,"My wife and I currently make $230K a year in SF, we have no kids and aren’t planning on having any. We’re currently putting $88.5k a year in retirement accounts including employer contributions. I’m utilizing a mega back door Roth so I can put away $57k a year in my 401k and then we max out my wife’s 401k and both our IRAs.

923,"Closing on first mortgage, will my credit card balance be an issue?","Greetings! I’m exactly 1 week from the closing date on my first mortgage for a condo unit. As it stands, I’ve been issued a conditional approval from my lender (Navy Federal Credit Union) for an amount of $271,000. 

My anxiety as I move closer to closing is being fueled by reading some of the horror stories of buyers being denied at closing due to lenders discovering new lines of credit, undisclosed debts, losing their job, etc. 

My situation is as follows:

My lender determined my current combined assets at $109,000. Over the last few weeks, I’ve been making purchases for the condo. I have two credit cards: 

1) an Amex gold charge card (does not have a set credit limit)

2) an Amex cash magnet credit card (has a $22,000 limit)

The majority of purchases for the condo I’ve made on my gold card. As it stands this morning, my balance was listed at $1,617. I paid $617 from a savings account and have the balance at an even $1,000. When I get paid this Friday, I’ll pay an additional $566 to this amount and get the balance down to $434. I won’t be charging any more purchases to this card until after the closing. 

My cash magnet card is the card I use for most of my everyday purchases ( I buy everything on my credit cards and pay off my entire balance weekly usually). I made a purchase of furniture from Wayfair on this card this Saturday at a combined amount of $2,390 (I made the purchase on this card due to a referral bonus I had on the card and I would receive a large amount of points.) I made the transaction on Saturday; the next day (Sunday) when the transaction was posted to my account, I paid it off in full (a housewarming gift from my parents haha). As it stands, the only balance I have on this card is $400 of my standard weekly purchases (grocery, food, gas, etc.) which I will pay around 90% off this week as I do weekly. 

As it stands:

- Closing is in 1 week

- On Friday, I will have a balance of $434 on my Amex charge card (which has no limit) and a balance of less than $100 on my Amex credit card (which has a limit of $22,000). 

- I have made large purchases on these cards in the last few weeks, but have paid them almost completely in full. In addition, the charge card does not have a credit utilization factor. 

Besides the concern of the credit cards, I have no additional loans, the property has been appraised as was expected, and my employment is secured. I have also not applied for or opened any new lines of credit or taken out any loans since beginning this home buying process. 

With all of these things considered, do you think my loan is in any danger of being jeopardized? When the lender pulls my credit prior to closing, will they just pull my credit score and report or will they pull up the actual balances on each credit card?

I appreciate any and all feedback, I will add any updates to my scenario to help you if you need them!

Some quick stats:

Current credit score: 787 as of 01/26/2021

Length of credit: 7 1/2 years

Current Lines of credit: 2 credit cards and 1 charge card

No outstanding personal or student loans, medical bills, child support, etc.

I would obviously love a free service/website. But as much as I hate the fact that service like Turbo Tax ans their lobbyists are the main reason they can keep taxes confusing and charge for services, I’m honestly happy to pay for it, if it can help me do my taxes simply, and error free.
