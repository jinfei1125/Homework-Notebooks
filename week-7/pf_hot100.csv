Last March, we posted a [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fhrfqo/coronavirus_megathread_resources_discussion_and/) with tons of information about Coronavirus-related issues, and in September a [second megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) was posted with additional information on updates to payroll tax deferrals, student loan interest waiver, and unemployment. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic and recent U.S. governmental actions, we are posting a third installment of this megathread. **Please keep in mind that politics and political discussions are still not allowed here.**

# Stimulus Payments (updated Feb 13, 2021)

If you have not received the first or second stimulus payments at this point and believe you are eligible, or are eligible for more than you have already received based on your 2020 tax return, you will have to file your 2020 tax return and claim the missing amount as the [Recovery Rebate Credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit). Common cases where this applies:

*I believe I was eligible for the first and second stimulus but haven't received it, and still get an error when checking the Get My Payment portal

* I was a dependent in 2019 (and/or 2018 if your 2019 was not yet filed for the first stimulus), or mistakenly indicated that I could be claimed as a dependent, but cannot be claimed as a dependent for 2020 (Note: You don't just decide if you're a dependent or not, verify if you are eligible to be claimed as one [as defined by the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p501#en_US_2019_publink1000196863).)

* I had a child in 2020 and am now eligible for the additional amount for a qualifying dependent

You can check if you are eligible with the [IRS eligibility FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-a-eip-eligibility). Non-dependent individuals were eligible for $1200 for the first stimulus and $600 for the second stimulus if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) was below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 for the first stimulus and $1,200 for the second stimulus if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 for the first stimulus and $600 for the second stimulus per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

If your AGI is above the cutoff amounts noted above, your stimulus payment will be reduced by 5% of the difference between your AGI and the income threshold. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000 for the first stimulus and $87,000 for the second stimulus. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000 for the first stimulus and $174,000 for the second stimulus.

**The recovery rebate credit is determined based on the information on your 2020 tax return**, you can see the amount you’re being credited directly on your Form 1040, Line 30 of your prepared return before you file. Any of the online tax services can handle this tax credit. If you have questions about which tax software to use, there is a [Tax Filing Software Megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/kz613i/tax_filing_software_megathread_a_comprehensive/) with more information.

Some people have reported getting the second stimulus payment later than expected, so it’s recommended to double check the status of your stimulus payments on the [Get My Payment portal](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) before filing your tax return. 

### **FAQs:**

* **Q** I filed my 2020 tax return already to claim the second stimulus payment I hadn’t yet received, then received a check in the mail for the missing amount. What do I do?

* **A**  You'll likely have to wait until your return is processed, and then file an amended return, to correct this issue.

* **Q** I don’t file tax returns because I earn below the reporting threshold or don’t have any income. How do I get the recovery rebate credit?

* **A**  You can file a tax return without income. Include any income you do have, even if it is below the reporting threshold, even income from a savings account can be included. Otherwise you may need to add in $1 in interest income in order for the online tax services to be able to handle processing the return. This is essentially what the Non-Filer’s Tool that was open last year did for you.

* **Q** I am eligible for both the first and second and stimulus based on my 2018 and/or 2019 tax return, but will not be eligible based on my 2020 tax return. If I never received it, is there anything I can do to get the recovery rebate credit?

* **A** No, the recovery rebate credit is ultimately a 2020 tax credit. The information provided on your 2020 tax return is what is being used to determine your eligibility, your previous return information does not matter at this point.

* **Q** I am eligible for both the first and second and stimulus based on my 2018 and/or 2019 tax return, but will not be eligible based on my 2020 tax return. Will I need to pay back what I received?

* **A** No, there was no information provided in the bills requiring payments to be returned if eligibility changes between the 2018/2019 and 2020 tax years. This is also noted in the [IRS FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-j-reconciling-on-your-2020-tax-return).

* **Q** The [Get My Payment](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) portal says the payment was already sent and/or I received Notice 1444 in the mail saying my stimulus was sent, however I never actually received it. What do I do?

* **A** See the IRS page on [Payment Issued but Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Not Received](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-f-payment-issued-but-lost-stolen-destroyed-or-not-received) for guidance on starting a Payment Trace

The IRS has an extensive list of [Economic Impact Payment FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center) with more information.

Be aware of potential scams related to stimulus payments or other coronavirus relief packages. CNBC has a helpful article with examples of [common stimulus scams](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/29/stimulus-check-scams-here-are-red-flags-to-watch-for.html).

At this time, [a third stimulus has been proposed](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602024/second-stimulus-check-update-senate-kills-2000-payments), but has not been officially passed. If that changes we will update this information to reflect that. **Until then, there is no additional information to provide regarding the criteria for a potential third stimulus or how the payments may or may not be handled.**

# Payroll Tax Deferral

Payroll taxes consist of two related taxes: Social Security (6.2% of wages) and Medicare (1.45% of wages). Both employees and employers pay these taxes (i.e., for every $1 of social security taxes you pay, your employer also pays $1). Only the Social Security portion of payroll taxes may be deferred right now, not Medicare.

The Secretary of the Treasury has been [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/) to defer the collection of Social Security taxes on those making a gross income of less than $104,000 / year ($4,000 or less per bi-weekly paycheck) starting September 1.

Implementing seems to be optional by employers and many employers have decided to not implement this.

The IRS had issued Notice 2020-65 indicating that taxes deferred must be withheld and paid between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021, or interest and penalties will start accruing on May 1, 2021. **The window to payback the deferred taxes has been extended under the new stimulus bill to December 31, 2021. Deferred taxes must be paid by January 1, 2022 or interest and penalties will start accruing.** 

See the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for FAQs regarding the payroll tax deferral 

# Coronavirus-Related Distributions from Retirement Plans

Penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts for Coronavirus-Related Distributions ended December 30, 2020. If you made one of these withdrawals during 2020, remember that you have three years to pay the income taxes on the withdrawal. The IRS has an article with [Coronavirus-related relief for retirement plans and IRAs questions and answers](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/coronavirus-related-relief-for-retirement-plans-and-iras-questions-and-answers) with more information.

# Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Rollover

FSA account balances typically do not rollover year-to-year. The second stimulus package allows for FSA balances at the end of 2020 to be rolled over and used in 2021. Any FSA balance remaining at the end of 2021 may also be rolled over and used in 2022.

# Unemployment Benefits

Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) provides benefits to individuals typically not eligible for unemployment insurance, such as independent contractors or gig workers. Under the CARES Act these benefits were set to expire Dec 31, 2020. It has now been extended to March 14, 2021. Please visit your state’s PUA website for more information.

The previous unemployment relief of $300/week from the federal government and $100/week from the state expires Dec 26, 2020 (see the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for more information and FAQs regarding [this executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/) from August). **Under this new bill, federal unemployment will provide an additional $300/week through March 14, 2021, and the maximum number of weeks that unemployment can be claimed has been increased from 39 weeks to 50 weeks.**

**If you lost your job or are at risk of losing your job:**

Please read the information available in the [Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)

If you have any questions regarding those resources, feel free to ask here, but please be as specific as possible with your current situation and what steps you have taken so far.

# Student Loan Interest and Payment Waiver (updated Feb 13, 2021)

The CARES Act suspended federally-held student loan payments and interest charges until September 30, 2020. The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/) signed in August extended this to December 31, 2020. The December bill extended this date to January 31, 2021. At the [end of January](https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/f), the deferment was extended until Sept 30, 2021. 

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Most mortgage owners eligible for reduced or suspended payments for up to 12 months under the CARES Act 

Key points:

1. The CARES Act covers about [70% of all mortgages](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=406472) in the U.S. (those backed by Fannie and Freddie, FHA, VA, or USDA). Many companies have similar policies for most other types of loans. If you aren't sure what kind of loan you have, ask your servicer.

2. In most cases, you will [not owe the missed payments as lump sum](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/after-you-receive-relief/#repay). There was a lot of confusion about this. The new guidance says that lump sums are not required for [GSE](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Announces-Payment-Deferral-as-New-Repayment-Option-for-Homeowners-in-COVID-19-Forbearance-Plans.aspx) and [federal loans](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/SFH/documents/IACOVID19FBFactSheetConsumer.pdf).

3. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

4. Requesting mortgage relief/deferral will appear on your credit reports and may affect your eligibility for refinancing (but doesn't affect your actual credit score).

5. For more info, the CFPB published [step-by-step information](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/housing) about how to request payment relief.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs. 

Effective Dec 1, 2020, refinancing mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will incur a 0.5% [adverse mortgage fee](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/refinancing-a-mortgage-will-cost-more-thanks-to-an-adverse-market-fee.html). 

# Relief for Renters (updated Feb 13, 2021)

The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/) signed in August required certain federal agencies to take steps to limit foreclosures or evictions. It did not include a list of specific actions or policies. 

Following this in September, the CDC ordered [Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions To Prevent the Further Spread of COVID-19](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/04/2020-19654/temporary-halt-in-residential-evictions-to-prevent-the-further-spread-of-covid-19) that expires December 31, 2020. This has since been extended to March 31, 2021.

Read [Protection for Renters](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/) from the CFPB and visit the [NLIHC page for COVID-19 Rental Assistance programs](https://nlihc.org/rental-assistance) for additional information and resources

5,Made the mistake of going with a debt settlement company. Where do I go from here?,"I started a debt settlement program 3/27/20 thinking I was going to better my credit card debt situation but I was completely wrong. After a year into the program and realizing it was a mistake, I'm trying to see what you guys would do in my situation.

Prior to enrolling, I had racked up around $15k in credit card debt between 5 creditors and felt like I was drowning. I was able to make minimum payments on time every month but it felt like I was throwing my money away and that the card balances would just never drop. I signed up for a debt settlement program, one where they essentially let your accounts go delinquent while you make payments into an escrow account that the company uses when they reach a ""settlement"" with your creditor. This has cost me a ton in extra fees and a major drop/damage to my credit score. Granted, I am the one to blame for not doing my research prior to getting into this.

The program as of today has reached settlements on 3/5 accounts (1 paid off/closed and 2 being paid off with structured monthly payments from the escrow account). The other 2 have higher balances and a settlement has still not been reached. I checked on [annualcreditreport.com](https://annualcreditreport.com) and saw that 4/5 of the cards were charged off and unable to be removed until February/March 2027.

I realize a lot of the damage is already done and probably can only be fixed with time, but is there anything I can do as damage control to possibly better my situation? I see people mentioning different things such as contacting creditors or collection agencies directly, or sending pay for delete letters.

I appreciate any insight you guys have so thank you in advance. Let me know if there is any other information you guys may need.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lsplyq/made_the_mistake_of_going_with_a_debt_settlement/,1614312810.0,15,15,0
6,Rejected mortgage due to size,"Hi,

I’m in the process of obtaining a mortgage through private sale, from a Big 5 bank in ON, Canada. 

Had a few hurdles along the road, but now I believe I’ve hit a wall. It’s my grandparents home on 3/4 acres lot, with 600sqft single family residential building, detached garage apprx 500sqft, couple small sheds in the back. 

I just heard back that the bank cannot do financing because of the square footage of the house. Has anyone heard of this? I’m not finding anything online related. 

It’s an older home (50yr+). Not a modular or “tiny” home. 2br, 1 bath kitchen/dining and separate living room. 

I know it’s small, but I’m confused as to why they couldn’t do lending for this place? My grandparents lived there for 45 years, and I’m currently living there. House is in fair shape, just a bit outdated.

I also do freelance work on the side and get payed much more per client as it is 100% mine, but clients are more sporratic and they pay more. BUT I don't have time because I spend too much time at the photo studio and when I come home I'm too tired to work on bigger projects.
Me and my mom have found a lot of people in the modeling/photography/videography industry and I have a LOT of opportunities I can pursue but I spend too much time at my job.
I have the confidence to be one of those instagram photographers/videographers that make a lot of money because I know I can create the same quality as them.

I already have all the equipment I need to charge people big bucks.

9,Fear of having to work until I’m dead,"I’m 32 years old and have about $20,000 in all my retirement accounts combined. Right now I’m saving 3% of my salary and my employer contributes a little under 3% matching (something like 2.5 or so). 

I make $72,000 a year (just got a raise!) from $65,000 previously. My wife makes around $64,000 a year and hasn’t been contributing much to her 401k recently because we’ve had some large expenses recently, but she has about $20,000 saved up too. She’s a contractor and doesn’t have 401k matching. 

I’m so stressed about saving enough for retirement. I don’t want to work until I’m 70 or even 65 really, but will if I have to. 

Right now I also cannot afford to contribute much more than 3% to my retirement. I was stupid and have credit card debt that I’m trying to pay off as fast as possible. 

After that, I will be paying the amount I put towards the credit card towards retirement so about $600 a month. But that still seems like not enough. 

Anyone else stressed out about retirement? How can I make sure that I’m financially secure?

I read about people contributing 10-15% of their salary and I just don’t think that I can do that (at least currently). What are your plans like?

Currently have 40K in my 401K, I believe my company matches up to 7%. 

However, I just opened a Roth IRA that I will be contributing to monthly towards Target date funds, and ETF’s. Wish I would have done this sooner. My question is, should I continue to exceed the company match contribution to my 401K, or notch it down just to get the percentage match limit and put the rest into my Roth? 

New to all this, but from what Ive researched I should get a more efficient return in a Roth IRA, right?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lsm9jq/should_i_exceed_my_companies_401k_match_or_just/,1614302335.0,12,12,0

14,Can you use two health insurance plans for pregnancy to save in any way?,"[California, US]

We found out a bit ago that wife is pregnant. She currently has health insurance through her company. I have mine through my company, but my enrollment period is open right now so I was wondering if it made sense at all to add her so he has two insurance since there will probably be a lot of expenses during this year.

That being said she is also highly likely to leave her current job this year (possibly before due date) and switch to a new company. There might not be a lot of choice here, since we moved states and she's just working remote for her old company temporarily. If that did happen we obviously don't want her uninsured for however long until her new insurance kicks in too. So we are leaning towards adding her regardless to mine.

My current payments are ~80/mo and with adding her it goes up to ~3xx/mo. So definitely not cheap, but it also seems like when comparing our two plans that my deductibles/copays are a lot better than hers, so maybe it even makes sense to have her leave her companies plan and we just use mine (that is if there is no benefit to having two).

And anyone have any good resources on preparing financially for pregnancy (not long-term, more like FSA/HSA stuff)?

20,Buying more expensive home - good idea or foolish?,"Hello everyone,

I will be working with our financial planners but also curious for your experience/advice.  I'll try to keep it brief/general.  My wife and I currently own a home worth about 800K.  We owe about 325K left on the mortgage with 17 years left to go.  We both have pretty good retirement savings and about $250K combined in investments, and some (but probably not enough) in a college savings plan.  We have one 10 year old child.  We both earn low to mid six figures.  She has about 10 years until retirement with a nice pension and I will probably work a bit longer than that.  We live in an area with a high cost of living, we don't live lavishly at all but we have all we need plus money for entertainment, gifts, dining out, modest vacation, toys, etc.  No other debts besides one car lease payment.  

In a perfect world, we would like to buy a more expensive home to get some features that we don't have in our current one (namely a larger backyard with a pool and our own driveway and parking).  I estimate the new home we would wind up with would cost 1 million.  We don't plan to retire here, and when my wife retires we plan to move to a less expensive area.

So we vacillate.  One week we say, it's foolish to move, let's stay where we are until retirement.  If we have any extra money let's save it, invest it, try to pay off our home earlier etc.  These are definitely uncertain times.  Right now our jobs both feel secure (especially hers as a city employee), but you never know.  I was laid off from a previous job several years ago but luckily had severance and found a new one before it ran out.  Finding work should not usually be an issue for me but hey you never know, especially if the pandemic god forbid drags on.  

The following week we think, why the heck not?  We can afford the monthly payments, especially if we take out a new 30 year loan with hopefully a lower rate (we are at 4.375% now) and maybe eat out a bit less.  We only have one life to live and we can really enjoy these new features while our son is young.  We've got a little nest egg in the investments just in case something unexpected happens.  And besides, won't this ultimately be an investment, and the home's value will only appreciate over time?

So....what do you think?  What would you do?

21,Can I afford this?,"Hi.. advice needed please. My partner and I are splitting up - I have the option to sell the house we live in, or keep it. I’m nervous I’ll be stretching my budget too thin but I know it’s a great investment (beautiful renovated house in a beautiful and expanding neighborhood). After all of my bills are paid, insurance, car, utilities and the mortgage is paid, I will have around $1500 a month left for food, savings (and retirement), gas, dog and cat food and leisure and any home maintenance. This is only if I don’t make additional commission that month. I try to structure everything off my base pay and not my commission because it’s not guaranteed. My commission is based on year over year numbers and I had a good sales year in 2020. So, naturally, I may be able to expect my commissions to be lower this year and rise again in 2022 (In theory). Included in the $1700 mortgage is $200 of PMI since we did an FHA loan. I can anticipate refinancing and having this dropped sometime in 2022, or perhaps 2023 which would give me an additional $200 of wiggle room. So I guess my question is.. is $1500 enough left over to take care of the things listed above (again this is IF I make no commission) This is my first house and I’m scared. Please don’t judge..

22,Mom wants me to Cosign for a new house since my dad passed away,"Hey all,

So I am kind of lost right now so here I am! Here is my (29f) situation. I am married, already cosigned with my husband on our current house, have student loans, car payments, and looking to sell and move to a new house before our first child is born. I'm due in July 2021. Overall, I have over $300k to my name and I only make 35k a year. Husband makes $102k. We live in MD.

My mom (69) currently lives in a house in SC but wants to move to a new house in SC.  They want to keep the old house to rent for additional income. My brother(28) lives with her and he is making around 30k. Mom doesn't work but she getting survivors benefits and Social Security. When my dad was still alive in January 2021 he and my mom were about to buy the house but now that he passed away in February it cuts their finances down and now the lender wants either a cosigner or mom has to put down $101k for the down payment on the new house. Even if they do sell the old house they won't make enough to cover the down payment.

Mom says that my brother can't cosign because he he single and doesn't make a lot of money and it's better if I cosign since I am married. I do not want to cosign because I am worried about how this will effect my credit and when me and my husband  go to buy our next house.  I tell my mom my concerns but she won't listen and then turns on the water works and says ""you want us to live in an apartment!""

IDK guys. I feel bad about my mom but I'm worried about my future. Would I even be approved with my mom and brother? What happens if I do cosign? What are the options for my mom of I don't cosign?

26,Totaled car that I still owe and only liability insurance,"I financed my car with Toyota on December 2019. I was told I needed full coverage insurance and to sign up with Geico and I could change it later. It was too expensive for me so I put it on my parents insurance in January 2020 because it was cheaper. 
I told the insurance agent to remove our old car and to put my new car. I was not clear and did not say to put full coverage so the agent put whatever coverage the old car had which was just liability. The whole year I had it I just assumed I had full coverage and never read the statements we got in the mail. 

I got into an accident that was my fault and my car is totaled. The insurance is only covering the other car but not mine. The gap insurance is still processing the claim but if they do approve it they’re only covering around $2,000 which still leaves me with $18,000. I’ve been told by multiple shops that it’s not worth fixing. 

I don’t want to mess up my credit by not paying it and I was told I can’t sell it because it has a lien on it.

What should we do?","Hello everyone, first time home buyer in Texas and we are looking forward to hear your wise advice/suggestions. Hopefully the questions aren’t too stupid, we are still learning everyday about this process. Thank you! 

We locked our rate on Feb 4th with an interest rate of 2.5, no point no fee for a single family home. Today, when we get our final closing disclosure, rate is still 2.5 but with point and a fee of $1775. The reason was even though the house is a sfh, on title and legal documents it is identified as condominium or detached condo. We asked our lender in writing right from the moment we knew it was listed as condominium if this would effect our interest rate. He said no because in reality it is a sfh. But now, turned out it is effecting us. 

He then offer us a 2.625% interest rate and $700 credit which we could put towards closing cost. We are thinking about negotiating the fee with lender, maybe 50:50, has anyone done this with their lender before? No one said negotiating is prohibited so we were just thinking why not? Or should we go with his offer for 2.6% and a $700 credit. Number wise, the 2.5% makes sense in the long time but we have to put down more money at closing. The 2.6% sounds good right now at closing because we would pay less. But in the long term, we technically pay more for interest rate. How would you decide which situation is better for you?

I’m thinking my best option is to stay with fidelity and use their Rollover IRA option? It is a traditional 401k, so that means I would have to do a traditional IRA I believe. 

My new company uses Vanguard and automatically enrolls everyone to contribute 6%. But they do not match. I have not been with the company long, and so far have only made 2 contributions to Vanguard through payroll.

From what I understand, my contributions to the Rollover IRA would not be tax deductible since I was enrolled in the Vanguard account through my employer? Would it be better to just stop contributing to the Vanguard account since there is no matching anyway? Or would it not matter this year since I already contributed to it.

40,"Canadian Small Business owner, what to invest","I am from Quebec, Canada. Please be kind as this is my first post. I do not have a lot of education or experience in investing. I was an independent contractor doing manual labor for many years and have my own small business corporation. There was only me inside it. This was so they don't have to pay for my benefits and also for liability. I was ok with this arrangement, I was young and the extra dollars/hour helped. 

I always took out just enough for what I needed. However recently I got injured and am no longer to continue the same line of work. I got a desk job that is full time and it pays enough for my expenses. I have a sum of money left in my corporation \~120k, that I cannot take out or I'll be taxed heavily since I am getting income from my regular job. My accountant says I should invest it instead.

I spoke to a bank financial specialist. I was given some options such as long term savings account that pays only 1%. Mutual funds, bonds etc. Then he also mentioned I could maybe use my corporation to invest in stocks or properties. 

1) I was wondering if I can use my corporation that was in one business (labor) to do another (stocks, investment, property rental?). I have been trying to figure out if my corporation is a ""S corporation"" but for some reason I can't get a straight answer. If my corporation isn't a ""S corporation"" that can trade stocks, is it hard to convert it into one? Should I take the time to learn how to invest by myself with Apps like SimpleWealth or hire a broker to handle it?

2) After talking to family and friends, they told me it is a bad time to jump into stocks. I should look into property however from  my own research, I think cannot justify buying a property for my small business if that corporation is no longer generating income/has no activity? So my option is to turn it into a rental? How would that work and is that a good idea? 

Greatly appreciate any feedback and advice on how I can invest the money left in my small business corporation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lss5t4/canadian_small_business_owner_what_to_invest/,1614322848.0,1,1,0
41,Debating on whether or not I should try a personal loan,"I've made quite a few bad mistakes in my life, but I've gotten the underlying issue of reckless spending under control. I'm 25, make about $32,000/yr and owe $10k in C.C Debt, 21k in car debt. Wondering if getting a loan from upstart could make sense for me.  Need opinions and advice please. Here's the breakdown.

Card 1 - $5400 balance | 18.99% APR | $143/mo min payment

Card 2 - $3970 balance | 14.24% APR | $88/mo min payment

Card 3 - $842 balance | 14.99% APR | $40/mo min payment

Car Loan - $21,000 balance | 8.99 APR(I know) | $439/mo

Yes, I know the car is stupid and I've already lost sleep over it and admitted it's a huge problem. Already looking ahead at the future and how I can fix this, not at how I got here because I've solved the root issue.

So, I bring in about $1950 a month and my expenses right now, after everything total $1450. I have $500 extra to throw at the cards. That's not enough for me, I'm trying to create some extra wiggle room here. I plugged in some numbers at Upstart, and it looks like I could get a few loans. Wondering if any make any sense to y'all, or if I shouldn't bother in the first place.

Loan 1 | $12,000 | 3 Year | $405.17/mo | 17.97% APR

Loan 2 | $12,000 | 5 Year | $282.44/mo | 17.17% APR

Loan 3 | $15,000 | 3 Year | $511.64/mo | 18.61% APR

Loan 4 | $15,000 | 5 Year | $359.86/mo | 18.50% APR

So, I have a few thoughts here. I'm currently upside down on my car loan by about $3,500 if I were to sell the car right now. If I take the $12,000 or $15,000, I could take the difference and get rid of this POS, and buy a cheap Honda Civic or Prius for say, 5-6k. I'd have around 2-6k left to then throw down at my cards. So, if I do that, I'll eliminate the $439/mo payment at the least and knock out a huge chunk of Card 2. I plan to have Card 3 paid off within the next month as well. Really, I think I'm just trying to get rid of this car because I am tired of paying so much for it. I know the three year loans are about what I pay for the vehicle now, but I'd be freeing up a few extra hundred dollars a month as well as shedding off some of my total debt. I guess I just want to know if this is a stupid idea or if this could help me out.

42,How much buffer money should I leave in my checking account for monthly expenses?,"So I finally hit my 6 month emergency fund goal and saved up $25k in a savings account. My question now is how much additional money should I keep in my checking account for all of my monthly expenses? I would like to start allocating my savings now towards retirement investments, but I don't want to end up having to move money from my savings account over to my checking account to pay  any bills because I didn't leave enough leftover. I average monthly expenses around $4k per month (VHCOL), so generally I keep about $6k in my checking account at any given time. 

My income is also pretty variable so it makes it hard to have a strict $0 budget which I've seen recommended. Some months I may only have $4k come in, but others I might have $12k come in.

43,Currently in process of a Mortgage,"Hey everyone, currently in process of getting a mortgage for a house, the house is priced at 300,000$. I applied for financing through 4 different banking lenders to compare prices, all are close to same rates, it’s an FHA loan I am pursuing mainly for a 3% down payment and having about 25,000 saved currently. I decided to purchase this home because it is a 3-unit home with spacious units, calculated rent with “vacancy” of 6.5%; with myself living there I am estimating costs to be about 100$/month in costs after average electricity, oil, and taxes all included in total mortgage. 

This being said, the bank mentioned my Debt-to-Income ratio is currently 47% and they would need to see 45% or I will need to go to underwriting (which I’m not entirely sure how this works, I thought all mortgages went through underwriting) but the bank I discussed with mentioned I should sell both of my current vehicles (I have loans on them both: 28,500$ and one for 13,000$) I only have my second loan to have a secured debt rather than credit card debts from hardship in the past. 

What I’m looking for information on is, 
What is underwriting? 
Should I be concerned about the 2% over? 
If I cannot sell my vehicles in a short period of time (I currently have them listed for owed amount; about the value of/a little less than what they’re worth in the market) would I likely be denied?
And genuinely your thoughts overall. 

This is my second home purchase, my first was 6 years ago when I was 20 years old. I have never missed a payment in my life, no negative marks on credit, and a credit score in the 720 range. 
I sold my home in September to get out of the city due to crime rate raising and because my homes value was quite reasonable compared to what I paid.

44,Mom Passed - could use some helpful advice as to best handle her affairs,"My mom recently passed and did not leave a will. My sister and I will be handling her affairs.  My sis is on two of my mom's bank accounts (the two that we know of right now) so we so currently have access to funds to help pay for funeral preparations and other expenses.  Someone from the bank told my sis that because she's on the account, the bank wouldn't freeze the account until lawyers get involved. Is this true? Our goal is to involve lawyers as late in the process so that we don't run into issues with paying some of her bills.  Any other steps we should be taking to make the handling of her estate as smooth as possible. In the state of Louisiana.

Mom still has a very small mortgage on her house and a small car loan. Both which could be covered by monies in her savings. Do we have to pay this off first in order to take possession? Or can we just roll the mortgage and loan into our new ownership? Should we try to negotiate any remaining medical bills? Do we continue to make good faith payments on home utilities and car note until we work out all the financial issues?  Or is there a better way to handle this? Is there a way to get a complete history of financial info for our mom to make sure she doesn't have additional bank accounts, or life insurance policies, IRAs, etc?  How do we find out if any of mom's insurances/policies would pay off her debt at death? 

We've heard that there may be advantages of putting mom's property and monies into a trust of some sort. Does that sound reasonable and possible? Are there tax advantages of doing this? I'm currently dealing with some financial issues of my own (trying to avoid bankruptcy) and do not want to jeopardize any of my mom's assets that could be left to me and my sister just because my name will be on it. Would a trust protect them from a future bankruptcy on my part? Should I just forfeit my claim to anything and not even have my name associated with the trust?

46,Unemployment taxes from 2020?,"Hi, everyone! I'm not sure if this is a question for PF or r/taxes, honestly, but I thought I'd start here since it seems to still fall into the category. 

I can't seem to remember whether or not I had taxes withheld for me from my unemployment, or if I chose to do it myself? Is there a place on my unemployment site that I can see what I chose? Apparently idk what terms to use in order to find this info on google, cuz it keeps pulling up stuff about withholding it yourself. But, I can SWEAR that I remember the ability to have them withhold it for you. I'm in Wisconsin, if that makes any difference. 

So, long story that probably doesn't even matter ahead; read at your own risk.

I applied for my benefits pretty late, spent a very hazy week and a half on the phone with them daily for 5+ hours, and jumping thru hoops. (I don't like to think about it, because it was grueling and traumatic, lbvs) I had a really weird case, and I was consistently having to either call other departments, or sit thru being bumped up tier-by-tier to the top. Basically, in the end, I got the number for a dept that did all of my application via phone, including all of the past weekly claims. I did the entireity of my app online prior, but can't remember if I had already been denied when I did it via phone call. 

Anyway. Got denied for the first benefit year they established, and tbh, I kind of just gave up. Someone gave me a call a few months later and I had been w/ my son, so I asked if I could call back. She said yes, but if I didn't, they were going to make whatever decision they needed for me. Of course, I spaced and did not call.

Fast forward to the second stimulus. I check my bank account and have 6K more than I expected. It all came thru at once in mid December, but I never got any notification saying it came in, so I wasn't even aware. 

I just started renting my first place with my son, and I'm to figure out what my finances are gonna look like over the next few months. I don't do my own taxes, and they're being done late this year due to some missing w2s, otherwise I'd ask them. I have enough stashed away to pay the 10% but, of course, I'd PREFER to use that money for other things. Like a bed, since I live on an air mattress. 🙄

I started my home search about a year ago. At that point in time, I was pre-approved for a $300k mortgage. I was employed (and had a side gig), making around $120k a year ($100k salary job, $20k side gig). A few months ago, I quit this full time job to focus on my side gig. Based on the last 3 months of income through self employment, I should make as much as last year if not more. However, based on some recent googling, it's looking like its much harder to get a mortgage if self-employed, especially without 2 years of history. 

Anyone here have some insight on implication of this recent career move? Anything I should look out for when shopping for a mortgage? 

Also, this is purely an investment property and I already have renters (family) lined up that will cover mortgage + approx $1,000/month profit - will this information help in getting a mortgage?

61,"Should I sell truck to pay off high interest credit card debt? Raise my credit, then finance another truck?","Hi all, this is my first post here but I would appreciate some feedback. Currently, I have about 14k of credit card debt and an 8k personal loan, so about 20k debt total. All due to unfortunate family issues (I am actually very smart with my money) Both are costing me about $750+ every month, yet I am getting killed by interest, and feel like I am barely making a dent. I am unable to allocate more in my monthly budget to help offset the debt. It's also hurting my credit score (currently around 635) because of my 95+% utilization 

However, I have a newer truck that I have completely paid off. KBB value is around 32-35k. My plan is to sell the truck, get the 32-35k and pay off all of my 20k debt completely. Then, I will have around 12k-15k left from the sale. Then, I would use this as a large down payment on another similar truck to the one I sold. After receiving loan quotes, it looks like I could get something similar for around $500 -$550/ month. Overall, this would 1. lower my monthly payments 2. wipe out high interest debt, 3.raise my credit score, and 4.  the monthly bill would be put into an asset (even though it's one that's deteriorating) rather than all that money going to high interest debt. To me, it seems like a win win. 

I have a few questions/ issues though. First off, I would like to have a similarly nice truck. I make decent money, and I am required to have a nice, reliable truck for work. I also drive many high profile clients around on a weekly basis so I would like to have something similar to what I have now.

Secondly, I wouldn't want to try to qualify for the loan with my current credit score. I would want to wait until I have wiped my total debt to 0, which once it reflects, would raise my score well above $725+ (aka lower interest and more flexibility). However, I will still need a truck in the meantime. I'm wondering how long will it take to reflect on my credit once I completely pay off all of my debt? Secondly, the idea now is to rent a truck in the meantime until that credit change reflects (hopefully only a month or so). I'm not sure, but something still seems a little risky selling my vehicle and banking on waiting for a credit score update because obviously it's not viable to rent a truck on a monthly basis for long.

63,Lost Credit Card Dispute,"Hi everyone,  first time PF poster, here. I did check the wiki and searched previous posts, but didn't feel like any of the scenarios matched mine closely enough, so here I am!

I recently opened a dispute with my Chase credit card. In early February,  I received a notification from Chase that a $5000+ charge had been made to my credit card to Amazon Web Services. (I get automatic emails over a certain dollar amount.) I do not have an account with AWS, have never done business with them, am not an IT professional, etc.

As soon as I saw the email, I contacted Chase. This was less than half an hour after the time stamp of the email. They advised me that I couldn't dispute the charge until it posted. In the meantime, I asked for a new card and attempted to contact AWS. FYI, AWS is super HARD to get ahold of; they even say somewhere on their site that they don't have a published phone number. I filled out an online form for the sales department,  but never heard back. I called ""normal"" Amazon to no avail; they couldn't help. I also filed a police report to cover myself further and created a timeline of every step I took which I emailed to myself so I would have a date and time stamped version of what I did.

Fast forward a couple of days, the charge posts, and I contact Chase to dispute it. I mention everything that I had done, including that I had filed a police report, but they said they didn't need a copy. They remove the charge from my account, send me an email confirmation,  etc.

Today, I received a letter in my account inbox that I would be responsible for the charges because I ""received benefit from the charge."" That's it, no further info on HOW I benefitted, which I didn't because I didn't do any business with AWS. I tried to call Chase Fraud, but they were closed by the time I called. My husband did some digging and found another online form for AWS to use if you have an account issue. So, I sent them a huge wall of text about my issue. I haven't heard back because it's after business hours, etc.

So, what is my next step? Continue to pursue with Chase? Wait for AWS? File complaint with FTC? Send tweets/post messages on Facebook to one or more of the above companies? Get a lawyer? I have some free time tomorrow and am open to suggestions! Any help would be appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lsn7ev/lost_credit_card_dispute/,1614305348.0,2,2,0

69,Landlord charging me over $2K in repairs and also entering my apartment without asking (CA),"I live in SF and have been paying rent on time for 2 years for my in-law unit ($1900/mo). I gave my notice to move out and my landlord is being very nit picky about everything in my apartment. 

She made me do an initial walk through and listed out a bunch of stuff I needed to do:

- professional cleaning
- steam cleaning carpet 
- change light bulbs on ceiling 
- get yard cleaned 

She has $2700 in deposit and so far I’ve already paid $700 for the backyard weed pulling and for the door to be fixed out of pocket. Now she is asking for $1K for me to replace the carpet because she doesn’t think steam cleaning will be enough, she says she is going to take this out of the deposit.

OK. I agreed to all of this. I begin moving things out last weekend but still had some stuff and valuables at my place. The day I move my bed out the landlords son (who also lives in the house) was in my room and using the back yard. Without telling me. Today, 2/25, I come back to start moving more things out and they have a bunch of gardeners moving things and cutting palm trees without ever giving me notice. My bf and I were planning on working there while packing and my bfs meeting went really bad because there was a bunch of background noise. 

I just feel like they haven’t been very nice or gracious towards me and now this was the final straw. 

I let them know besides being inconsiderate, it’s illegal for them to enter while I’m still paying rent and before the walk through. And they didn’t even tell me! If they had told me I wouldn’t have planned to take a meeting from there.

Masters admissions season is happening now and I’m trying to decide where to go from a money and ROI perspective.

I got lucky and got a job out of over 800 applicants, but I never want to go through that process again if I can avoid it. I want something that is in more demand. 

I’ve got into some programs for a new field that is very related: UX & Human-Computer Interaction. 

Should I go to the brand name schools? ~$60-80k but they have great industry connections and the students land great tech jobs making between 125-160k. These “name brand” schools sometimes have co-ops with large companies as well. 

OR... 

Should I attend a state school (still a good program) that is under $20k for 2 years and can be done remotely so I can keep my job. My job also offered to help pay for part of it. In this case, they offered to pay for the whole thing. The program is online, but they’d been doing distance learning long before Covid. It’s an established school and a land grant university. They don’t hand-hold you as much for getting a job, but they also have some career fairs and some good connections from what I can tell.

89,Should I pursue a new role at a different company?,"I moved from an MCOL area to an HCOL area. Unfortunately, I underestimated how much it costs to live in the Seattle area. I started this job about 4 months ago. I cannot say they are treating me badly as they have given me a 2.24% raise from the performance period of October through December. Pay raises seem to average 3% to 6% anually. I also receive a bonus of 5% of my pay and a COL lump sum of 2% a year.

I make 148K a year and have no debt other than a 700K mortgage which I am sure you can understand takes up 42% of my income which is causing me to feel the pinch. I am however still able to maximize my 401K and both my wife's and I Roth IRA. Additionally, I am able to put about $400 a month into a brokerage account. We have a full 6 months of living expenses. Our children are young so my wife is a stay-at-home mother for the next few years.

Would you all agree with this approach?

Is seeking a job 4 months after starting a large well-known company a bad idea?

For a better background, I was employed at my last company for 6 years while holding different positions so my resume doesn't indicate I am a habitual jumper.

I love the company I work for now and the work I am doing is exciting. The company has run into hard times over the past few years especially since covid. I kinda feel betrayed they would bring me on to possibly face a layoff a few months later after moving my family halfway across the country at my own expense. However, I know how corporate America is, once you're locked in raises/promotions can be hard to come by. Not saying this is the case here yet. But I made the mistake of waiting around at my last company for promotions/pay to increase exponentially and it never did. I about doubled my salary here but being in an HCOL area it was almost offset.

They key point that I am confused is the following text “Because this is a loan amendment and not a new loan, your annual percentage rate won’t change”

Our interest is going down and our monthly payments is less. The total time left to pay the mortgage doesn’t change. Why wouldn’t our ARP go down? Is there hidden fees or something I am missing?

Side note: I know amendment tend to be for people struggling with payments and can affect credit score. This specific amendment states “this loan amendment  option is not intended for customers who are experiencing financial difficulties.” So I assume it shouldn’t affect our credit score?

Yeah it was on our list of things to do, but never got around to it. Either way, by Dec 31 2020, we both had $0 in those Trad IRA accounts. Come Feb 2021, before filing taxes, we figured we better do the Backdoor process. We both contributed $6000 into our Trad IRA accounts, waited the shortest amount of time possible, then converted both our entire accounts into our Roth IRA (like shown here [https://www.physicianonfire.com/backdoor/](https://www.physicianonfire.com/backdoor/)). 

Now we're trying to file taxes with TurboTax online and I've come to realize that we may have missed the timing on this. We didn't receive a 1099-R from Vanguard. I figured it was because we did it after they send out all their tax forms. I called them up asking about it. The CSR explained that the although you can make Roth IRA contributions up to April 15, the Trad IRA - Roth Conversion is only counted in the calendar year. So essentially, we both made Roth contributions for tax year 2020, but the Trad IRA conversion can only be reported for tax year 2021. Which ultimately means, for tax year filing of 2020, we both made contributions to a Roth IRA that will be subject to penalty due to our MAGI. Does that sound right? Do we just pay the penalty and move on?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lsl5yj/backdoor_roth_ira_after_dec_31_tax_filing/,1614298957.0,2,2,0
94,Can I contribute to a Roth IRA for the year of 2020 if I worked all that year but am currently unemployed now?,"Can't seem to find a detailed answer to this question. I just opened a Roth IRA and want to contribute 12k right now into it - 6k for 2020 and 6k for 2021.

95,Requesting HSA investment suggestions,"My employer just changed HSA providers and I have $13,000 that I need to invest.

96,Getting a Death Certificate for Inheritance,"Hi!

I was wondering if anyone would know how to get a death certificate from a non-relative to receive inheritance money. A close aunt-like friend plans to leave me her savings (and does not want her sister to get the money, family troubles). We do not want to hire an executor because we don't want to lose the money (we have considered adult adoption). Does anyone know a way around this?

97,Do not prepay hospital for delivery of baby,"TLDR: Do not pay the ""Expected out of pocket"" expense estimate the hospital sends you before your child's delivery - other related bills are processed faster and your prepayment isn't factored into your deductible/out-of-pocket until last step of billing process (at which point you've now overpaid).

We followed the rules & paid the expected out of pocket a week in advance because I didn't want my wife being pestered with ""please put a credit card on file"" harassment while delivering our child. Big mistake for one reason - the billing process takes forever and you could end up floating thousands waiting for a refund. Your prepayment is not reflected in your insurance policy until the hospital bills insurance, insurance reviews claim & responds, hospital receives response and issues refund. All the while, smaller claims can be filed from other providers and are processed quickly, and then you're on the hook for the balance of those since insurance still thinks you have deductible/out-of-pocket portion left.

I researched this in advance and didn't see any posts with this side of the story, so here it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lsbr3b/do_not_prepay_hospital_for_delivery_of_baby/,1614273805.0,6,6,0
98,Student loans over the original amount borrowed. Does this heavily impact my credit?,"I'm in the process of rebuilding my credit. I had some rough years of unemployment and I'm trying to make up for them now. I'm currently employed and making around 50-55k per year with 10k in savings. I'll be moving to a new city in May while keeping the same job. Living expenses will remain the same. I have 13 student loans taken out through my academic career all over the original loan amounts by the following amounts:

$**120.79**

$262.9.

$89.39

$121.14

$98.19

$277.35

$196.49

$975.82

$207.69

$1137.93

$100.3

$1303.62

$142.13

My question is, should I pay down these amounts now so that they are below the original amount owed? Or should I keep paying into savings or my acorns account until I get settled into the new city? They are all deferred now due to the covid forbearance and are not accruing interest. If I were to pay these down would this impact my credit greatly? Any information or advice would be very much appreciated. I'm hoping to get my finances in order and make the best moves financially for future financial stability.
