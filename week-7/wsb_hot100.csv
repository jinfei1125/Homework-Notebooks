My father was 57 years old, and had a lot of issues. Nobody really thinks about all the good things until someone is gone. My father wasn't a man of means, but during the early stages of my childhood fought hard to provide us an amazing life. And did so without ever really letting us know. 

After a divorce front my cheating bitch of a mother, after multiple back issues, multiple surgeries, and multiple risks to his day to day life, I think he just went downhill. 

I haven't gotten an official answer from the coroner since he's over 3 states away and it's all being communicated mostly through texts with his girlfriend right now, but honestly I'm not sure I want to. 

I came here to say, my father believed in me with all of his being. When I told him I owned 4 shares of  GameStop and that it was way over priced when I bought it, he just told me how proud he was. Pretty convinced he didn't even know what I was saying. But in that same way he believed in me, he believed in every single one of you too. My father would've loved this cause and would've rallied with us till the end.

I had a cool ass dad and you guys all deserve to have a cool ass dad too. He believed in me, and he believed in you too. Whether you're winners, or losers, or damn dirty apes.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair.

25,PLEASE READ!!!! (GME) WHY THE DIP IS GOOD!!!!,"**Ok look, idiots, I am no genius, but this drop from 170 to 100ish is not all bad.  TL/DR at the bottom for the most autist...**

Here is why- 

1) **We are still up huge from the close of yesterday** and have seen a solid ground at the 106 range. This establishes a floor, i.e. the minimum amount of money the stock can go if paper hands sell.

2) I have read multiple articles claiming **that Short Sellers just on Wednesday lost a total of 818 million.** Why is this important you may ask?? Well simply put for you fellow atuists, with these HF down nearly a billion in one day, they can't continue the squeeze because they have no capital to buy the calls back. **So this might leave us with no large increases until Monday until capital can be raised to cover.** 

3) We know from the past, that without capital **A) there can't be any short latter attacks B) the HF will be forced to pay high interest on these positions if they don't cover them. C) there will be a continuation of a squeeze if we hold.** 

IT won't LET ME POST THE LINK- just look it up it's the first article.

4) **Other shorted stocks have a good chance at rising too.** Rember GME is the big whale while other shorts like AMC, NOK, and BB are more like fishes (still valuable but not like the whale). So while HF gathers capital to cover shorts on GME, **they will have to pay BIG BIG BIG bucks on interest with the other smaller stocks.** 

**TL/DR: don't panic because you see a drop right now, there is a good chance that it is because of limited capital from HF because of Wednesday's crash, leading to no money to cover shorts.** This means HF will be forced to pay interest on the positions they still have and will lead to a bigger squeeze in the next few days. HOLD THE LINE.

26,To Everyone Who Lost Money Today (GME),"(Mods this is my second post, plz don't take it down. People need to know)

You apes have to remember that ""they"" are watching us very carefully. They know our every move. When the stock price exploded yesterday, all you paper-handed autists came back and hopped on the GME train spamming memes and talking about how you're gonna throw your money in at market open because of FOMO. THEY KNEW YOU WERE GONNA DO THAT. These bastards knew. They let you buy at a high price and when they knew they had you, they started selling their shares in masses to drop the price and scare you. They want you to sell tomorrow, do not fall for it!

To all of you who invested at peak today, DO NOT LOSE THE FAITH. There are hundreds of thousands of call options set to expire tomorrow. If you autists don't sell, they will be fucked with their options causing another gamma squeeze (exactly what happened yesterday).

Cmon apes I know we have it in us ü¶çüöÄ(Plz make sure the paper-hands see this)

It is important to note that short volume doesn‚Äôt mean all these shorts are locked in, the shorts could have quickly been covered. However today‚Äôs short volume is a lot higher than the rest of the month, with days usually ranging from 1-10m.

EDIT: Thank you u/RicFlairsCape \- correct about the volume being total volume, not total shorts. i have updated the formula, looking at total short volume executed. Agree we don't know if it is all new positions or not, but the volume increase of acted shorts is in line with what we saw last time.

My fellow apes!

boilerplate: i know nothing, i can't do math good. don't listen to me

I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see a increase in short volume over the last 2 days! [http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html)

(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user friendly document)

There was nearly 12 million in volume yesterday and 33 million in volume today! This is literally IDENTICAL to the volume we say on Jan 21 & 22 (11M & 33M) just before the price jumped.

Here are my data tables, again all taken from the Finra daily data.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4nu7pw2qiqj61.png?width=411&format=png&auto=webp&s=a78510efc699300403664be7020c1d1bde0158ce

There are conflicting reports about the size of the GME float, so I took the more pessimistic 54.5M shares vs 45M, but if you use those numbers, we are looking at \~130% of float is shorted.

Now of course people will say that everyone is shorting GME because the price is skyrocketing and they want to get in on the inevitable fall, and I'm sure some of that is true, but when we had 148m in trade volume today, you can be damn sure that A LOT of this was to try and keep the price from going up.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xoluyyyodqj61.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=6466d0bed1614ebf578a636134a34d3e9f5848f9

&#x200B;

This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 185% shorted and GME as 9% of its portfolio.

[https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)

&#x200B;

Doing some quick math of \~$68M of GME at $91.71 =  743k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.4m GME shares shorted.

TLDR:

THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT  **üíéüôå** üíé will prevail!!!

Stake: 100 shares GME **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

for those interested. more info from Finra about this data:

""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""

Also: **They borrowed 1,500,000** $GME Shares **to short yesterday (**[**https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**, but there was no huge drop off or sell volume that would indicate, that they already shorted those. That means, they are now using those shorts as well as the ETFs.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Millions of shares being sold short today, trying to get people to panic sell. DATA IS FROM 9:45AM.

Edit: Holy shit guys thanks for the support make all of WSB see this

36,Should Keanu Reeves play DFV in the movie about GME?,"This will probably get deleted and I‚Äôll get banished for 3 days, but I was thinking.

Keanu Reeves = DFV

GameStop = John Wick‚Äôs / Keanu Reeves‚Äôs / DFV‚Äôs dog

Robinhood = Main Antagonist

Hedges = all the enemies in DFV‚Äôs way to get to Robinhood 

Basically it‚Äôs John Wick, but Robinhood killed his dog (i.e. GameStop) and he fights off all the hedges to get sweet revenge on Robinhood for destroying his baby and taking away his tendies.

Plus we could slip in some subliminals like a fight scene inside of an AMC movie theater and the phone John Wick uses could be a blackberry or Nokia (Whatever DFV has more shares in probably.)

The ending could lead to what we‚Äôre facing right now. The rebirth of his baby yet all the other stocks are getting destroyed in the process. Could lead to a cool Wallstreet stock market fight scene idk. 

Maybe give Keanu Reeves‚Äôs / DFV diamond hands ‚úãüíé and an ape sidekick ü¶ç. Maybe a fight on the moon üöÄ featuring Elon Musk. Idk were still working on the sequel.

Please let me know what you think.

52,GEE EM EE Short volume is fucking absurd.,"Those fucking Cramer fondling pricks with names like ‚ÄúMelvin‚Äù and ‚ÄúKen‚Äù can‚Äôt fucking help themselves. 

Look at this shit. Finra said SI was 60%. No one cares anymore because we know it‚Äôs a crock of shit and so out of date it has mushrooms growing out it. But why though? Well let me tell you fucking why. 

Look at the short interest from feb 24 and feb 25 on gee em ee. (Don‚Äôt worry theres a picture just below)

These two days alone, if you review the call and put volume, remove it from the total volume, like your a goddam autist god called Dr Burry, and just look at the finra daily short volume by itself:

24th

https://i.imgur.com/LqbFadP.jpg

11m shares sold short. 

25th

https://i.imgur.com/MMb5LUK.jpg

33 fucking million. 

That‚Äôs 45 million in 2 days. That‚Äôs 75%ish of the float(I ain‚Äôt got a fucking calculator). 

This is not including puts and calls.  

The  short volume has been bigger than DFVs diamond space hopper testicles. Considering the huge price drops today there is no way the 33 mill shorts today have been covered.  (Unless you go buy Bloomberg logic where they say buying makes the price drop so maybe this DD is wrong I dunno they have a magic old man terminal with a fancy keyboard with green buttons). 

33m is about half the fucking float on a single day. You think Kenneth Melvin covered that shit? They‚Äôre so balls deep in shorts you‚Äôd think they were fucking midgets. They clearly want to either be right (lol as if) or, go so fucking bankrupt they get a bailout.   And this doesn‚Äôt even cover the ETF nonsense going on.

57,Why Options will make the squeeze go parabolic,"At the the time of writing this it is 2am Est February 25. I'm back with another GME post, if you saw my past ones you probably already know what this is going to look like. If you haven't most of them were deleted when the mod stuff happened, so oh well.

The purpose of this post is exploring options and the effect they will have on GME stock. This will not be exploring lack of liquidity, short interest, or fundamentals. 

I went through every call option chain and manually counted volume. So all the numbers I use will be rough estimates and expect a margin of error. 

To sum up the data there is 65k call options expiring this Friday,that likely will not be relevant unless we see massive price jumps today and early tomorrow.  There is 265 in all the other strikes put together. This is 330k volume in total which is absolutely massive. There is volume 65k concentrated in the 800 strikes. 10k of this is for Friday and the other 55k is all the other expirations.(bear in mind I have not factored in puts volume as well, which will have negative effects)

The two scenarios I will present rest on the fact that the squeeze reaches 850 and delta is roughly 100 making dealers need to hedge 100%. Once it reaches this point shit will start to heat up and price movements will be even more volatile. 

Scenario 1 
Cohen tweets a picture of a rocket ship, price increases 4x in AH and trading tomorrow. This would put price at about 800, dealers become fully hedged and need to have 330 * 1000 * 100 = 33,000,000 million shares by this point. This is more than the entire float. They likely already hold 10mil plus, but in this event they would still need to buy  more 23,000,000 shares. 

Scenario 2
It takes another week for price to rise to the 800 level. All the options from last week expire. This still leaves 265k  means that 26,500,000 still need to be hedged. This event is more likely and has a decent chance of happening has along as we get another catalyst. 

What does this mean for smooth brained retards? Im sure the autist already see where this is going. The simple version is if we reach 800 we will soar right past 1k and trading will become extremely violent. Price targets of 1k are laughable because if we reach 1k we are going right past it. 


Tldr: we break 800 we going to alpha centaria (PT 100K)

60,FORGET ABOUT GME ALREADY...,"Okay so now that I didn‚Äôt use ‚Äúspam‚Äù phrases. And now that Melvin and all the other suit moderators have moved on. I will repost my thoughts for a third time: 

What an absolutely great day everyone. First off, we had a massive rally and then we started to dip. You might ask why? Is it because of paper hands? Well...everyone knows how the previous hug (not a squeeze) took us to $450+ so I doubt it was majorly stimulated by fear because everyone knows there‚Äôs more to be squoze but yeah, there may have been some who couldn‚Äôt hold on. But the biggest factor today was the DOW DJI (A.K.A the index that tracks the entire US market) went down by about 559.85 points (1.75%) and so the whole stock market was bleeding out pretty badly today...and yet through this all GME MANAGED TO GAIN 18% and 2% in the after markets. Do you understand how insane that is!!! Well done you diamond handed space ape rocketeers it means that today there was tremendous buying pressure that it even beat out the entire market force AND the shorters. Hopefully tomorrow, we will see a bounce back from the DOW meaning upwards market pressure. If it does then it‚Äôs basically the same as earths gravity repelling us to the moon rather than keeping us grounded and INDEED we may potential see the MOTHER OF ALL SQUEEZES IN HISTORY. Good luck everyone, F*[% you Melvin. This is all just my opinion and not Financial advice. P.S I like the stock. GME TO THE MOON üöÄüöÄüöÄ

73,CNBC just accidentally reported some bombshell information,"This video has some pretty juicy nuggets of info that deserve its own DD:

&#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls84js/even\_cnbc\_is\_now\_reporting\_that\_melvin\_and\_vlad/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls84js/even_cnbc_is_now_reporting_that_melvin_and_vlad/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

They claim to have inside info that the short position loss for Melvin was as high as $16.8B at one point, before they were bailed out by Citadel.  According to earlier reporting, Melvin ended January with $8B in assets.

&#x200B;

[https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/melvin-capital-reddit-gamestop/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/melvin-capital-reddit-gamestop/index.html)

&#x200B;

Melvin was worth $22.6B in their 13F filing on 12/31 back when the share price was $20.  $22.6B-$16.8B= $5.8B. Add the $2.75B bailout that they received from Citadel, and you wind up with $8.5B in assets at the end of January, which roughly checks out with the CNN reporting. So I believe that CNBC's info is genuine.  They go on to speculate about whether or not Gabe Plotkin effectively now works for Citadel due to the terms of the bailout (or what I like to call Citadelvin now that the two are so intertwined). They're not talking about Vlad working for Citadel, (I think  Cramer was confused, what else is new) so put away your torches and pitchforks, for now...

What's interesting is that they say that the loss has since ""come down from there"", and then they received the bailout to ""keep going"".  Remember when Gabe Plotkin called up CNBC in the wee morning hours and claimed to have covered their positions back when price was in the low hundreds before the first squeeze? Up until that point, that was an ATH, so then how did that loss come down if they had exited GME?  The way I see it either 1 of 2 things happened:

&#x200B;

1. They told the truth about closing their shorts or covering with synthetic longs and then re-initiated a net short position later to try and make some back on the decline of the first squeeze.
2. They were lying about covering their original GME positions at all and that $16.8B loss amount was at the peak of the squeeze and was mitigated as the price came back down.

&#x200B;

If first scenario is true, then it means that Citadelvin decided that it was time to take their medicine and get out when the price was in the hundreds, and then a couple days later decided it was a good idea to try to time the peak of the squeeze perfectly at $400 to reinitiate shorts and make some money back.   Maybe that happened and Citadelvin have since exited when GME came back down to the $40 range, maybe the price action we're seeing now is due to Citadelvin finally exiting their net short position, maybe Citadelvin still has a net short position and are in big doo-doo. No matter what, this info that Melvin has recouped some of their losses suggests that the chances are high that Citadelvin maintained a significant net short position into February and may still have a net short position.

&#x200B;

Edit 2:  I want to take this opportunity to implore everyone to think critically, including about what I've written here.  Sort by controversial to try and get opposing viewpoints.  DD is more powerful when people try to poke holes in it.  That's why DFV posted his thesis on WSB to begin with.  There's somebody in the comments claiming that CNBC reported that Melvin admitted to congress that they still had a net short position. Until there's some evidence to back that up, file it in the disinformation category, even if it further supports your theory.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lser2s/cnbc_just_accidentally_reported_some_bombshell/,1614281519.0,1730,1730,0

Think about it. There‚Äôs only a certain time frame until the ice cream melts and becomes pointless. The ice cream represents us cashing out on GAMESTOP. What happens if we eat the ice cream? We get FAT, motherfuckers. FROM. THE. GAINZZ.

BUT eating the ice cream isn‚Äôt without its problems. What happens if we cash out all our money too early??? What happens if we eat the ice cream too fast??? That‚Äôs right, ladies and gentlemen, and retards.

We get BRAIN FREEZE.

Cohen is warning us the shares for Gamestop will freeze, damn hedge funds will do anything to prevent this from rising, but Cohen is showing support by telling us to be patient. Motherfucker named his company Chewy cos he‚Äôs telling us to chew. **DON‚ÄôT FUCKING SWALLOW IN ONE GO**. Savour every moment, motherfucker.

If you want your money to do more for you, take advantage of the leverage that options bring. Keep buying and holding your shares, but don't forget that calls are what starts the gamma squeeze.

According to MarketChameleon, yesterday calls represented 64.4% of options volume (compared to puts at 35.6%, because some of you can't count to 100), whereas today calls represented only 49.5% of options volume. Big money is trying super hard to keep GME down by buying a ton of puts.

ATM or ITM options make market makers hedge more than OTM options.

93,"If GameStop hits 800 before 2/26 we will trigger the Mother of All Short Squeezes, read up.","Alright, ya fucks, I'm gonna get straight to the point.

*If GameStop hits 800 before 2/26 we will trigger the Mother of All Short Squeezes*

As we learned from the last spike to 483, it was **not** the shorts squeezing. *As Melvin* ***admitted*** *in the Congressional Hearing that they did* ***not*** *cover and the spike was from* ***gamma****.*

If you do not know, this ""gamma squeeze"" occurs because of call options. As the prices surges, Market Makers are forced to write more calls and buy shares before they even become available, surging the price higher. 

So, now because we have fallen all the way back down to $40, we have a catapult cocked down as far as it can go, ready to be launched.

There are *millions, and millions, and* ***millions*** of shares written in those call options all the fucking way up to 800. These shares are not only buried in the 2/26 calls, but also every single date after this as well. ***So many fucking shares.***

If we can get to 800 and *all these calls become* ***in the money*** the Market Makers will have to scramble to buy millions and millions of shares that will surge the price up.

The craziest part is that this does not even take into account the shorts covering. So, as the Mother of All Gamma Squeezes squozes, sending the price into the thousands, the shorts will then also be skyrocketing the price at infinitely higher prices.

If you did not read my last dd [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnvvu3/why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a_collapse_of_the/) about GME short interest being 400%, we learned that u/thabat ran an AI-generated model of GME‚Äôs stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme ***$130k a share.*** 

Now, while I then believed this to be a completely outlandish number, I now believe to have realized that this gamma squeeze that will occur if we hit 800, ***is what it predicted.*** 

*To reiterate:*

*I believe that the AI-Model of GameStop's share price, which predicts $130k a share, is predicting this because it believes that we will hit 800 before 2/26, therefore causing the* ***M****other* ***o****f* ***A****ll* ***G****amma* ***S****queezes. Which will* ***then*** *trigger the infinity short squeeze which sends us to $100k+.* 

Many others are also starting to realize this as well, check out this post on r/stocks 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme\_gamma\_squeeze\_part\_two/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme_gamma_squeeze_part_two/)

While this is not financial advice, it is in my opinion that we need to do our best in holding and buying in order to get the stock price above $800 before Friday. This AI believes we fucking did it, lets prove the future right.

97,Update on AMC,"Hi everyone, one of the many apes from amc stock here and I just wanted to spend a moment to tell you guys my unsolicited opinion about whats going on with amc stocks.  Now the amc stock generally follows the same trend as gme but there are a number of factors that suggest that tomorrow (02/26/2021) could be a fantastic time for others to join in on the stock if they have any interest.

Now why would tomorrow be a good time to go in on amc?

1.) Short interest->  so the hedge funds attacked this stock super heavily today (02/25/2021) with shorts dropping it by just over 20%.  This has created a problem for the people gambling on amc stock to drop for two reasons. The first is that they are left with only 75,000 shares left total to play with tomorrow and secondly because they put AMC under ssr protection for all of 2/26/2021 which makes it increasingly difficult to continue to short the stock through tomorrow.  Now this is just one apes oppinion but if the hedges arent able to drop this stock down tommorow and all retail investors are buying and holding than I cant see why the stock wont shoot back up tommorow (I imagine most of the paper hands retail investors were scared off already by the huge dip we had today).

2.)Gamma Squeeze Potential-> So by the end of market hours tommorow there are a number of significant options expiring with the heaviest numbers starting at 8 dollars.  for example if amc ends at over 8 dollars than  61,263 options will activate equating to over 6 million shares being traded and gamma squeezing the price up by monday  (And that isnt even including all the options that activate <8).  At the moment the stock is sitting at about 7.50 and if my first point about the hedge funds is correct than 8 is a number that should be relatively easy to hit.

3.) long term value-> So should the worst situation happen and the stock plummets again tomorrow negating the chance for a gamma squeeze, than there is still value in keeping amc as a mid to long term stock.  We know that when amc diluted their shares they were able to refinance their debt with the money they gathered so bankruptcy for them is off the table through the rest of 2021.  That means they have until roughly mid 2022 to start generating profits and we all know that covid vaccinations are already starting to roll out, alongside the theatres which are starting to open up.

&#x200B;

And I just wanna end this by saying im not a financial advisor, just a random ape that has done a little DD and wants to share what I personally believe could be a good opportunity for us all to get those tendies.  Let me know what you guys think,thanks!

Sources for my info -> Fintel, yahoo finance, tdameritrade

&#x200B;

Edit: Hey guys I really dont wanna spread misinformation so I just wanted to point out that the amc stock being worth 20$ pre covid was wrong, looks like it was actually tanking through 2019 ending at around 8 when covid hits.
